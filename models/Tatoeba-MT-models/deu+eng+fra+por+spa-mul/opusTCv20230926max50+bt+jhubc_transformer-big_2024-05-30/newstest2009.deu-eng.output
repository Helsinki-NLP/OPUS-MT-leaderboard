The Prague stock exchange falls into the minus against business termination.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares achieved almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
Prague’s exchange started on Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points at the start of Tuesday’s business.
This time was the reason for the breakdown at Wall Street.
Even in Czech Republic, the market's reaction to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday, the stocks at the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes could compensate for some of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but could later compete for some of the losses, thus the decline to approximately 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8 percent, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then reduced their losses to 4.3 percent.
The exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.6% according to the index there.
“Timing for rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said the head of the currency authority in Hong Kong, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its currency policy itself, independently of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that other countries would be affected by the breakdown.
A blood bath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which should be spent up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč).
Thus, the legislators ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main share indexes recorded the biggest break in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped nearly seven percent, a similar break it last recorded in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but there was hardly a sign that the draft in the House of Parliament would not come through, the index had experienced a free case.
Congress: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The senior representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed in a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
This will be voted early next week.
The U.S. legislators reached a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the U.S. financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
Congress members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the end of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to different information, the Senate would likely be voted at the earliest Wednesday on the plan.
According to economists, a notification that the plan is adopted should be the first important psychological factor for the revival of the financial markets.
Then, however, it comes to a "encouragement" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have made a significant progress.
We have clarified our different views of how a package for the stabilization of the market should look like,” Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to their words, there may be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the Government Fund its final form.
It provides for a purchase of unsale mortgage assets from the financial companies that drop the financial companies into serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market as well.
We have to continue the health plan further, but I think we are at the goal,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis also declines significantly in the stock markets, which declines significantly.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
Indeed, we want to calm investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could influence trading on Monday.
But so far, it is not clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but there is also uncertainty whether the negotiations in the last minute could still fail in a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law will still experience some changes.
The total amount specified to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the payment of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, for another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Advanced in Negotiations Positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote over his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage papers whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgage.
“We’ve developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was satisfied by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “precies both-sided efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Senior Interlocutor, stated that the legislators agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a schedule for the financing of the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to supervise the Fund.
The Ministry of Finance is to lead them.
“We have worked hard and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects aid for homeowners who have problems with reimbursement of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages purchasing them, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs of debtors and allowing them to retain their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government are dividing losses among themselves,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week, Marek's view is not crucial.
"Most importantly, Congress members agree to support the plan and to say goodbye as soon as possible.
“The psychological importance of the agreement that there is an adoption is the most important at this moment,” said Marek.
Duell on knife cutting: MP3-player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
Therefore, it seems of course that it is better to just buy a phone.
In spite of all, there are plenty of reasons why you should agree to an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It is hard to buy a great expensive player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative perspective there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one such.
This is also simplified with music on travel, that is, with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but likewise, a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly power headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is widespread.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can’t even create meaningfully.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, telephone and simson, it can play music and videos, both record, it has a better, sometimes worse photo apparatus, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communications, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
However, the universality of the phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
Playing music is one of the biggest energy consumers.
Few phones can play music for more than twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music player (specially the simplest) is significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to play music no longer than a few hours.
If you are calling once and again, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - that also applies to expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep out at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the devices has a USB port, as well as no phone can be connected directly to a PC without a special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, except for exceptions (iPod) you do not need a special software.
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, arranged by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, user review.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When choosing a specific device, you should in particular ask about the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the user comfort.
If music is especially scenery and listen to it every day only shortly on the tram, for example, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone really can.
You don’t have to control which music formats a cell phone or player can process.
MP3 create everyone, and the majority of music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widespread, and moreover, most devices can play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to visit the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already and for itself be a suggestive argument for why you should access a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is usually limited only to quick radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, it is expected that just this kind of sale of music (whether on GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone wears most of themselves.
If you want to listen to something, grab the cell phone in your jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free speaking device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of music phones will be in price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar when operating with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
There is no threat to collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrible invoice for data transfers.
Which device should be taken
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But attention.
The basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you then have to place no more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more challenging listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent MP3 control buttons, and the comfort of the MP3 player is approached to that of a single MP3 player.
The largest is Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services as they are offered by their partners in West Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces classics at lower prices.
Perhaps he will not wait for a long time.
That the Czech mobile providers are working among the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This was confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which warned that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on roaming fees regulation, it is likely to come to a paradox situation - for some of the Czech mobile providers' customers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices so high in Czech Republic compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of the competition that really makes a fighting answer.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to shake that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (Czech Telecommunications Authority) (Czech Telecommunications Authority) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often stated that there is no room for another supplier in Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (also, he would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another way – a virtual provider.
Precisely the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile providers had to respond.
Prior to the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were voices similar to the Czech market in the UK.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don’t need to look for examples for a long time.
In February we reported this about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the five-largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns in Czech Republic, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target audience.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need a lot fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone talks and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good chess train to put on a non-clinic target audience.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose mobileking – the provider they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
Tough to say whether a similar concept might be able to catch foot as in Poland as well in Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický’s press spokesman also doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, he is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In Czech Republic, the mobile providers
However, it is almost sure that when a virtual mobile operator conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in Czech Republic, the negotiations are not very hopeful.
It will rather come to a market entry of mobilking in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, speaker of the Finance Group Penta, in a telephone call for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that current mobile operators in Czech Republic are not particularly appropriate to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Your interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has long been showing the GTS Novera Group, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business customers field.
“We have a great interest in providing our customers not only fixed networks but also mobile communications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators about this possibility.
With some of them we were already able to achieve negotiation progress," said the press spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times come now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far, this is surrounded by an inconceivable wall of silence.
“At this moment, we don’t assume that there is place in Czech Republic for a fully valid virtual provider.
The Czech market has large specifications compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2’s press department in its explanation for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also indicate the specification of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokesman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2: "Until we have found no viable and both-sided advantageous project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds: “In the T-Mobile network, a virtual provider will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a specific offer to be able to think so shortly.”
Vodafone rather focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: “For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of division of costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we view from customers’ perspective as the best.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The action of the mobile provider is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to a decline in prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be easier to enter the market?
The fact that the vendors can draw on a string when it comes to something, also demonstrates the long way around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ went at the moment when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is right as an argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competition in the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor on the market itself and above all its services would make high requirements.”
Given this approach, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprised by the mobile operators.
It is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition, unlike the UK and other highly developed states.
It only owns the Bureau for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But this concerned all of this problem with his very typical attitude.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual provider has come to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded until now, because the offering of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers,” said Chalupa in his answer to our inquiry from the ÚOHS Foreign Relations Department.
Such a formulation would not be surprised by representatives of the suppliers.
An authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, should make sure that no one abuses its position on the market is more than threatenable.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa added: “Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services.”
Probably, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, really shocking is the almost touching balance of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is on the hand.
Just like the absolutely equal gasoline price at the gasoline stations is certainly only accidental and the result of a hard competition fight.
“The authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate an action against the competition, and therefore it has no reason to interfere with the matter in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunication regulatory authority,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ČTÚ, according to telecommunications, is a single market from the perspective of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile provider has – logically – the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you don’t take this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are incredibly similar.
Complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the above-mentioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all providers.
The abolition of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances from the whole matter.
This was observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted novel of the Telecommunications Act has not been able to enforce the expansion of ČTÚ's competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of professionals had promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS only have to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's going on when no one looks
Notwithstanding, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers remains equal to several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies who spend their own prize lists for mobile telecommunications services but are only partly public.
Usually, they are companies that operate in multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services provide Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach to elected.
The joke of the thing is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similarly-typed reselling.
“If there are cases that you describe, it may be a breach of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society,” Martina Kemrová answered on our question.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing is not about the responsible of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
Indeed, from the activities of these companies, they are not overlooking profits, while, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický is aware of possible problems: “The law allows such speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone doesn’t run on their name, so they can’t have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile provider.”
But that alone, at least, would have to be strange.
Furthermore, there is another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile providers close their eyes before such action, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competencies to discover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to be satisfied with the statement of the providers, they knew nothing and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers has brought a significant decline in prices in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, just in these moments, the regulatory bodies that did not attempt to preserve the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator emerged, and followed another.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the entire case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclearness in the skills in these cases is more than favourable.
But let's not throw the flints into the grain.
If the background information is right and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may soon move again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing further interested parties (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new pictures of the National Hymn Where is my homeland on the occasion of the Czech State Day.
The hymn was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in chorus and an instrumental version.
The song record took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions right away.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech broadcast that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young, representative voices that are remarkable and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried to follow a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well so that a balance is created," he said.
The Czech national hymn will make its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music originated from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song became an organic part of the national hymn after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" hymn
Prague’s traffic farms are transporting on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s traffic companies as a date when the first passengers enter a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it at the same time on their chip map, in the info centers and branches of the traffic operations at the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraí Holešovice, Robylvice,
The coupons are also available on the websites of the traffic companies www.dpp.cz on the Internet since yesterday.
The service was used until afternoon by over 400 customers.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window in the underground stations where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
You are buying the coupon, in fact, via the internet, which is played on the opencard in one of the 13 branches of the city library.
“In these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to travelers who advise the interested party when buying the Internet and also play the coupon on the map,” says the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played onto the opencard self-service machines that are fitted in some subway vests.
How do such machines look?
They are red, remember ticket devaluators, the passengers may have noticed them already in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are five of them in the city at the moment, but until the end of the year it is expected to be eighty,” Opatrný adds.
Controls the coupon instead of the driver an automate
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just have to introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays up on your own.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
Thus, in the suburb trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia region enter the capital.
“In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated traffic, the train companions have readers that can check the time and zone validity of the coupons,” explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization.
The neighbourhood buses have card readers at the driver’s cash.
When entering, the chip card must not only be displayed for the driver, but the opencard must be set at a place marked on the side of the cash.
The driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
“If a passenger will check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr. Drápal said.
A passenger who doesn’t drive uptown buses and doesn’t know when the coupon’s validity ends, can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the map.
The information on the validity of its documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
Sudetes requested a decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the joining of the Bohmer forest to the United States.
This comes out of a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the rule of the United States of America.
With such a desire, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans have turned to the U.S. President.
This comes from, among other things, a letter retained in a private archive and today retained in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president to not allow the return of the "Sudetengus" - which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation properly and really want to be sure that the American units enter not as oppressors and enemies of the German territory, but as liberators,” a letter signed by the words “People to whom the fate of the Suddetes is on the heart.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans – in the light of the Czech national character – suspect that they would expect brutality, inconsciousness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the writers of the letter ask the U.S. President to take over today and forever the rule of protection over the Bohmer forest.
“We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this territory, you have promised a foreign state for us, suppressed and attempted to eliminate minorities, and purely nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies,” he said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President has doubts about the attitude of the Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to be part of the U.S. or under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of the post-war history may sound slightly naive, however, it, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudete Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least suggest that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa from Budweis.
He was used as a Budweiser in the Baltic Sea at the Navy in the war.
When he came in British captivity at the end of the war and was brought to Holstein into a war prisoner camp, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to them,” said Chalupa.
None of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that it would be driven out of the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don’t think, then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The worst action on safety on the roads in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport will launch on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s authority promises to dismiss drivers of dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns is running on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to drop the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol on the drive.
And they also remind them to bear themselves before the ride arrives.
The campaign wants to speak to consciousness above all young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don’t think, then pay!
The words "not think" are in large letters on a sign.
And in a blood lake then the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of unattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock the viewers" by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see very normal pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads will decline.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and beetle for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto applies to sugar bread and pitch.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when you drive with red, you save time.
The crack is the threat of a punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.
Even less effective, he thinks, boards that draw the drivers attention to a danger.
“If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive them,” says Korán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, pronounced the return of almost all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be closed in exchange for it.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to depart to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli areas) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return will also include East Jerusalem.
“The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in a reference to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Premier’s words, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the temples and holy and historical places” that are located on the territory of the Old Town.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won’t work,” he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan heights
Olmert explained for a removal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he believed is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
This would also require efforts from Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they will grant to the terrorism of (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al Khaida and the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know it, in a remote bus is not allowed to walk around.
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to go and go in the bus while driving.
“If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is in contradiction with the road traffic law,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old steward killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at that moment for all the misfortune next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or sharply brake when the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
One role also plays whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter after also standing seats.
If this is not provided in the bus, the travellers must sit.
Student Agency’s remote travel buses have no standing seats; what confirmed the company’s director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travelers.
Later it was taken back, and we have reached a consensus that travelers can go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he added.
The law does not know steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no law describes this role.
However, there is no law that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the term vehicle companion; but its rights and duties do not define it,” adds Hanzelka spokesman.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, says that the law covers this issue subsequently.
“It’s up to whether the bus also has standing seats in the product license.
That’s all then,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing and the maximum speed is limited, traffic buses with standing and higher permitted speed and remote travel buses without standing with the highest permitted speed and seating equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the professional
The BESIP Traffic Safety Professor Jaroslav Hořín sees no basic problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
“In a liquid driving way, there are not many risks, the situation is comparable to the service on board a plane.
Even here isn’t sure when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit his head.”
However, if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must clarify the carrier through internal regulations,” he said and also believes that this issue is not fully solved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider his job as risky even after the accident.
“Once I get the impression that the profession of the steward is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travellers when entering.
That would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin founds the lack of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have a stewart, but we’re against it from the beginning.
Before or later, this ends with any deadly accident,” he did not speak for Týden.cz a year ago.
This was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen was ashamed, who had worked two years for the society.
The Slovenian truck was probably arched off the stand strip without having to blind and had blocked the drive to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the stewards, Jančura denies.
"These seats cannot be reserved on remote connections, they are blocked."
The company will prosecute truck drivers.
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for court judgment, but it also expects a financial compensation from the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in view
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-head expert team of the Ministry of Transport works already over a year.
“This, however, has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the drive,” said Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly threaten the safety of travelers,” says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses in the competence of the police and the labour safety agencies.
Düsseldorf hopes to rest in Frankfurt
Great words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB Board to the employees of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, the "central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finance Group" could be created, it said in the letter that was made known on Monday.
The WestLB brought a "competence block" with sustainable yields into such a business.
And at all, such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further fusions in the country bank sector.
This is how it is read when a Board of Directors wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which the Northern Rhine-Westphalia state government has recently made clear to pressure the time to find a future solution.
Of a connection between the Deka Bank, which is known to savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB, however, has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deca-Bank Chief Franz Waas made known in the presentation of the half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is held half by the state banks and the savings associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, however, have just started, as it is said at the financial place.
From the Deka Bank, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square, it is not the first time to speak when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
But there was nothing from this trial.
Little as the plans were becoming public, the Hessian state government spoke against a participation of the Helaba.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been always thought games about connecting the Deka Bank with the national banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had spoken against plan games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the understanding that a cluster of the various houses of the public law sector has a challenge.
After the landtag election in Bavaria is over, the BayernLB could first be closer to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure to further mergers rises, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be more junior partner, although she has so far undergone the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In connection with the West LB, in turn, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen and Giroverband, which is involved in the Helaba with 85%, has pushed a rope in the beginning of the year.
Left the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit each other.
In June, Merl, the decisive question of which business model to ensure the future of the state banks, has not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be a breakdown, but it is self-desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the Board of Directors there, it is also discussed that a "total solution" for the House will definitely be sought.
How it can be put under a hat with the combination of individual units with the deca-bank, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it’s the first time for Luca, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is with her friend, so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the Kaiser’s five-liter bier fashion, a massively built beartiger stands and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a flap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking place next to Puorta Nuova train station, start this evening at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arriving expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, travelling in a bus only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking space, the South Americans are singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that this is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimitate feed and a glasses with wide silver ironing, include the buses.
For five years, they’ve gone to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
In the night, at 22.30 a.m., on the wilderness.
Overnight staying would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
€75 costs the trip, the welcome tour with Kaiser-Beer, braided faithfully to the Bavarian purity offer, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling in the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, travelers will sleep.
Well, they will still need their strengths.
Maintained in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where some other buses with Italian signs are also taken a break on the 8th highway just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives plannedly at half a.m. in the morning on the parking place near the Theresienwiese, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cat.
On the left stands "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors open to the beer tent, it says it runs!”, Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The size, Marco cryshed, costs 8.25 euros.
And do not forget drinking money.
“Safety people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they are gone.”
Third: "Today's evening Item half eleven find here again!"
And we're going to the Wiess.
Along the way, a yellow cap is bound to the trees, to signs and even to the election draft of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be ready for the withdrawal.
It is the second weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There is no accurate information about numbers; the speech is about 50,000 who are going on the road across the Alps and invented into the beer tents, 10 percent of all visitors are supposed to be traveling extra from Italy this weekend.
Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics, in which the Italians before Brits (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) have the first place with about 200 medical care.
Especially popular among Italians is the courtyard.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German bank system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
As good that the politician used the word “relative” and still agrees that the German banking sector will not be saved from the critical developments.
Because it happened on the weekend.
Munich’s real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said on Monday to Reuters that the credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only rate the portion it takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses in the daughter Defa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has awarded money, the state financer had refinanced itself extremely short-termly – which is now no longer possible due to mistrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s barreserve declined by 95% to 2.37 million euros, even the equity rate had slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions dropped to zero compared to the previous year period, the revenues from awards to claims and certain securities and the dissolution of revenues in the credit transaction dropped by more than 70% to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from subsequent refund costs from the restructuring of the former Defa Group, as well as from the refund of interest under the tax regulation and from the business care of group companies, the revenue reduction with approximately 16 percent was still moderate.
The former state financer had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatization in 1990, which had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because it was too little earned in classical state financing, the Defa had then been involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make descriptions that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, hot it quite undefined.
The fact is that the dividend has been removed.
It has been cut by two-thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer since Defa’s acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions depending on refinancing the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loans among the banks are largely declined again, as the banks have their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires annually short-term funds for refinancing for a part - around 50 billion euros - of the Defa’s loan portfolio.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the funding needs of the group with the loan are covered for expected time and the company is "protected from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets".
From other sources, it is heard that thanks to the funds, refinancing was guaranteed by the end of 2009.
HRE Board Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets at expectable time.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are expecting the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group to be secured.
This means hoping for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and inescapableness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to exclude.
After hearing in the late Sunday evening after the bank still before insolvency, at least the provisional rescue cannot calm the minds.
The equity rate is decreased by 75% to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond courses are good.
If priority debts are hardly moved, the courses of subsequent bonds are more clear.
In particular, the bonds of the previous subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected, and understandably, the durations beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-state bonds previously supposed a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institute itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the defa.
As long as the banks, governments and less sponsored business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as pensions can be removed at the time.
Or it happens what no one dares to hope today - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the coming 15 months.
However, given the reports overcome with the sub-nationalization, the probability that is bordered by security is currently only a legitimate hope.
This should especially make long-term believers a few sleepless nights to decide whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a final section to form a loss leaflet for future payment tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is scheduled to imagine on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to kick: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
“The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn’t miss.
The beginning of the class seems not as strictly fixed at Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start from eight o'clock until twenty before nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the home room.
But before the lesson started, I was committed to imagine.
I am not the guy who likes to speak before people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I attracted an old rock of my guest mother, including blue knee shoes, blue knee shoes and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the pult and tried to pronounce everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm named Sylvana, comes from Germany and have birthday in a week.
I was very happy that I had started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all touched, kicked and wanted, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the essential survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, cute."
Then I'm quickly dushed to my place.
The girl next to me was pretty wide, she found an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was actually disturbed.
Everyone spoke unto each other and kicked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of her Bentos packed out.
My guestmother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something different from the desert German breads.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu mantle.
I usually don’t have a black shimmer, exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says that everything is really delicious.
Well, until the salty inserted plums maybe, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to a boy, whom she then creates particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read this in my manga comics.
I'm looking forward to whether I can watch this too.
“Why just Japan?” my girlfriends asked me when I told them I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading the most loved mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So for me, I was completely clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And there is a great deal of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or a shell flies in danger does it mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers in a series to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should hope at least because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut questions of sense or generally of consciousness, we enter unfortunately ground because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, escapes, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists close to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is likely to be in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness does not depart from language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differs very much from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look with other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, due to the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research poses great problems to us.
Most of my statements relate to the contents of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that might be more accessible.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and exactly that happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this approach, which followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one moves more to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the cause mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the achievement of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I lead them back to the activation of an emotional system such as that of fear in one of its own activity conscious brains.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, as physical reactions) shows memory.
Thus, feelings are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular people.
Combined with the linguistic nature, fine grades of sense arise because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of the words and grammar states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio means that feelings from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but focusing more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much throughout human evolution, it could be quite involved in intergender sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is undetectable.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably feels like this in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly?
Does a shave flee in danger if it feels fear?
In my eyes, simply behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equal experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and people have similar brain trimes, but shapes don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to humans: how do you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even shaves (who knows?), have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably essentially different from ours (as human awareness is based on special circuits and language), I rather explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level is achieved, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, or feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You might think that is short-sighty, but I rather move forward than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts go behind.
Even the number of EM stages may be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the highest speed now," Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis said.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in mind."
Another more radical step has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki said at the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-ligists had been convicted alone last season for manipulation to forced decline, finally even the league launch had to be displaced in the short term.
Dennis Quaid Returns
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with former Hollywood star Meg Ryan outdated her left Dennis Quaid as a adulter.
The foam - and hits back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unbeatable dispute with each other – in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not found until the divorce.
Ryan's new movie "The Women" told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly felt: “It’s horrible,” 54-year-old said in the New York Daily News, “Meg repeatedly rebuilt the story of our relationship and overwhelms it.”
It is also "unfortunate" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the conversions that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And thus his inmissions conclude with the side here: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel happy that I have a wonderful family that works well.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than last year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights became up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and nights in hotels have become cheaper again – this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and observed a significant break in the second quarter after a rise in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the nights in many places have already increased.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities studied still rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than last year.
The most clear trend in Paris and Rome was where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a “declining travelling pleasure of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Even on flight prices, the trend in the first quarter showed up:
Due to cherosing control, travellers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-range flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the Economy class ticket prices dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices broke even greater than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6%.
On German domestic flights, the prices have even halved.
The reason for the price break is, on the one hand, lowering economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is clever.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure through the open skies agreement, which liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Signs of the tense situation were the removal of unprofitable routes with Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines who had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – these were 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV hits Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV table guide becomes.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breaking landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher arrived late in the game and failed to latte with a lift.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
“We need the second gate,” said Hermann Rieger at the Hamburg Arena.
A lot wasn't gone into the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapist, he enjoys a higher reputation than some actors.
And thus his request was also hearing in responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and agreed to the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
His command is similar: Her with Gate Two!
The implementation remained.
"There wasn't anything beautiful to watch today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have “desired more relaxed.”
The 1:0 (1:0) was due to Mladen Petric’s headball hit; and the fact that very weak Gladbachers were unable to hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarised.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers on Saturday afternoon once celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class premier.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," Marcell Jansen said.
He knows that the table intermediate certificate is more for the unpredictable of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-obliged accesses – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the tower sniper Petric and the Jansen announced by FC Bayern – is slow but cannot shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol said.
After the vote
At Wall Street, fear is going on.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break up by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later the Dow started something again.

No title could be gained.
The Goldman Sachs bank’s shares declined by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers are to be provided.
But the sum is to be paid not on a single hit, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive credits of stock options from financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of appropriate price development to reduce the burden on the state cash.
Stock rates in Europe and the United States

Dark Matter Influences Flight from Space Sounds
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused ratlessness: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by manoeuvres.
Experts are afraid that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory couldn’t be quite correct.
Almost eighteen years the Ulysses space probe fled through the space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel lines, she now threatens the coldness.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon causes confusion - the swing by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes where they get additional vibration in the gravitational field of a sky body, about Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprising for years: the carriers do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the ancient gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities at speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him swing by anomaly.
Some experts are afraid that possibly even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the attractiveness of matter through a curvature of the space, could not be completely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton continues to believe that Einstein does not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have exempt in the universe.
“Responsible for anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers know about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attractive force from her, whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter is a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists in Egypt will be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Redemption negotiations are already being held.
Repeatedly Germans go into the vision of Kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE signals the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: “Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well-being and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
Unclearly, the backgrounds of a shooting remain before the hostages were released: therefore, the kidnappers were ready, according to an Egyptian security officer, to terminate the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "just about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "that surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had requested a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling for a German intermediary, the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape trouble.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of step-father "led to suicide"
The abuse of her step-father for years has led to a woman killed herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly held his step-daughter Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle was killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her and connected her eyes before she performed sexual actions while her mother was away to work in a guest house.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who worked a large part of her time volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that had been added to her two times a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "was given up her life"
In April 2007, her true father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by drowning herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's step-father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I used to chain her and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t sexually force her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially as she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worst still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it hadn’t done this.”
He added: “I take attention to the effects, according to the description of Stephanie’s father and mother, of her act on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would clearly be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data are accused
The BBC reported that the officer, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged with the Public Security Act.
The man was deployed by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, “You had thought that it would be dealt with internally with the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged with in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the Metropolitan Police accuse the officer for the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capacity of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought by his house to a secret place.
Apartment companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the BSA, Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that societies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will ultimately be paid back when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are deleted.
But the interest rates accumulated in the meantime are counted annually to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully ... are now called to take on some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits that would keep it, and that companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rates for the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to purchase 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the organisation of housing companies, told the BBC that he believes that this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully during real estate recovery are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were in 1945.
“We will look at all aspects of this thing over the next few weeks to see which alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest rates that will be paid in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be paid for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both-sided organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on savings.
Milk becomes five pences per liter more expensive
People in Jersey face themselves to have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pens per liter from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers should decide themselves whether they want to pass the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price rise in February, Jersey Milk’s gross market price changed last in 2002.
Former prime minister of Bangladesh refused deposit
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a deposit request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
His defenders said the court denied deposits about the charge to have expressed 50 million taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several floating accusations of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s long-standing political rival Khaleda Zia was released for deposit earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-based transitional government to first grant her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that although their suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear whether it will continue to stay on foot when returning to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say that they will now appeal to the Upper Court of Justice against the decision of the Upper Court.
“The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s deposit request because it says she doesn’t have to receive any deposit because she’s already on detention abroad to be treated abroad,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a complaint against the above court."
Their lawyers use that they need deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a Awami Alliance Party Chairman said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government took over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, denied all charges against him.
Fears about the Anti-Polium Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that thousands of vaccinating employees did not attack or hinder.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV broadcast.
The competition appeal court has prescribed BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to unfairly influence the ITV broadcast.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB provided doubts about the independence of ITV, which has caused the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communication Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV is an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced to wish to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Attorney's Affair
The U.S. Prosecutor-General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of the administration employees were criticized.
The report exerted criticism of the officials of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers were discontinued for political reasons.
Specialist minister Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators to hinder the justice.
Serious allegations including criminal procedures have not been completely investigated or clarified, General Inspector Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 entered nine US prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the court persecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are responsible for investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time but cannot be suspended for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Prosecutor-General Alberto Gonzales, was under arrest because of the dismissals, and finally detained his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also terminated.
The report of the General Inspector has particularly critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "major responsibility" for dismissals, "leading his leadership role" and showing himself "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush’s former Chief Advisor Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize next week in London during the award, said he was honoured to be recognized.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" takes the nominations for the award this year after it has come to the closer selection in four categories.
The head editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared in the UK as a single in sale in 1979 and reached 15th in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out Of Hell” has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was a surgery in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after it collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to revoke concerts due to an acute inflammation.
It was later known that he had a cyst on his voting tape.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic roads, streets, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others are only convenient.
Nevertheless, it’s hard even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and rather looks like a dusty gate rather than an actively used crossroads.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to replant Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
The other worshippers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short streets, just because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, responsible for protecting and building the residential buildings and responsible for the street, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the municipal council this month, representatives of the municipal administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the property of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers to repair the road and run what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road will re-plant and set up seats, among other things, for a café that the company wants to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, she did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed streets and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop real estate rather than manage.
Compared to its colourful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street was named in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB musical club, the punk rock memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is most known as the scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of rubbish, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some inhabitants, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog named "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the extincting city"), has published a part of the conversation of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackcloth that remains dark even during the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying past rainbows weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly so recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where there is a costly clothing shop today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and a empty beer bottle was on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of outranged newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be somewhat polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the excitement of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet, and evil.
Debate about two-lingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-lingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Scientific Officer in Caliphonic Studies and Senior Director in Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-writer of the book "Not as well as thinking: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
To address the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s suggestions on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentioned that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students to successfully complete school is lower than white students" - which is true.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama’s educational plan especially recommends a two-lingual transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his engagement in two-language education, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, is opposed to his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Let’s take an example of “Sixth Street Prep”, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Surprisingly, 93% of children from the fourth school year were also evaluated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach to which the education is running in an English-speaking environment. That’s exactly the point that Obama should take into account, says the school director Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialty lessons.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-lingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had come from Mexico shortly before it. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational political positions within its own party (the national non-image groups have long supported the idea of two-lingual education) and its own consistent support for two-lingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation targeting "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the distance of performance, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
Oil price drops as a result of fears around the economy
The oil price fell strongly on Monday due to the fear that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be able to revive the economy.
Raw oil deadlines at the New York Trade Exchange have fallen by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on Wall Street and strong turmoil storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel this month, then rising again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have revealed concerned again, although congress representatives had announced they had agreed on a rescue plan on weekends that should be the biggest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is expected to purchase the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to a government statement on Monday.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears to have failed to revive the mood on the markets.
Since the economic situation is further deteriorating, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the American virus spreads worldwide, especially to China."

Team record by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he ran more often in the jets suit in the last eight and a half years than anyone else.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an unresultated game into a triumph train.
“I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Ellis said.
After a slim game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yards touchdown, this marked the perfect start to a afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which one time slipped out as an outside defender and the other one time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I didn’t try to look particularly,” Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took away.
Darrelle Revis, an outside defender, took a collapsed worm and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazy one.
The cardinals had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the match when the jets re-conquered the ball and turned Jay Feely to a 20-year shot to a 34-to-0 leadership.
These were the most points the jets ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said, "Believe me I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time.”
Evacuated Gebrselasia Beats His World Record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again demonstrated why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who managed the track of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds that he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, where he has reached at least one World Championship title on each track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has left the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear that was perhaps overwhelmed afterwards that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions – at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination – gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat switched from Kenya to long distances, the record time for marathon has fallen more than 2 minutes over the past 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with results 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had crashes in his wade two weeks ago and therefore couldn’t train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after break and not roasted back.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end of everything great."
He has been criticized for this – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from Eastern Africa – that he has over-orchestrated his racing, generally avoids many world’s best marathon stars, relies too much on the racing leaders as if this was a rail race, and world records over the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of gears as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge gebrselassy after the tempomakers had dropped down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made its last entry to separate from Kwambai, which came as a second in 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time for nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a significant year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh-fast result of all time.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury, however, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She had planned her running by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only, but overcoming after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and straps in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the exhausts of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the bright, sound and giant trends, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston made in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavens, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous Harlem Renaissance author.
And yet, the city that describes it is and remains – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida guide that was produced at the time of depression by the federal writer project – in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, strong and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "as little knows about us he doesn't know what he escapes."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential department, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial conditions, many here are still tired of being observed by outsiders.
“We are very interested in how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to an inhabitant of the city and a community member of the oldest church of the city.
It has to be right.”
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a high town of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black rural culture of the south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It’s not surprising that inhabitants here are both proud and on the hat.
And so correctly the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all call Hurston here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from hearts and were written in speech, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenery of black history and human drama.
Frequently like Oskar in real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
“Away from the road to the left,” she wrote, “is the brown-white-shaped modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares for, although he can hardly read and write.”
She also mentioned the new man of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and what-ever fits with hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
“Zora described things as they were,” says Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls, citing the men singing about her beauty full of sexual advantages.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Here you still remember Hurtson as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she usually did it without warning, in a sound chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that even today imagines something on her honorable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never remained too long," he added while swing in his chair, on a terrace behind looking at the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were overwhelmed.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville there were no big memory celebrations, no public readings in large style.
“I don’t think they have understood their contribution in the world or their legacy in the least,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows”, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed the 4th highway through the western town.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture hate brought into the community.
“In this time often came a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff to the people sitting away,” Franklin said.
“There was even one woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel questioned the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration, describing his decision in the case of Brown against the school council as "offensive instead of respecting my race".
Inhabitants today say that although the abolition of race separation in some ways was positive, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his young people.
“Black children were used to be armed – I remember – to be armed with their teacher in the morning and to be armed with their teacher in the evening,” says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there’s a cultural gap there,” Nathiri said.
However, citizens’ rights have helped create space for other Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors and artists who defeated prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: “How can anyone refuse the pleasure of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her glory.
Five years later, a much-promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelves, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The remote road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again was in light of the public.
And this time Hurston’s old neighbors saw them as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track remote road lived the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, awakened real citizens' style," Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more trainers came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has gone here to the church since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was incorporated into the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new single-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the neoplastered and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville remains a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city center of Orlando can sometimes feel like a backway in the summer rain, as small as then when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Nowadays it is 90% black.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval in advance is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white and black men at field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston festival became greater, an increased degree of home tree was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautifully, with all his problems, neither worse nor better, and as proud, creative and effortless, stupid and mixed as any other race and people group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police who might need some help.
And even the young people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
“Most people who only go through here will think, ‘Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others’,” said Alondra Kenon on Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we talk fluently about financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they wouldn’t even realize that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopole in New York, every day have the worst horror work day since the exchange crash of 1929.
Suppliers still move the metal tea weights along citizen cliffs and transport tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still snorkeling between apartments around, such as human packaging animals charged with around the 50 bending T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for themselves on the citizen climbs on their breakfast bagel and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a week day between 16:00 and 19:00.
It didn’t feel like a crisis until Thursday afternoon because of all the end of the world, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory time on the quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family, about 20 people were snake.
Not to the money exchangers to remove or pay money, but to the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most ahead of me, so later I learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license," were for the same reason as I was snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already raised their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they hanged, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had removed money from so-called Thrifts (a little bit resembled to a construction savings), cooperative banks and those local savings cash that only have been in a state stores, saying they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have been silent and quietly cracked.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments worth $327 billion, went over in bankruptcy administration and when late Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that has spare investments worth $440 billion, looking for a saved buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop employees brought their bars before me to a bank that is considered a secure port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have applied a flowing financial latein in recent weeks.
A woman who spoke in my Chinese stem supermarket took so much confidence to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went out, and her destroyed Board Chairman Dick Fuld, as if she blasphemed about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who came from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery around the 50-year-old concierge of my residential block.
“I have all my savings in money market funds now,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I’m no longer going into risk.”
Muslim graves disrupted during legal rush in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist of the Austrian Right Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams Belang, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organization "City Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, painted with a red line.
Police accused right-wing extremists of the grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extremely right-wing parties of the country's parliamentary elections.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun in Linz were seriously damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe this for an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" over the message of the grave damage that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of consciousness research is held in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties received almost 30% of the votes, engaged in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their election claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, took place for a ban on head towels and Burkas and even took aware of his abstinence to foods that are generally connected to Islam.
During his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent Islam’s growth.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which state that the extreme rights are the politically strongest block in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, has been prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges set Glitter a six-month lock after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a foreign trip closure after submitting evidence to the judges of Glitter's prosecution for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a true name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Official Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
On Thursday, 25 September, the police requested the Kent authorization to prevent Mr. Paul Glad’s foreign trips to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.”
As required by the Sexual Criminals Register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or glitters possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesman for Kent’s police unit said, “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
"Our view is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
“It’s the main concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offencers in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport control and he fled after some of them to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials urged him to return to Britain.
Lastly, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the court of Uxbridge in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for the authorization to be able to register as a sex criminal.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in 1999 for 4 months in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith is calm and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
“I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character,” Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no wrists, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
Artists on the one hand
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in those moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find gestures typical for the personality, the depth of a stolen eye or expression strength of the hands that are worried because they are not entering the stage.
In his project ‘Flamenco-people’, the German photographer Günter Bauer represents an alternative Theatralik of some scenes on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page, he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flame coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of Flamenco’s photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day, explains the artist and clearly explains that ‘Flamenco-people’ can be anyone, but if you look at the photographs, the viewer notices that it is a typical picture of artists.
Entirely normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on the stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take photos on the stage.
Her personality and character is in her hearts.
What I was interested was to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to hold the characters of the biggest flamenco masters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Cante de las Minas Festival, went on a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that reminds classic photography.
The application of various stylist means destroys the classic foundation of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: ‘Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day’.
These are not only the dance, the song, or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character that seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the firm objective of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion to the portraits led him to re-access this idea two years ago and to realise it as ‘portraits of the veterans of the sport’ (‘SportART project’).
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project are different, so the photographer gives me a great deal to photograph people, meet them, and put me in their state of life, whether it’s for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You’re meeting or hitting people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they’re leaving you alone for a couple of minutes to be able to take a photo.
Besides these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of today's Flamenco portraits entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the Roma he currently writes is ‘a great boldness’.
He still doesn’t know where the novel is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prize winner admitted that the project he deals with is ‘a great boldness’ and ‘all points out that he would not have to write the novel’.
“If I was prudent, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will do it and I hope to end the novel at some point,” he concluded his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of ‘La ciudad y los dogs’ was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium Hay Festival and gave the most present their voice, is compared to the old edition of ‘Our mutual friend’ and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Felix Romeo and found that he had an audience before himself, which realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, wasn't given sufficient time to be able to pass through everything, how he does his appeal to the literature, how he does, how he does, how he does, how he does.
The Hispanic American novel writer admitted that there is ‘no way’ in which to measure and how to know whether books change life, but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a flying experience’, emphasized Vargas Llosa, who claims that it’s ‘effects’ provoke more, and people’
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather didn’t play with: bull fighting were partially off.
After the announced bull fighters noticed that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bull fighting festival to complete the festival in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with Fermín Bohórquez’s consent, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the Bull Fight Festival.
Thus, the festivity of the inconstant weather was exposed, which is why two out of three celebrations were unable to take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bull fighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the Bull Arena.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who triumphed three ears, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bird, which he had succeeded more through galopping than through his bird’s arts.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had fought so badly, much of the audience responded in his second struggle with Buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape control of their car, which was charged with two thousand kilos of Hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers urged the drivers to stop the car, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they wouldn’t have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand pounds of Hashish.
The police tracked her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who was 28, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of Interior of the Basque State reported.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers in the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out road control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometres on the edge, and at that moment the drivers went out of the car to escape a land road into a forest area.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two, and in the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 pounds of Hashish, which was captured by the police.
The front part of the car was charged with hashish gangs, which were later directed for the precise laboratory analysis and to move the bundle to further police offices.
Furthermore, officials noted that the identification mark was ‘double’, so it did not match the identification mark specified in the vehicle papers, and therefore was also a detention for counterfeiting official documents.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. A. J., arrested, was brought to a police office for hearing and will be presented to the court in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, because of driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness has observed she tried to exit her parking gap in Montecito in a quite strange way, spokesman of the California Traffic Police reported to the magazine People.
The witness detailedly told that Locklear's gas pedal was pushed through and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking gap, and as she went back, she took herself a few times on her sunglasses.
A little later, the Witnesses, who initially had probably not recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and left the car.
The witness was the person who notices the emergency service because she had anxiety to live for Locklear's.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, who stood across the street and thus blocked the traffic.
They seemed to be oriented, so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials resulted in, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought to an local investigation detention at about 19:00.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insisted that the Andalusian Association of the United Nations Left will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Nations Left, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former town Council for Youth and Sports in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
"In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it," Llamazares pointed out what action the party has to have to face with the one who has so far been sitting as a town council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the emergency of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule breaches that Silva could have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases gained maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he emphasized that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
Blood of Mayo: Hero Buch von Garci
Inspired by ‘Episodios Nacionales’ by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in ‘Sangre de mayo’ represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to depict a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novel writer, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performer.
'Sangue de mayo' with a movie length of more than two and a half hours, is presented in cinema this Friday and later on the Telemadrid station as a four-hour miniserie.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures that thanks to this work his 'Childhood Straum' was fulfilled. This he owed Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a memory film for the second century celebration on 2 November in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for shooting, offers Garci, as he added, the “one-time possibility” with the help of decorations and corresponding clothes, the picture of “making confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the battle, because the people had been brought into the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that it could not be able to count on financing such as ‘Alatriste’ or ‘Los ghosts de Goya’ (two times as high as ‘Sangue de Mayo’), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked his entire career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of the film in ‘Volver a beginning’, helped by his ordinary way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you first have to sample before you start to work and to know for those who had not done casting, he appeared in the ‘humiliating’ and respecting in the film’ to happen in the work.
Many actors he’s going on in Sangre de Mayo have to repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), believes and assured that neither of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
“In the beginning you believe that you’re working for the descendants, later you realize that it’s only for growing, and now you’re satisfied when you’re still producing a movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayon calls back the memory of dancers from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in Eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and sat down for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayon fascinated the life of this woman who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We are not trying to tell about her life, especially to keep her spirit,” the flamenco dancer said.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the butterfly came to me like Guajira, or the dance of the snake, like tango.
Her dance was sensually and I have been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The stage is expecting two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in ‘La puerta abierta’; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her former students.
‘Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he played the role of the artist.
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman who became known in so far-reaching places such as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain era, and none of her works today, and that is why she doesn't appreciate anything less," says Bayon.
The presentation takes place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book ‘Diario de un poeta nouveau casado’ also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of ‘Diario de un poeta recentemente casado’ in the Saint Stephen’s Church, New York, in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned death activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, and to celebrate the ‘Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’ (2006).
The triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum by Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia, and with the hiking exhibition, Juan Ramón Jiménez, was now opened in the place of the New York, and Aquel Chopo de Luz.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of ‘Diario de un poeta recentemente casado’, published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso.
The U.S. can imagine badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in ‘sensation reporter’, and from the ruling idea of the American cinema that was left out, from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic presentation came and followed her.
Look at what it cost to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, this was a big blow for everyone.
“What sometimes one feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said crying, “My life and my country were the biggest drawbacks of his life.”
No one was afraid to make himself ridiculous or overwhelming.
As a ‘father’ of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the market breakdown, where Americans’ destroyed self-esteem is looking for hopeless reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only few people who can admire stay, you don’t necessarily need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a platonical ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation, which prescribed the fight against drugs and in honor of his son’s first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded until his own brand of homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to compete against a deadly nutritional culture.
A broad wave of surprise blows houseover Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man has died, but the entire era.
Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“We’ve left the biggest of all of us,” George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who trust today try to live like Paul Newman lived: gained high demands for righteousness, a responsible private life, leading far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and then was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have a filet at home?” he often shamed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was none as proud of that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are lacked.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we ready for that?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not right!
She was called a perfect street, and after my assessment, she was the worst street with everything that was there.
Of course, that’s a lot of foolishness if you would consider the rating and I could check it, what wouldn’t have happened clearly.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The foolishness begins with the ticket collection that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you do already, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid stacking on the street).
So, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first fool that is to go there only because) and (after an infinite waiting line) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only in size `S' (a second fool because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
Well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road began and we didn’t leave our backbags ahead of it, even if it was once successful, but to get them back would be more difficult.
In addition, it appeared to wait after rain in this 40 minutes, so it came to the temptation to organize a folk uprising and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never be thinking of me.
So I think we will still dream of a city well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new picture detection system and human-interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is able to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft’s system), which is a router to move on.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can see how many people in the room are, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the present in the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist’ notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads to her conversation, and that not a company employee either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things it can focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week we talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just one conclusion, considering that Microsoft in Windows versions adds one or another function and 'extras'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the internet, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have noted that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's true.
The system will never disappear, but one has to think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the ‘Windows’ surroundings.
What does half of existing applications serve on the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easy, not excessive, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without doubt, I bring a little example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
A shield is attached to the refreshing drinking machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees were using Microsoft, Google for research on the Internet.
By the way, last week has also been confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft seeks the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola.
When we begin to count the countless stars appearances, we can take back to the picture of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard who had raised heavy weights in a hiking circle.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English speakers call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuloux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle ‘Marcel’, the legend tells that the names are associated with sports and stammed by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
‘La Marcel’ exceeds all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cuts, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag that has these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of ‘tanks’.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Trousers, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as a underwear.
You're very lovely.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is delicate, but full of life pleasure.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who preserve their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, placed her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in the fashion that sponses the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and ashamed, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and took partly to Valentino’s honor.
A very intense working hour that is simultaneously exciting.
You are working for the Spanish house, what is the foundation of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the movie of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but ultimately, everything happens in one and these areas have many common things.
Since I was little, I was excited about clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wine around in my aunt's clothes cabinets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like so much to have our own style in lessons and in the samples to look in the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real role of actor.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've recently become 30, aren't you fallen into crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I have done the things that I wanted to do since I was a little bit and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, right?
For a long time I know that I’m becoming a mother because that’s what my body wants and I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to let that go away.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate it with a lot of love.
As for the film art, you keep in the eyes the works you have participated in and were shot last year.
That is exactly how it is and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and disturbed and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tomb de Cristo' be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's fine, don't tell you.
It’s not that I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to take part at a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know two clothes were auctioned from our collection for Mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
There's a lot of things told about them, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great-hearted thing, but when she comes and asked me to make a stand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be returned due to the alcohol level will need to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official punishments for the alcohol level, installed this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in drunk condition.
The initiative has been announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the Attorney General, which is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the driver’s re-socialization, which is why the driver gets a course for re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers, who were shown more than once under alcohol influence due to driving, re-controlled.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhausted air and prevents auto start when the driver has done alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is determined higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of regulatory breaches in the first year after its launch.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved annually.
The action is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: taking this behavior before it is worth a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legitimate reform can be carried out on the ordinary path, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been built in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Only tomorrow, the House of Parliament will be voted for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidencial hangar of Benito Juárez de México airport DF, the Spanish Air Force plane landed, traveling with the prince and princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that went out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the prince and the princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people with you at the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived a couple of years here.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport’s hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 navy soldiers who give honorary salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, with long hair weakened by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', maybe she was told that it is expected a storm in DF.
Before you enter the hall, smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official follow-up is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, waiting for her a reporter from the Mexican television who likes to joke.
The Best Premium of Fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a fashion premium and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for promoting and internationally increasing young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost crying because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second largest business in Europe and recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the contest. All ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board of directors, organized by Mango, seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken from the pain because his brother recently died, ripped together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and drawn some jewelry things from ELAH, which were stunning. He stood on the arm of his son Louis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended along with the baron of Redschild without jackets, because jackets have borrowed the ladies.
Monica Cruz, had a trousers and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to the dinner she weared a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she's in excitement and remembered a kind of attack of the old times, Stang.
Inés Sastre did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always causes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own bed layers and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, so is life.

Speaking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (each day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no one reason that causes this appearance.
Relations are often searched for with other appearances in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedding at night), speaking at night, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stressful situations or overcome.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, blossom, or it can be quite a contrary (writing, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to be advised with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and happens in this way.
We have said it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and something too wild.
In nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs once in sleep, it tries to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests out.
Remember, if a pair of appearances are fearful, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid.
When they understand what it says (which isn’t so usual), the child doesn’t put pressure to carry out an audience and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Furthermore, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that, therefore be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, that’s a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirst railway, illhouses on the field are finally going back to the course of success.
Without great effort, the Yellow-Black played numerous gates and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter at which the attackers were trying to show their capabilities wasn’t very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kaufmann, whose remote shot just passed the angle, ill houses should easily dominate the game, and alternately it was able to first fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a foot-top shot to challenge the Defense of Denmark.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and only left the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be crucial with two gates first fighted by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately then with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, who stood exactly correctly to take back a ball that had been defeated in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the illegal gateway sniper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, making his teammates had to numerically lower play.
Denmark did not exploit this, however, and did not face any major problems with an Illeaeus eleven, which only retreated a little to ‘defense’, except in the last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a great confusion.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flights to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to get away from Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to join the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him ‘in a constructive spirit’, and hoped that he will come with ‘concrete suggestions’.
The President’s visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, to implement measures in view of the extreme rise in diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the Elysee Palace press spokesman David Martinon, the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their business become competitive again, and secure the working conditions and the payment of sailors.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they led in the Morbihan and Calvados protest marches, causing nearly ten kilometers of storm.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited with a lock.
On Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets from early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the sleeve channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cattle did not exit, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible of the National Fisheries Committee that has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.

Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects this year to have 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a danger to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the plane manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider delivering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Currency Authority, draws into consideration more than 15% of its assets to return the $85 billion ahead of it.
AIG is willing to sell a majority of its businesses beyond its international life insurance and pension in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday night to check out possible sales.
No confirmation was achieved at AIG.
Among the assets from which AIG might be separated, its aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and investment in Private Equity, FT explains.
With regard to these sales, no final decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG has to make sales quickly to return the loans over 85 billion that it has granted its federal reserve, including to the risk that the U.S. authorities receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders are lost at the same level.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue banks, a historical case of the courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the most powerful case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded previously on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final shot numbers, the Nasdag Index, mainly relating to technology, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors Index 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected refusal of the Chamber of Parliament’s plan to rescue banks, which would again enable some stability in the markets, the Wall Street, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter, broke down.
With 228 votes against and 205 votes, the members denied the funds he had asked for to do so to Finance Secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture in circulation that represents the Congress as incapable of accepting a plan,” Lindsey Piegza said from FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, and fears that a project accepted in several days will come too late.
“If the project is actually convicted to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, i.e. Red.) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would even more limit the credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, Economic Chief at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency, that every day that runs out brings the ruin of a financial company into the United States.
After Washington Mutual’s failure on Friday, the U.S. authorities plan to purchase the bank transactions of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face not only an American crisis but a global crisis, FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
State cash revenues within ten years have fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday night, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357% on Friday night.
Obama, winner in the first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who came out as a winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for both the Republicans and the Democrats in this television duel, which should be pursued by one-third of American families.
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although very sound, was not ‘brillant’ enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which an opinion survey was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is five points front (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecided voters, i.e. those who are now concerned, Obama emerged with 39% as a winner of the surveys, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his Rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to focus his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, highlighting clearly the ‘naivity’ of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican voting spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself short and accurately, without leaving himself out of the version.
He focused his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has from the United States.
"McCain has not yet understood, but Obama has already," he said this weekend, against a democratic voting spot in which Republicans have been accused of not capturing the complete extent of the crisis on the 'Americans from the street'.
“While the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama lamented yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered during an election event in North Carolina in a flowing rain.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘measurement’ or ‘workers’. ‘The financial crisis, which the Americans consider to be most suitable, gives Obama a clear advantage to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss.
“The next week could be a decisive turning point,” said the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared Obama’s ‘good economic instincts’ with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year-old bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After emphasizing again that he might even make it possible to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, is the highest priority for him.
By 2030, McCain wanted to build a 45-nuclear plant.
The two candidates refrained from the issues taking place on the plan to rescue the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted last night by the Congress and is extremely unpopular for the people.
“Did you notice that a choice took place in Minsk?”
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday night at the main square of the Belarus capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred White russes gathered Sunday evening since the closing of the election sites on the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced yet, numerous young people came to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko’s power: “The dictator should resign.”
Some confess that they have not chosen: ‘What’s the benefit of this if they do with my voice what they want,’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume the negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading White Russian personalities and the ice creation of certain assets, could be removed if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting," said Juri Potemkin, Union press spokesman for democratic forces, a heterogeneous concentration of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is of importance to who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislation proposals.
The opposition is therefore owed to engage in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, goes into a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election course, does not recognize the election as valid.
She emphasizes that the numbers of voting participations appear too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has set the path for any type of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election took place?” asked the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody in the voting places.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, those who are most likely to comply with the government’s ideas.
The silence of the night drops over October Square again.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves for their success.
Discussion - From Blood that Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, was very happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has regained the public's confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the donation service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada in February 1994 initiated a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and developing guidelines to prevent a renewed disaster of this kind.
While Judges Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces at the time set a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood conservations in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this job.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the huge efforts to improve the safety of blood conservations and through work in this field during the following years, we have gained the public’s confidence, she says, before proudly emphasizing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had trust in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, retains awareness that ‘confidence is something extremely fragile’.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, this woman tells, who has been heading since the foundation of 1998.
And we had no mind if this disease could be transferred over the blood.
So we called on one of the main guidelines of Krever and Gélineau's reports, which says that you can apply exclusion measures if you don't know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as it is obviously the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proven that this disease is transferred over the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has a very meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique of detecting HIV appeared on the market: Nucleic Acid Tests (NSTs), which allowed to demonstrate the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case in the tests previously used.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood through our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk of certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize it was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed significantly to reduce the risk of transferring AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means you should distribute 12 million blood conserves before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec spreads between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conservations every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case in which HIV was transferred through a blood conservation occurs.
“I think you can feel comfortable today when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore your health,” said Hema-Quebec director.
“Our challenge for the next 10 years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can enter the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, just like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects over blood.
We have to continuously monitor," Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply along with a safe supply.
“The need increases because the population ages.
Because treatments to combat cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, among which on average only 3% of Quebec’s suitable inhabitants are donated to blood.
Any healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the appropriation criteria can give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and whoever travelled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from blood donation for a year.
With these 3% we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
"Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in donating blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood preserves, but human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye apples and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before being interstocked at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood bank of Quebec’s umbrella cord.
In the navel cord, previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousand umbrella cord blood samples, and we plan to remove more than thousand annually.
“We should probably begin early next year with making it available for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbrella-line blood decrease as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced of not having access to this, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec’s hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the Semi-Final
Montreal’s Impact has become yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and decided on the quarter-final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the total gate ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the USL’s first league.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninety-ninety game minute.
After a first half-time without gate for both the one and the other side, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre- and back-play series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in a suburb of Seattle, had introduced a 2 to 1 downside position.
In the semi-final, Impact will be measured with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate for a 3-1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps went into the half-final round with a total gate ratio of 5-4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3-win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the whole shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel comfortable.”
“He has been too fixed in the first half time,” Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He received stormful appreciation.'
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude to initiate elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new minister of health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's partial election.
"Moving the course of our last major border in the north": This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his speech, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens were spectacular pictures of hydro power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in ‘Google Maps’, maps, etc.
Great money as during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister, by the way, refused to exclude that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his date calendar was very full.
The "North Plan" is the fourth element of a "Vision" that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a "new economic space", which provides an agreement with France on workforce, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it was frequently mentioned in recent times in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th degree - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, restricted himself to explaining why the North was a ‘jewel with huge potential’ but called no date, no investment sums, or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
A few outlook on what could be more worked on: especially on water energy, forest, but especially in the mining sector, promoted by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests’ counting, the North has ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This `area twice as large as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not only close to us, it’s in us,” he emphasized, how to clearly show that he seeks to realize a national founding room.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, after having put in a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s area, includes a part of Labrador with which Quebec has always requested, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments persecuted.
"There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a long time, when the opportunity is offered, I will take this attitude again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change we have to rethink our vision of the north," he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be conducive throughout the year due to ice melting.
With this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the native and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said Quebec’s government would deal with them very carefully, and they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist deputy from Ungava) have already launched discussions in about thirty communities.
A minister committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and soil assets) takes an important place, has taken the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will, moreover, be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
“The Northern Plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if she was a continuation of the liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethink to transform the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the acquisition of the party’s leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions provides for renaming the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about lesage that reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
He referred to the press to another, this time conservative project, namely the ‘Roads to the North’ program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In terms of the project Hydropower Staumamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest emphasizes its launch in operation for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I intend to be there," he relied on his members of the party, which brought about in those conviction storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, actually has the opportunity to hold an election this autumn, which is possible for him from the law, yet not excluded.
He emphasizes, however, that his date calendar is full, especially due to a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the Liberal Head of Party a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitution' objectives, which were adopted without any further: the PLQ especially calls for the recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto regarding the decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition’s guidelines of the North Plan were incorporated with skeptics.
Head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, has recovered the development policy of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced to apply it.
If she had done it, we would be much further today, Mrs. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has voted to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
“But what we want is that this is not just a great idea,” party leader Sébastien Proulx told Mario Dumont, who returns today from the holiday.
Letters - A Dishonorable Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former "justice" minister at the Harper Cabinet was the one who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer she was a "shame" for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unfinished struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do with a government that, as the only one of the countries affected, has not brought home his countryman captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that did not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that he was accused happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the blame of the accused.
Let’s remember that above all UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers’ association are calling for Omar Khadr to get home in order to get a fair trial in Canada.
Precisely this government also closes the eyes before torture: it’s little interested in that a young adult will certainly have been forever mentally broken after so many years of torture.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are just experiencing a deceitful circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries a flag in front of himself, and that sounds so narrative from his mouth.
Therefore, it is time that there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily mishandling, torture and imprisonment a Canadian citizen who is rightly supposed to be supported by a leader of government, who is only supported by the minority until today (should he belong fully to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party preaching the virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed from what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this abandonment, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwell talk of Barrick Gold
In her 17th September issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
He confirms, and pursues a logic of orwell that the world’s largest gold production company sought a blasphemous appeal over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparency debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander charges, but the law.
As expected, this basic difference has been completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to push anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process comes out, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unparalleled weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of gold mines.
The tactics in these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders to force an agreeable regulation that kills the opposite side and also scares everyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is gang and existing in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by cnuble heat.
So it would have been enough if the gold mines had disclosed their books and files and had opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can simultaneously ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very well-concluded view of the term.
In a democracy, blasphemers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in a framework that many perceive as a nebula cladder (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just sent a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they require to no longer use this concept).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s claim is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and truth finding, which are fundamental for every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies in this world, who else can do that then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known to handle debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified claims.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the senior Congress members, Republicans and Democrats have finally agreed on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, must be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: a better control of the Members on the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of homes based on payment residues, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the leading employees of the supported enterprises.
U.S. Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” Bush’s representative Henry Paulson said.
“It’s all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street course crisis,” the Democratic said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do so, the trauma, chaos and trouble in the daily life of Americans will be enormous,” said Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, due to fear of the effect that would have had a renewed failure to the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who only participated late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, however, without expressing their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements to agree, especially those to enable owners to retain their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the executive employees of the state-saved companies.
If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the unresponsibility of certain persons, this is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on American television channels.
When he was asked on another station whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain answered: “I would only like to know the details, but I hope it.
The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we all will have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
“The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the high-risk mortgage loans (subprimes) before it expanded to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAAs), and eventually into a freezing of financial power and into the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican deputies was that failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies in distress are to be secured only by the government and are not to be purchased, one believes to escape the sackle.
In order to round up the views for everyone in the Congress, it has also been added to an arrangement that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it will then be able to raise new taxes in order to retrieve its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a revoted vote by the Congress.
In return for his aid, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that invoke it in the case of profit dividend, and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the removal proceedings regarding the housing bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to fix deadlines for the repayment and debits paid to the executive employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Deputies to vote on it today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is still not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes against this project were raised yesterday, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber’s Financial Commission, his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to ask taxpayers for the cash.”
Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress, called ‘the Caucus of the Skeptics’, represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Forty hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel prize winners, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure, and carefully consider what path to go,” he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we again gave evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis bank group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that she would refrain from buying her competitor in great difficulties since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not a lost money,” said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In order to compensate, we have a voting right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate now because uncertain times are announced.’
During that time, on the other side of the Sleeve Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank brought into trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the UK’s stores and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His delicate sense, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the really terrible monsters.
But what a big continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 of the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his spectacle, certainly even more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and splash dramaturgy conventions.
Mixed blood often gives wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, high quality feature.
Because in it, an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter injured in the Pacific War, studying actor’s art in Yale in the early 50s and then visited the Actor’s studio in New York before he had success in theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for citizens’ rights, was also the driver who became Man’s second’s 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a demonstration relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, even the unknown facets of this mysterious, retaining, engaged, and supersensitive stars disappear towards the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles you will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the most pure sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the movie lovers this weekend to Taumel, while all his major roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than a half-century American movie art in constant change passes over with it.
Then again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
It is called a much shorter remaining memory (1990), which is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have been throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a stubborn and rageful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
He's still.
In his CV, epochs are united.
The youth knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox trainer of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the pater of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who have retired from the movie world early enough, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his wealth, his prick, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to underplay when he judged his very powerful performances.
The Metier wasn’t always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles were only for a long time.
However, he played rare sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or desperate, with their perfect representation he slipped off and reflected his revolt.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drafted a fine women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of fine sense and sadness in 1984.
During the flood of honors that came over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained that his presence has improved my life and this country.
Life pleasure and generosity were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Besides his legendary career, a great defender of citizens’ rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s abdrift, is now going there.
We probably have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinagrette, in sauces, cakes or other foods, and this felt quite tasteless, although we found it still fun at first.
The profits from his revenues nevertheless went into his Children’s Foundation in Notification.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman was committed to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: ''Always and until the end, your Father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honor to pursue the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory by supplement &amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations in the criminal process against Jano’s supplement and his complicits started.
The defendant is particularly accused of participation in organized crime, as well as gross negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal actions, including document falsehood.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds used from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often demonstrated with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from self-government — a total of HUF 65 million — are to be left in part to the cash of the Fiatal Balodal organization, in part to the private cash of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictional invoices have been submitted when receiving the tender funds, and the associations should not have fulfilled their duties either.
According to the accusation, most of the invoices have been counterfeited.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee, to which István Lados was sent by János Supplement.
During this "excursion tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices are intended to have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his complices, András Őri, with the latter being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados’ “exploration tour” was a beer site.
According to two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have hosted the ninety-head group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fitted into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőert, later known as Egüütt a Harmadik Évezredérét, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests have stayed, according to the bill.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in which the accounting documents of the customers Job Jövőert and Hoppá, according to the accusation authority, did not appear.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately knew that it was false documents when the prosecutor’s documents were submitted to him during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly attached to the stamp."
And further: Apart from shape errors, the fact that the company should have housed a hundred people, after they have a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to offer so many people space.
Food was also indicated on the bill, while the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The invoicing counterfeiters have also accepted to verify that the Budapest travel agency taken to their visitors only offers travel abroad, and thus they have stated Hungary travel on the cash-payment bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has been known during the investigations, they have also indicated VAT on the invoices, although travel agencies relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The value of the VAT was totally incorrect to four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Job Jövőert, as the operation is calculated instead of only 25 percent of VAT, in addition to the employees are issued exclusively machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake underwent to the "invoices" was that in a case they had indicated "ware transport" as delivered service, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment advice, the prosecutor said.
Further form errors - false invoicing format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued by Egüütt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were able to be disclosed as fake invoices.
Similarly, in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors claimed to have never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is undermining the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was in dissolution at the time (2001) just when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyptesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass lawyer therefore said they did not have issued the accounts themselves.
Consciously fake
The other group of invoices are people who were aware that they had to place fictional invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Balodal - Ifjú Szocialistak, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued bills for the Egyutt a Harmadik Évezredérét Foundation, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the accusation, the director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, is intended to have also worked with supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is intended to have not provided the Foundation Job Jövőert Alapítvány, as well as the Associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vöörsfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in total value of HUF 5 millions.
However, there was also no payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which, however, had forgotten to notify those concerned in their documents.
The third group of invoices includes persons directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian director of the Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF about 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been buyers of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
Managing director of this company was a Romanian whom Ivan Kubatov should also issue the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Egüütt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have cassesed their counter-value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Mauritians on Ivan Kubatov’s express wish.
None of these companies, however, was active, according to the accused of lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: on request of his companion, attorney Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the addition, such as at Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices in total HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Prosecutor’s Office estimates that Kubatov could have cassessed 10% of the invoice and VAT.
Even Kubatov is supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices have been addressed to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért issued their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (“TMA”).
Both received 500,000 forint, but these amounts have been used foreignly.
In order to do this, they have submitted to the TMA five fictional invoices of the Works Team Kft..
These invoices were guaranteed, by the way, during the investigation of Árpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some accused with a confession of the methods of invoice, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main accused decides to a comprehensive confession of János.
Indeed, his previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report fully about everything several times, his confession still stands out.
Therefore, the question remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the repayment of the majority of the damage incurred in HUF 50 million, and whether the addition is ready in return to take responsibility.
But it is quite possible that the addition now plays the "insulted" after his requests to mitigate detention and house arrests were hit on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage with economic crimes and have not remunered them are at a free foot, or at least under house arrest, the supplement remains denied this possibility.
The psychology of overbiding - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the feil proposed.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basics of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to beat themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were studied using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of striatum, a complex below the brain ridge, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent’s overbidding plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to encourage their thesis, the research group economists have also employed investigations to track money.
In this case, three groups should participate against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, then they made their stakes.
Any other group was also promised $15 reward, in case they emerge as a winner from the game.
The third group received $15 prior to the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis at one was on winning, while at the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing “contra losing” were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or the “winning” group.
“These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
Indeed, the behaviors observed in auctions have so far only been based on the joy of gaining or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we have now parallel a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor at the University of New York’s Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor going to visit?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected are estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are common, however, pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on pathogens, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated foods or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transferred through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, scratch or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to vaccine against the viruses A and B, anyway, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A show about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and breach.
Then the yellowness occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last for up to two-three weeks.
About 1 million people worldwide die annually from those caused by hepatitis B, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every ten people infected in medications treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected don’t even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells – in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check tests, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseased worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already demonstrable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor with the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is recognized to be healed, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th of September is the World Day of Hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by patient conferences worldwide.
The goal of the action is to strengthen the awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early recognition.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research findings demonstrate that religious faith acts as a sort of "pain agents" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it has been investigated to the extent to which the faith in God affects human pain feeling, the British sheet reported "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while studying a painting of God’s Mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off much of the pain.
By means of brain scanning technology, it could even be proven that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which scientists also participate in philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the attempt, a lightning device was attached to the left hand, which delivered the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a sort of religious trance among the believers, while they chose da Vinci's picture because it was hardly different from the other paintings and felt as calming.
The experimental individuals spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “in safety” as if they looked at God’s Mother, and felt “rest and peace.”
During considering the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work before their eyes.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that similar effects could be produced with other strongly acting images, even with the atheists, you should just find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, only remains the question of what effect a Madonna picture Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Maria achieve even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is found in people’s pockets just as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go, and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s managing directors.
Towards scepticians plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he makes it align: These would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and so come closer to the company’s original goal, according to which it wanted to “sort all the information of this world.”
Schmidt stated that after ten years, Google is still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wishes Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are still unable to do so because they weren't known enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered through their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows the visitor to save their own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic are also the so-called "recommendations" that the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in case of data abuse - "When you look at what I am doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more likely to be the potential power represented by the company, which is fearful, and less the sense of guilty or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the desire for the power that reject many Internet users.
It is, however, a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but in case of occasion also transmitted to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, as a result of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also allowed an identification of pedophilia.
However, concerned users could still breathe in May when Google, together with the Citizens’ Rights Organization EFF, successfully brought to court against the FBI: hence, Google cannot be forced to provide information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully issued 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Juvenile Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms, was retroactively removed for two months.)
Google’s Image remains controversial: Those who do not want to issue their personal data because by using Google’s services fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere, the company will beat with the duty of revolt to the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek Culture", which is present in many countries and joins enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require identification codes to its users unlike Microsoft, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program packaging seem to be much more attractive, younger and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks look at the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused particularly in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
“Web 2.0” is nothing but collaboration, that is, users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to be shown publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, these can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of other example cases prove: When looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend will soon find out whom her unfaithful friend has been enjoyed, or the employee will be released because in his blog he just makes too honest to his trouble about corporate management air - one is sure: the term “privacy” has been reintroduced.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he reveals from himself - so, in some cases, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever attempts to keep something secret, or even overcome the Google monopole, can do so - like Scroogle, a tool that, although accesses Google’s search engine, intentionally leaves no traces.
Not a few people intentionally do not register on community pages so they cannot be found, but also Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore not generate the user’s best possible profile.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense’s advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly introduced services prepare not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the Group leadership has completely rejected a protest of the employees after the charges of the company's own kindergarten have been doubled, the management also said that the pleasure of several times of employees would be too expensive or agree, but it was very mild to the knees of the Chinese government in 2006.
The group's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events in the coming months and years could repeat somewhat strongly: while some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project will enable the problem to be completely advised by a system, rather, that the company must soon deal with the Supreme Cour.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the fabric - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwell ways a future in which a person will be nearly frighteningly thanks to data related to Google.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in removing trace
In connection with the dual killing of Ózd, the police have now investigated two young people suspected to have helped in the eradication of traces, spokesman of the police office Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were responsible and they are currently accused of the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, two girls are defending themselves on their foot.
Aid is threatened with a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local resident, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is urgently suspicious of having intentionally murdered several people from money.
During the investigation, the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he drew his creditor on Wednesday to a terrain in Ózd, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the long hand act - this also proves that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime site.
Together with experts, the police now investigate the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange sets purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange stock packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their Stock Exchange.
This is why the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs completely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which however wants to sold more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offers of the Poland include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that from all interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he didn’t even conclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
Financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the increasingly higher international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European leaves already spoke of the "second September 11".
The global financial disaster was due to the US president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president wasn't even able to get his own party for the draft law behind one that should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as the billion-heavy investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a “second September 11.”
Some of the newspapers in Madrid are also located in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now on the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse increasingly, and underneath the entire world will suffer.
While Bush’s plan wasn’t perfect, it now threatens that after the Congress’s vote, Washington doesn’t have any political means for crisis management.
The world economy is dependent on the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations in capitalism’s history takes place.
You can no longer keep the threat out of mind, for example, the Geneva says "day display."
Although some states could still provide their bankrupt money institutions with rescue packages, the banks could save the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going to take place, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states should jump over their shadows and centralize control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna's "Standard" reminds. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are ever more realistic that, after Americans, the European taxpayers will now have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that now is like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "Saviors" should not immediately "bell" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to keep in mind in what case it would be reasonable to capture the money of the taxpayers to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents unless imitating the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired to create new accident avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the type BR23C-controlled biomimetic system, a mini-car, equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
In the flight every bee makes its own, oval "private area" that is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers accelerated the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately runs the process preventing the collision.
The obstacle is registered in second breaking parts, and the motorboot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bee by rotating the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it wasn't, the motorboot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the motorboot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the most inner and vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer that is currently considered to be inevitable within the accidents.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they escape other bees.
And that has to take place in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the evasion cannot be upstairs, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the tires.
While the bees are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or the acceleration and breakdown at the motorboot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store them.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn’t have to save this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it continues to use only a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production in series within the next 10 years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and leading him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages, is prepared to purchase banks’ bad loans.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight, Congress members, after multi-day debates, went through a heavy agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the U.S. House of Deputies, and said that the agreement must be brought on paper.
Both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain – supported the achieved compromise on the rescue package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the result: The program will show effect and it will be efficient, but it has to be done even more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the salvation of Wall Street, but about breaking down the rod of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's time Sunday evening 8am (Middle European time Monday 2pm), but has triggered no high flight on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Parliament votes first on the 2008 draft law to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is on the row.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of securities loaded with loans.
In a first tranche, maximum half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress will vote on Monday as expected, which is to be spent on the purchase of credit charged, poor securities, and over the other 100 billion dollars the President is to decide.
The program is reviewed by a commission owned, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the department's responsible persons, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worried funds, and the companies pay fees for the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary means to provide up to 700 billion dollars as an emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or avoiding a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.”
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now dependent on state aid can hope that their discounts, which are called in the overseas slow "Golden Handshake", will be shortened by the government.
A cut of salaries will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance each helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry is purchasing in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the exhausted banking chief is pushed into the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will aggressively turn on to ensure that manager salaries are not exceeded.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the action.
The state gains participation rights to the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank becomes better.
The bill provides that the President will have to submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers will return their lost money from the financial sector.
On both sides, however, there were skepticians who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers at all, says Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No visa in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chance that the American-Hungarian Visumab come will come into force on January 12, the Foreign Minister said before the representatives of the Hungarian municipality in Chicago.
They believe that everything is now only depending on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced in time to overseas.
She also emphasized that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists should register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is launching negotiations in Washington today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the “Middle Cross with Star” of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts talks with foreign policy advisors of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion heavy rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the financial minister’s resignation.
Congress and government representatives announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they came to an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the removal of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his advantage thanks to the economic topics, while McCains Hoch, which gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was at the same time melted.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly accept the $700 billion heavy package law.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection he has supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 viewers.
He failed to call McCain’s economic visions “old”.
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have difficult to kill (...) but nothing to do is certainly no alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also writes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the deductions for top managers - something he had undergone.
Obama told the CBS that McCain would have played no definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said that the House of Parliament probably will vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking Space
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - thus commented "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian societies have renewed Bavaria for decades - now just the modern citizens turn away from them.
The epoch break is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
Very surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something ended, which, however, had already been drawn pretty exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7% and fell under the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This repeatedly occurred three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is still in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernization operated by the CSU in the federal country has ultimately destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologues had predicted this 40 years ago, but they were significantly estimated at the pace, but without any impact the secularization, the educational results, the rise of eastern and northern Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria to the loyalty of CSU voters could not remain.
Modernization is always accompanied by enlargement of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and voluntary.
It is remarkable that in recent weeks the classic citizen groups expressed the largest distance to CSU: free professions, commercial civilization and voters with abitur such as higher education.
The support of the CSU declined to even below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party Heads retaining in coalition issues" articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the VP.
The OPP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the parties’ chiefs hardly look at their maps.
SPÖ Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is probably very possible - this is already the case in some federal countries and in the social partnership.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OVP chief as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Bowl-Molterer course.
A repeat of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer has reacted carefully to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal concerns of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or going to the coalition is currently entirely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ Chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities began in Paris, which is now directed by the EU Council Presidency country France.
In her speech to the Plenary Party, Lívia Járóka, MEP of the European People’s Party, took attention, in particular to the educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that occurs in Roma’s children, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and citizen protection organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
As Fidesz’s EP members’ press office reported, Járóka pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low levels of education.
“The vast majority of Roma youths have no medium education, and thanks to poor basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree.”
Járóka further emphasized that education is a basic human rights playing a key role in the establishment of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU member states.
According to the Member States, it is important that these relationships become aware of as wide as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student begins the school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and revenue tax they contribute to national expenditures.
"As Union citizens, Roma must be secured the right to high quality education - poor and segregated lessons must be stopped," said Lívia Járóka.
As MEPs explained, a common, target-oriented and action-oriented action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation process in the education sector and to ensure the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“We have to break through the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully righted citizens,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the Summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national levels, for the purpose of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election deback, there are no heads yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were delayed.
Party Chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The destiny of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent vote loss is decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary Party.
However, the duo has already seen that it doesn’t want to stick to their chairs.
In this way, they want to annoy the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" caught personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4% of the votes.
The CSU was a single-register in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern federal country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the parties’ internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Agrar Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the investigation team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-oriented "Free voters" probe talks about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list "Free Voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose anti-Stoiber appearance first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to then serve the targeted politician without mercy.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its strengths on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who until now pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSU called the "bitterest day of his political career" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - he believed that the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and therefore to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on the legs with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who did not make a hell from her disappointment about the fiasko, believes that the CSU’s loss of land will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6%, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0
At the Sunday elections, no opposition member has succeeded in the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies on the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects that there are legal differences in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
De Legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades, yet the counterparty gathered before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who would renew his fourth presidential mandate in the impure elections of the Parliament and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006.
This is why the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycots.
Ukraine is becoming more economically dependent thanks to the rising prices in import of natural gas from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans have been taken, and the country has also selling Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline policy travel, highly agreed to the Russians, and in the background of the expectations of the opposition, hoped the EU to improve its relationship with the belt.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was rather on positive movements rather than on defects – such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's quick report already criticized the campaign on Monday - therefore oppositionists should not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been approximately set at a free foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse the recognition of the independence of the abductive Georgia provinces of South Ossetia and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state for independent month.
“We’ve taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkewitsch told us.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the mighty are afraid of leaving only one oppositionist into parliament."
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for an economic reform to the voters.
"We have struggle with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put stones in the way in sales, but yet I see that increasingly more people support changes, even the older ones," Milinkewitsch said in an argument that even the most supported layer of the pensioners with the Lukashenko regime is the only safety of it.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it’s just a matter of time until the ‘social security’ reminding the silence of a cemetery begins to break down,” Milinkewitsch said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, stated by the news agency Ria Novosti: “People believe in the actions, not the words.” The lack of opposition therefore is a proof of the maturity of the White Russian voters.
Brunetta: "From now it's breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the officers’ entry and exit.
From today, the action will come into force against those smarter, who first stamp and then go on to drink coffee during the working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz-Law” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
“Driving doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher presence rates and more services,” says Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” said Brunetta.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the ministerial presidency.
Masi says, “the choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by everyone, cooperation came from all sides."
So there is no breakfast during the work hours in all now; stop coffee or croissant.
Brunetta advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles."
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announced that “with three months the absence of officials has been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work a year.”
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy.
"their wage dynamics - the Minister - were twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined together to counter the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiling numbers about lower absences at work - writes the consumer center - the people of the 'active faulty' grow continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have joined together to explain the unlawful norms of the decree to war.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will fight for additional financial compensation for labour-related illness; the planned expansion of the sick worker's mandatory home arrest during which check visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's renewables will be disputed.
Napolitano: "Prevention of work accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy, there are 2500 work accidents, three people die and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirmed that the deadly work accidents were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as the result of murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in all provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The concerning data and the tragic news of these days confirm how decisive the issue of prevention at work is," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro).
The Chief of State expresses its “gross appreciation for the constant commitment to job prevention, protection of injured workers, aid to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion.”
“An annoyed ‘basta’ has risen in this way; understandable in tragedies, which, measured by their size, trigger some vertebrae in the media and participation of the public, but the daily reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics.”
Napolitano doesn’t hide that “there is definitely a resource problem too: it needs to be decisively invested in education and information.”
It is particularly important for the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of school frameworks on the part of young people nourishing the labour world.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. It is necessary to put into force and improve a legislative norm.
On the other hand, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini stressed “how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which offenses all of us conscience and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem.”
"The data of work accidents seems to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want that "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
“How to believe that you are not doing anything too much to counter the phenomenon of the accidents, you can struggle against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – but also stronger measures to educate workers who already begin at school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - regarding communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers is asked to face a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also spoke about "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of work accidents" and lamented the "abolition of the social system, against which we have been fighting in recent years."
“The goal is therefore to return a guarantee to the worker insurance so that the destiny of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations that are decided from time to time by a legislator.”
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Hearing sound music over a long period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on EU current and recently identified health risks) in a report spread today in Brussels.
“It is clear that 5-10 percent of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week risk the lasting loss of their hearing.”
“I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume will damage their hearing without knowing it unreversibly,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Of the scientific findings – as it is said by the Eu – it shows a clear risk that presses for fast action.
What really matters is to raise consumers awareness and make this information community.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review again the existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep the step with the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU's communication - confirm that one is too concerned and that the Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, worried about the damage that could result from a large noise load.
These damages can be extremely limited, in which solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure are taken into account.
In its report, the Eu Scientific Committee suggests that when users of portable music devices listen to music only five hours a week (authentic as 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, they apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross music this boundary risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
Thus, 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno, launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it is going to be over in March, it is going to be drawn balance sheet in June.
This is the course set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which the Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno said. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose politically responsible town and municipal council remain.
There is no redistribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
Its task will be completed in March and the Commission will resolve as such a project has to have a timely endpoint.
In June - the mayor announces - we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Whoever questions the Commission's competence as its opinion of liability lacks, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics deal with the daily problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective.”
The mayor of Rome puts a lot of emphasis in precising the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think, it will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to leap a quality – which it really needs – and to make a common step in the future.”
A future, says the mayor of Rome, which will “not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further,” not only regarding the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the First Anti-American President? Here a Declaration
A well-known American politician, who is much considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama became the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy by his decisions and kept relationships with enemy Islam (and that is still doing as a private man today).
The attacks on Obama are becoming increasingly violent, just now when the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very crazy: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators.
In fact, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; it’s racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Also in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: Only in the electoral cabin we will probably know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes the appearance of a US mentality that was hidden until the last.
"Tell what you want, then we'll decide who we'll make our creeks, whether for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now when the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: Which mistakes Bush made during his term? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a hit.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point for the majority of Bush.
The one who will take his job stands in front of a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many accuse the Internet of the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistical about their future.
Nevertheless, they declared not really concerned to those the information concerning the person concerned about general credibility.
You don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come through the cuts that meet the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – as the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from not significantly shrinking.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fulfills the American journalist.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, it is even at 65% among the executives.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web goes.
The main publishing groups are based on the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the print press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to joining the new technology, hoping “it brings something good to journalism.”
The biggest crash is in American journalism today between the newsroom’s chief editors and the reporters working for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are sure, their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
The business managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations and internet operators, employers offer as popular to them and so it becomes a matter of take or leave it.
Chief editors often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros a month, with pension and insurance pay.
As for holidays, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 holidays.
But American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often be “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: LAW IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the Property Maker's request, which had asked him to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of bankrot in the context of the investigation on the counteragreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the late week, his dismissal from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the province to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (to which the prosecutor had pronounced) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and access evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had revealed itself a few days ago when the House of Parliament voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: a large part of Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday’s New York Times issue, which reports how the crisis in the course of the step divides the Republican party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always benefits the government institutions and the business community, and those neo-conservatives, which wins “then in Washington” and the financial world, and faces the South and the South.
This part of the party owes its rise v.a. the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, even throughout the West and perhaps beyond it will be affected by these earthquakes.
In both the states and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-term fearful events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheardful Renaissance of the State in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in bank and financial institutions, which have close connections to the abroad and at the same time manage an immense amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments, namely how it is necessary to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge voter mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone away in itself and lost its speech right: the illusory evidence has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, does not find a common path.
Therefore, all of them now expect the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and v.a. distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became increasingly serious, the U.S. is only to save themselves in the economic situation without foreign aid.
And in addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions not to be overvalued – under certain circumstances – which otherwise probably will not be able to resort to any international organization or market in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is in perfect line with the increasingly important importance that is recently associated in the economy with a closest-related sector: the territoriality.
Paradoxally, it is just now when we were so convinced to have entered a networked overall kingdom, a kingdom of ever-differentiated technologies, of the intangible materials, that at once we must see how our future will still depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are nevertheless connected to an extremely closely written piece of Earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in an unrevenued, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second newness, which, however, requires a short increment.
Who territory, who government, who politics says, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing guides, e.g. those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, a deeper and in a certain sense still disturbing aspect comes: a loss of trust, an indulgence, a picture of inappropriateness, a sense of distantness, all aimed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among many parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their idea world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose wages are the majority of themselves as ever foreign and more overcome.
The demand for leadership therefore undergrounds a powerful yet branched movement of the demolition of the leading class and the conventional political establishment, which is manifested in the unforeseen defeat of the voters' "revolts" (and in the unintermediate movement of the UK's collective atmosphere, beginning with the ascement of the conservative Bay.
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some of them would say their format, increasingly understanding problems and therefore less representative value on what is going on today in the lower social layers of the West and is still increasing and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In the face of all this, it would simply be overwhelmed to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping the eyes far open, however, it is certainly not.
The super sticker that leads to the walls
The powers of gravity to defeat thanks to a glue and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now apparently almost at the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 sqc, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – has an American magazine, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of spaghetti tubes,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have inspired themselves from the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic hairs, which give the animal a perfect stop.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "leaves it remove from the wall without problems," says Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a perpendicular adhesive,” added Liming Dai.
Perhaps, but the researchers are rather thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are equally leaders of heat and electricity.
Further application areas could fall into the area of spacecraft.
So the superheroes have to wait for the moment.
The Other Art of Research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesion.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfiber adhesive that cleans themselves from dust by moving on a surface itself and thereby always preserves a perfect responsibility.
Drugs: Never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness v.a. in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme impact on the body’s receiving them.
David Bailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices in association with drug intake. In the framework of the 236. meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again alarmed: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the capacity of certain vital drug drugs.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
In a report two years ago, the same drug agency had warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, and emphasised to take care of what is being drinked in connection with medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Accordingly, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: “Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers that are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if uncertainties still exist, to have no shame to ask a pharmacist or a doctor,” said the Ansa Agency’s expert.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is awarded by the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the Enron breakdown days, Krugman claimed in a New York Times guide article that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A forecast that was not given little polemics as an answer and was held to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I'm surprised and also shocked about how quickly the reminder of the scandals in the context of Enron or Worldcom collapses disappeared from the public field," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly addressed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package appears
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is released; Open Source Software wins an increasing number of users, both at home and in office, among freelancers and in public administration as a free replacement for Microsoft Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some news: alongside a revised and now Spartan-designed initial menu, the latest compatibility with Apple’s Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format 1.2)
It has also been eight against the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interestingly, some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send e-mail, including the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
It is also possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files that expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most enhanced elements of applications: tables can now be handed-handed by various users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be assigned a fracture to ensure a better corrective process.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final outcome is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following download link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, so it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, if freedom of cost is an incentive for the dissemination of the program into private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: eventually, various public administration agencies and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business outlook.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to extrude Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of known Access; and finally Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand now.
Coal also positively tested and thus the fourth doping fall
It opens a new doping case mi framework of the past Tour de France: it is Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner Team, the third-class and winner of the tricot of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal by the Gerolsteiner Team is the fourth driver positively tested on Cera, the third generation epo, which previously met with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
Analyses from the blood samples of coals belong to those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay Malabry Laboratories.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
Head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and notices, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian respondents.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climber’s suit for himself.
NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the theme of racism in Italy and comes out of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed in Milan a month ago after stolen a package of cookies.
The case testifys of what the Times refers to as "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are those where "most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the largest support of the Northern Lega."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times are called for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants introduced by the Lega is also a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also emphasizes the Pope and the President of State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between Church and State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The student apartment market does not know any crises.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken very serious trains, so many students actually lose their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level,” says Sunia’s responsible Laura Mariani, “in these cities the great demand on the side of students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
Furthermore, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registration, without lease price limits, unauthorized rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that lead to lower rental prices by revising the taxation.
With a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that a sleeping place in the Brianza district of Milan is required for approximately 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the district of Bande Nere) and ends at 800 euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the district of Vittoria.
A sleeping place in Florence costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
The rentals in the neighborhoods around the other universities in Rome are little lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outdoor districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting for foreign European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomalie: a rental that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficial multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what currently happens in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-hall complexes in the periphery, means long-term death for the single-hall cinema in the center. A process that seems not only inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend with a piece of road full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, who gave him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago.
The numbers that the Anec, who provides a central business association, speak clearly: in the last five years, the immense amount of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these teas mostly paid the cinemas in major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifys that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last five years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
“The business has evolved in an irrational way,” says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, “that is useful that new structures also arise, but in the first place is the retention of the already existing, because a hall closes in the city, not all his customers are ready to look for a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old.
And here remains the lack of state for the Commercial Association's background: the debt burden registered by the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not observe existing laws.
To preserve the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year of needs.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fear of the old cinema halls, decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, aimed at protecting and supporting the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the forecast measures, tax departments for the cinema operators and advantages for the public in connection with the near transport: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at more expensive parking fees.
“It’s a pleasant initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align somewhat against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because ultimately today’s audience is more challenging.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I passed the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
Relationships between politics and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of Mayor of Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his vice-president Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who have been arrested this morning for mafia transactions, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who has the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of a compensation amount of 10 million euros for inflicting in criminal associations of the mafia.
“Every type of moral and legal norm disregarding,” the lawyers write, “the two local administrations decided to pay for advisory activities to the attorney Piromalli.”
Thus, it was made possible for the mafia group to penetrate the councils on the official path and to join the policy of public administration.
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loirero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to encounter connections from local administrations and the organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Piromalli Clan, was decovered.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and then also due to alleged links between organized crimes and local administration – the local politicians of their community offices had been unfolded.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the mid-right coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipality council.
He asserted to Vice Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for politically-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the morning arrest order that the Piromalli Clan had even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an audience in connection with the investigations on Dal Torrione, it has shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, which makes public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan.
When the energy emerges from the waves, the great suddenly runs on
It is a non-desiccant source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now this seems to understand the world’s large energy companies.
Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all now look at, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not randomly intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price broke in 1980, the idea of marine energy was destroyed, but now the environmental organisations and the rising oil price pressure to new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy demands could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the flows and tides are still available.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now based on marine energy production.
“Chevron examines these technologies,” says the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us.
This is about the acquisition of an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, e.g. considering that just in Alaska the United States continues to promote oil and that President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also the companies that invest in the new industry; the details are not known, so observers still say an increasing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in the outbreak, not least because the last doubts have not yet been cleared by the environmental protectors.
So far, projects such as that in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, we need technologies with much greater impact on the environment.
There are several ways: Ocean Power uses a system of connected boxes.
The boost of the waves, which moves the boxes up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
It drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plans of this type, which are only waiting for government approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping shop and a park house using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the rotational movement arising.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential customers already waits for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a special interest is now deserving the potential in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are better predictable than wind flows, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more trusted source of electricity.
Especially the tidal energy is that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009, up to 35 million are planned.
