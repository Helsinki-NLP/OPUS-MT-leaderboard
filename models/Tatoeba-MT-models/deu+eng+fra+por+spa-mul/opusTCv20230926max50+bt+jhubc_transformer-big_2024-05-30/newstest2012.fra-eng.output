Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
In the framework of an amendment to criminal law, the Ukrainian parliament refused the draft cancellation of the paragraph on the charges of the opposition head Julia Tymosenko.
In second reading, MEPs refused the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former currently imprisoned Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October for having concluded a priorily disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not definitive and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgment of the regime’s political revenge and has caused a process of suspicion of the court’s partiality also in the west.
The proposal to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As usual in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but are they moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of the Charia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a stealth, the hand is cut off.
Women may forget emancipation, the potential unrespective of their faith are passible of death punishment.
It is the Quran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya it will rule such a order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we wouldn’t surely love it.
But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best, and probably would not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors accepted help with recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated in each attack.
When it comes to seeking the winners in Libya, the West is not part of them.
We have participated in shooting, serving Islam and our hairstyles have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of "cruises".
Without soil occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will eventually be able to boast of an uninterested protection of human rights.
For little to prevent us from these followers of sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the view of investors.
A tornado of the statistics went on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the statements has published GDP-related information for 3As.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries’ statistical offices have earlier published their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France’s 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany better placed than expected (growing 0.3 per cent instead of the expected 0.1 per cent), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the result of stagnation).
The Czech economy has grown 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistics Bureau, it is confirmed that we are targeting towards a progressive decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has grown 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy has grown by 0.5% in the third quarter according to planned and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union has grown 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analytics had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
Spain’s and Italy’s obligations are rising towards critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bonds yields remain below 4% while the situation in the region is worse.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last-instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has expensively defended with a lot of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and much luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure until in the second part due to precise Czech defense.
The vicits of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, in addition to a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were hardly able to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers failed to drill the Czech defense that responded precisely to the long shoots even during the first half-time.
Iran’s students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of possible Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield Tuesday around the Ispahan Nuclear Technology Center where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend the nudity program of their country at risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel has reported a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: doesn't eat breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 years of age have overweight problems, 9% of students have weight above the average, and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again demonstrates how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the models surrounding it.
On the tables of obese children, for example, there is 50% more often than in children's families of normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of small-sized sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolgirls today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents had time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 students from primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesiness is not a chance", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third have joined this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children asked indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-dinner-taste, which is a basic principle of good food," one of the results of the survey says.
Breakfast and dinner breakfast
Specialists draw attention to the fact that for healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at the same time.
In most families everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst one that has been raised is that one tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children are more often consumed unhealthy fries.
Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drinks daily sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children asked do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far, on the plan of a healthy diet, ideal."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
“The most alarming thing is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemons,” it is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place just in front of white meat.
Children didn't want any fertilizers at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Cap on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obesiness is not a chance," we have been based on a determined willingness towards a healthy diet," the results of the survey indicate.
The most significant was, for example, with regard to sweet lemons because children have started giving preference to consumer water.
Children have most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I wondered a little bit that there was a lot from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen later.
The exhibitions of three specialists, the dressing of characters and a seminar on what happens on site.
And it will be worse.
The more we approach final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are lessons on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "drunk."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And such women are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, the other overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically amenuise broad arms, extend a neck, or add necessary curves.
We were able to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too brightly of women like Jennifer Lopez with strong chest and hips pronounced and thin size.
For example, if there is a difference between size and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making it tailored.
And you won't regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides constantly, rolls and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroideries.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am pleased that I have the entire week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that there’s too much about what I have to do at home.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, I am pleased, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who took almost one hundred pounds last time (do not take my statement, please, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Also thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physical but creates productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphist, maintained us all of this.
But this... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialist guests gave a diverse aspect at the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single dress in a different way.
Variability is for this primary example.
Like, for example, this trench coat that must be weared classically with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with escarpins and photograph it as a dress.
Or just lift up the sleeves or necklace and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then begin to counter," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else.
No statements about fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the Ben fashion photographer, the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (which will have a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least a fifteen.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success we have been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made it a world star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists’ services remains still cold.
And known faces sometimes consider them unnecessary (it’s enough I know something but what I seem goes to the second rank).
And if someone is made a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that it dictates us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than it actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on Google and make sure if the news of the boulevard report the celebrity in question, whether it has lean or gross etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to mode and assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dressed and it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to guess people, not flattering, keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new items you can’t throw everything out and tell him, ‘My God, what a horror.”
“You’ll find some things you’ll find beautiful and you’ll advise him with what to wear them,” Mario said.
This showed us concretely what everything must contain called the stylist's "placovka" or bag.
It is the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined such as scissors, rollers for depilation or nursing pins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a clothing is closed on the back, if it is too large or they cannot be grafted kit.
So that we would not just be people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to resemble shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could damage, to fortiori outside.
And so we stick and stick.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so that we did not injure ourselves inadvertently.
Therefore, we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation.
The count I'm talking about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second class weekend
I begin increasingly to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants.
The speed need The Run is fighting throughout America.
Revision
Originally, a problem-free race is transformed because of a number of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do on a routine morning journey at work.
This fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it doesn’t use anything if no one wants to do something else.
The new subtitled The Run part produced great expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be during which the main hero comes out of his car and do what he wants.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we were appealing to.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of a few unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fainting from developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure whose lead hero Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to reach the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then into more than 50 races.
This results in that each race is done on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite well distinguished from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn’t feel at once that the game offers him something the same.
Some environments are quite beautiful even though the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more and more timely approved by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm that significantly decreases visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that a lavender does not fall upon you.
Besides this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a small number, but it is enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (like in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic dual with the chronometer) and then waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time, you also have the police that enters the game and trys to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the passages out of vehicle.
This is rather an interactive entertainment when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you need to help him by taping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is like this because this element does not risk to disrupt and places, in the context described above, in the elements that encourage the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary today, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As for realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although you can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
The problems begin to appear after a while.
In the difference of the driving model, that of the collisions is not yet at the point.
We don’t expect a complicated deformation and collision from this game, but when you don’t have, during a collision with any object, the smallest idea of how your car behaves, so it’s not completely good.
During tight exceeding you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car share in crazy turmoil.
Or he finds himself in mice.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have gone out of the decor the game brings you back at the time of the last point on the route.
But you only have five restarts.
When you have used the 5 reboot you need to start the game again from the beginning.
So it’s more a tool, in the case that something doesn’t happen as needed, something you can truly rely on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the track of route in question.
The big hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that we need to pass in some way, otherwise this doesn’t happen.
Otherwise, you’re meeting in a given place “civil” vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, five seconds in advance or a minute late.
What angers are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the reverse direction and when you arrive, you have to either get away and turn them off or brake them.
It doesn’t matter if you’re going to meet him because it’s “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always happens close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the time of the game, you are coming to some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you to the same place.
This is the most nervous at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at any cost go ahead of you.
When he goes ahead of you, he hides the view of other vehicles in the reverse direction and you collide a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it’s clear that you’re bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have the time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter whether it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of racing is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change your car, however, most of the time that you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for straight roads and exotic sports super cars on highly technical drives, for example on the lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are racing in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (this resembles) where you roll in the dark on the roads (this resembles).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (à priori) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends you the car directly to the ferrail.
In the writing we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragicly.
This especially relates to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imagery is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is available.
In order to please the greatest number and most particularly the young audience, a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I blend everything", but we can expect no one to buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it’s the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it’s not finished.
The fun is really good, but prepare for the mistakes to tap in your eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.
Velour Students in conjunction with Charles University Choers
The Festival Festa Academica offers for the third time celebrations that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.

Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union:
Czechs behave as negativists and euroscepticians
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically eliminated the balance between institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and all players get used to their new role," Miléna Vicenova began his exhibition to the Czech Ambassador Faculty of Law near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relationships so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of Charles University Law Faculty speakers could envy it, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe".
Ms. Vicenova honoured the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent Chairman of the European Council.
“From the beginning, it resonated the criticism that it is fade, that it is a round-of-square, that it cannot fill any mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everyone because it holds its role to perfection.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in a response to the question: "Who is the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards uniformity and greater readability of the Union's policy in relation to states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Ms. Vicenova has also noted the agenda she has lived, lived and lived in a near-term time by the European Council.
She described the Czech Presidency as successful two years ago.
The Czechs solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the governance as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "activity has defeated its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that is still being solved.
In addition, it is necessary to approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and in savings, which branch will have the priority, which countries will be helped most, at least, everything is to be resolved in the future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or tortuous cornichons, differently large bananas or that no one has forbidden us to make syreckys.
She wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Czech Ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspects more than positively.
She is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
It believes that the fault results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech party.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she subsequently emphasized the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, that Frenchman come to me, this Frenchman says, 'Hey, what are you doing there, that this group of Visegrad is still doing?' and he is not at all happy."
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future, new tough rules on budgetary policy are waiting for member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, except at multi-speed, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute for strengthened cooperation."
First of all, it was said that the countries who want it cooperate between themselves and those who do not want it remain in their corner.
"There will be a lot of such institutions and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs. Vicenova said.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes that have an impact on the EU to be debated between all EU members and not only Eurozone members.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocal that expresses the IBM strategy closest, the closest would be "long-term."
For a wide audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was thrown by the company’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little that people are desire to think.
His slogan "PENSE" became the footprint around which the life of a giant future will grow (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM began editing in 1935).
This was the foundation for the company’s culture of care developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that she still remained faithful to her basic values and, however, was not afraid to change everyone else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "for the birthday the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only one of the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform, and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was at the great beginning in discovering talents—as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the mind of the anti-discriminatory strategy as it will be a woman-- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has done what is called jamy, brain storming online from what comes from a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the company there are nearly 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a safe position in the field of business.
"Since the beginning, IBM had a concept rather institutional than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company says itself there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is known in the United States in view of its slogan - it grew up to become one of the largest firms in the world in a hundred years.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, council services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Its discoveries include, for example, the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or diskette.
IBM was this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Overview in advance
It is not all the innovations and manufactures that have had the customer's preference and then - for example, IBM failed to bet on a clean operating system OS/2, Prodige online service or IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance, you can’t emotionally remain hanging on the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
The difference, for example, to the concurrent Microsoft that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a leading place.
In 1990, however, it was the strongest hardware representative with more than the motif of participation.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, over this period she invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspectives technology.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when it first surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Is IBM now going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share prize grew from 2008 as a 120 percent rocket, the company’s net profit continues to grow.
The logo of IBM is to change everything but not its values.
For this one can be expected that this flexible giant will master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheeses to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the ninth century.
They owned technologies such as the former “pushers”, the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Society's Monitoring Board.
Flint hired the leader of a competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then shaded the founder of the firm - it is on Watson’s ideas that so far rely on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu'un firm in 1952.
IBM, as it says its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat tranchers to cash registers.
Over the first four years in which Watson was leading, revenue increased up to $9 million and began the expansion of the company throughout the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the company that after 40 years of leadership, his son occupied the director’s chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its management, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM’s people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos – on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family – the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the Pricewaterhouse Coopers Consulting company and began taking care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is the intelligent build-up of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transportation and city management.
As for the field of IBM trade, IBM developed a "Smart Commerce" platform shortly ago that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also Brno’s strategic outsourcing center.
The Central Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the global level research and development team that takes care of the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her infidel husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a body guardian and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph will wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in Bartosova in her house in summer, she didn't doubt her couple would not stand.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he admitted in public that he loved him.
Over time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and eventually say goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the step of the door of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will take him out.”
“He will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship,” Rychtarova said, showing that she has departed from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm going to stay with Iveta and I'm not going to change."
“My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
“The company continues, I am taking care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy.”
"With Darina we're talking completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
"I know that it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility on myself," Joseph concluded.
Women’s worst defects: Is it concerning you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, everyone, as well as each other, is able to get them out of their sleeve.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of women's vices that can pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Your half makes you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one clothes a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of the balance?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for purchasing.
But you’ll say, which would resist the clothing shops’ lingerie, looking for yourself for nice clothes and then try them all in a cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although most women buy is a hobby, this can become a real hell for man.
Remember just how many times you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big?"
“I would need to fat at least five pounds – I should start doing sports?”
"I like you?"
Do these phrases not remind you of anything?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about its appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Odor and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite run.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaning, cleaning the floors, doing dust, decomposing the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they saw the washing machine, crashed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer just from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, destroy your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sape
"Put this clothes worn in the garbage."
“Do you want to put these old socks again tomorrow?”
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this sap work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It’s obvious that you don’t think of wrong, you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to do so much hard work...
Diffamation, persiffling
Defamation, persiffling and also insults against someone are also the owner of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are pleased to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us lets a little harmless persiffling escape here and there.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persiff, even despise others and are for their surroundings – especially at work in a women’s group – particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia's victory
Hokey attacker Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia’s victory during the NHL game on Caroline’s ice Monday and is again leading the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux's perspective, who has still made an additional pass and has been named the best player in the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told over-Atlantic journalists he had warned Giroux that it would be a big evening.
“I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick.”
"I felt it."
"Some time that feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault from the Czech team.
Voracek fighted behind the Hurricane's goals for the pallet and presented it to the shooter Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer went down, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said.
“I never thought I’d play with a hokeyjist like him at the end of my career.”
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shoot she ends with a difference in a goal.
Matt Read hasn’t removed other complications that end up two against one.
“Pronger made excellent attacks in our area.”
“He taped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the corner far away from the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it," the last goal of the match from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek didn't finish the match with Buffalo he went out in second third party due to a injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand in front of an experienced defender their two-butset advance lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the rear line was sick that especially bothered the local trainer rather than lost points because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's null."
“We played the match only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.”
“But there’s nothing to do, that’s how it’s,” says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For this we had limits, "one of the defenders P. K. Subban added.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender took part in Winnipeg’s thirteenth attack and victory on Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters participated in uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of five lost matches.
How Travel Prices Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially to the socialist bloc countries, because the western trips were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in Eastern Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination to the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (even for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even as part of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he required an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however, it was necessary to do the tail all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition to travel to the west was denied "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovakian currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were many country houses and cottages that the Czechs purchased and this habit lasts until now.
The Czech travel has been a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum, Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the 90s of the last century in neighbouring Western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel long by plane west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to carry with it its own conserved food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that allowed our tourists finally after decades of able to freely buy Western currency.
Our living level as well as average wage increased, which caused another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to an increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have started preparing tours with air charter routes since 1997, which thanks to contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to previously.
In the late 90s of the last century, Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world besides the EU that later facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct airline charters take Czech tourists to far hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to hold fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) for the first time in history, and spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad, including annexed charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but it is likely to end with a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost five months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor, head of the Czech Republic Football Association, is not yet known after a General Assembly to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement in accordance with which rules of vote must be made.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the age after Hasek the football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on September 16 when a new president was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly gathered unnecessaryly at the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not even a matter of dealing with the way of election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only the statutory representatives or the officials who have full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences remain on the election regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
The opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round to not fall into the pat.
"The discording apple lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of candidates who have received the most votes in percentage within the chamber for which he is candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw in order to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of voices of the two chambers.
And the Czech party studies the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely refuse the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which comprises the objections of the residential party and according to which it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the election settlement established in accordance with the most Pelta statutes benefits among all candidates.
"I hope that we vote at the maximum in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"So that there are no saugreeous ideas yet imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen owner who is candidate for the first time and who in his exhibitions mostly defined himself against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new President and believes candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive manner.
“The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone.”
"Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there is more strength for cooperation," added Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in both professional and regional football leadership.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
“This is not a problem between the Czech and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change drawing regulations.”
"This can again cause a blockade at the General Assembly."
"I hope the healthy reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement with all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say whether the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially afraid flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had to travel to Podgorice, among others, did not depart for technical reasons and were looking for a variant to take part of the Executive Committee on the field of retaliation.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the shaken parties within the country’s strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are a lot: a state endorsement, the credibility of football and also the Czech Sports Union General Assembly that must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to the fight for the position of President because he sees no candidates correctly.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic Football Association (AFRT), he would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I struggle for him and I don't present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would be given a priori favorite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that in the event he won the elections he would only hold this position as President until the year 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I’ve talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a counterfeit man who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta takes this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What still shocked is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during listening in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went out without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik would triumph on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September who had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go with."
"He has great capabilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he pronounced for the cancellation of the Arbitrary Commission with Ludek Macela that Dagmar Damkova replaced.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and he also led the Plzen club since last year, who, with his support in May last year, celebrated his first division triumph.
“I have the strength to make something change in the sports world and bring some culture to it.”
“I would break the influence of some interested groups that, for example, have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, leading to situations of bad taste,” added Paclik who doesn’t shake his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relationships with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power of lobby with high-level policies would achieve more money on gambling tax for sports.
“This is one of the key points the new President should take care of.”
“If it’s the gambling tax as political parties declare, I understand their arguments but they should also say where money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be “above the parties.”
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
“I don’t see any reason to transmit my actions from Plzen club to someone if I have to return a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the disputes regarding the election settlement.
Jablonec’s official is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that the successful football performance today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta prior to the September election which did not accomplish, promised to devote himself to national representation and the obtaining of financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly, and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the management of football and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association,” he added, but he’s primarily linked to the Jablonec club, who has worked a large number of years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experiences to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is an euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly of June Statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there had not been all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took full attention to the delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as a personal mission and I'm ready to take all responsibilities in case that doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he strives, said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his training in law and knows that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, which on the contrary doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
“He has evolved in football for a year and has already had a few successes.”
“His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"This is also why some now have doubts about her character," Pelta told her opponent, but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions from the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a football winter.
"And I would also strive to finish all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the subsequent corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," CTK told Czech Press Agency on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not lead to any changes in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where a comprehensible nervousness reigns since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios scheduled with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of dispute about how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there’s a new leader in his head,” Pelta says in an optimistic way two days before the day probably decisive for her official career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, it would not like a lot of people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event he was elected we will begin to work hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relationships with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of the entire football."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a high-performance youth football."
"But I don't say I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
“I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will take care of a specific field.”
"And I'll distribute difficult missions for football to face a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it's going to start working hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not represent himself as a candidate due to a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I'm working 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and issue doubts about each of my actions,” he explained why he was hesitant.
"A lot of people have said to me that I shouldn't give up because they would give up too."
"This is a confidence I can't betray," he said.
What motivates it, they said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“Since the last two years there has been a great job in fact and I don’t want to let him go.”
“There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them,” he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta’s election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
“Behind him there are people who fair football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen.”
“I can be blamed a number of things but surely not to bear what one.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen.
And he once again confirms that he would only be a president for Czech Republic.
"And if there are some who say the opposite, I'm ready to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other morave whose winners would be in the first division."
“There would be no situation like currently with only three morave teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
Like Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel support from the Czech Chamber who elected me his Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who considers among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiations with television and gambling law.
He says, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to all.
While he says about Pelta “that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility,” he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
“Nobody can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to destroy his successes," Rajchl said, who evaluated his rivals.

When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an item that should not be missed in his luggage: his bath suit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged couples, and swimming against the Putten marbles who awaited her on the other side of the pool and missed to admire the meticulously restored New Art from these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool was pleased to her, she noticed in her book without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain). The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervent bath culture.
Meder, explain that she doesn't have much interest in sport but feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimming supporters have to just contemplate blue tiles and moderate themselves with the Javel water spray while joggers breathe with a fragrance enveloped from spice forests or can listen to the park's happy bird's sweetness.
“I asked myself one day why the swimming pools should actually always be so lazy,” the Vienna said.
“I started a collection of beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
A diving in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other side, however, reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically shown in a double way: high vaults, multi-colored tiles, tremplins.
The small-format "Badefreuden" image volume makes a worthy 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes it desire to make a jump in the blue.
Collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose basins are filled with bottled water containing the alkaline and thermal in Jázber.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the bath of Zurich is at the eyes of the entire city, you can admire the Arlberg snowy from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which the ski anima can be observed.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains from the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel water does not come from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths come from a smell of sulphur, from the Arpad-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba comes from a strong oil smell, which is difficult to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon sticks you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also experienced disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatchowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barried land.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
Taking a look at the window of the New-Art building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of herbs between the tiles.
It observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The thermal palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; it is not only possible to discover neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra style mature room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite swimming pool expert Iris Meder - not only because it is originating in Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a beautiful efficiency to melt construction styles so different in such a wonderful unit,” said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines raw material speculation in detail
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up speculation on raw materials?
According to the SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has tasked a working group to search for the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group then wants to get the consequences of it.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials raises prices upwards and that banks share a complicity to global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aligned with the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The raw material speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts share the opinion that the beters have removed from the offers and asked - and benefit from the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently from American competitors: he promised to investigate the reproach and says, "No matter is worth putting at stake the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to the SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be shot.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann Build His Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly dramatic manner how today’s banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank’s reputation is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he doesn't have to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would resiliate investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November carried out questionnaires with 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank’s customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all the investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 percent would not advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% said they would think about the termination of their account to change their bank institution.
21st house in Vienna
The flag that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with highs, bass and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell in ruin.
Now it is again open and takes place as an exhibition house.
If an enthusiasm for modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its bright, bold, and new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer's flag for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the Grand Prix of Architecture for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Garden Switzerland at the Southern Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly unleashed.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, now he bears the name of "Maison of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky hit at any point of view.
The new start was conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco has promoted a historician of art to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skateboarder, subsequently at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, led to the well-established work of transformation among politicians and the protection of monuments, and gained funds in public.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, there is a coffee and a bookshop, and there is a office to be built.
Strict surveillance, small budget
For the realization, Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important" place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness as a result of his movement to Vienna and his change in use.
In the current transformations there were big problems: the building was “a energy buffer,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass facades were changed, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was laid and the roof was replaced by a particular safety glass.
Thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two ground floors have made space for the new operation, a light panel sealed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but always the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original outdoor doors remained, the house is painted in a tint protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was once.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
“Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and that also enjoy the office of protection monuments,” says Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a raw ground underground.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
This would have been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and despite all it wants to "wake up the right consciousness."
But in this case the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is just the newly planned "quarter of the central railway station", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another lucky hit will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Center, and as it says, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional this year.
The newspaper Bild-Zeitung previously reported invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that a total of approximately €300 million would be expected to invest until 2015.
This should enable improved availability of vehicles and the rail network as well in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowfall of railway facilities and rails should double and increase to 16,000 people.
The objective is to get rid of snow and ice shells until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the road equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Station Head Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter, the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks, among others, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Ministry of Railroads.
In addition, there is a delay in delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing for years, since it has to check ICE train axles significantly more often at the workshop, after a rupture of axles took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
Germany’s Deutsche Bank paid millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of chief Josef Ackermann, there is something new in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine to millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank’s problems weren’t already enough, the past of this industry giant came up with it in addition to the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in comparison to $106 million to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothecal documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA brings large banks a number of accusations, and that they have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and driven banks downwards.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution on this issue, without the parties starting proceedings in the court," an interlocutor at Deutsche Bank in New York said.
In comparison, the Bank has not recognized any fault.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and is involved in bankruptcy, to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by billion dollars.
Comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took on other large banks in part and in summer he assigned before the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As for the question of hypothecal documents, it is about "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, it currently blows a storm wind on U.S. banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have attempted numerous remedies to obtain repair or sanction offences.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She reproached 18 large international banks, both U.S. state real estate financials Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having "promoted in nature in hypothecal businesses of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also file a recourse to the FHFA, with several transactions of a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but not citing a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and declared to wish to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases IBM by 10 billion
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s TI company.
Since March, he has purchased stocks for a value of more than $10 billion.
Up until then, the large American investor Warren Buffett explains that it doesn’t constantly invest in IT companies, since the long-term development of companies only makes it appear bad forecasts.
However, he read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, IBM TI activity grants itself the right to now call itself "Mr. IBM".
Car Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic show that he has purchased IBM stocks worth $10.7 billion since March.
Her investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had guaranteed reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been investing on profitable IT services for some time as the operation of accounting centers.
The IT pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in the businesses he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett rather attacks the rail break, lubricants or machine manufacturers.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares from a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former München München Rück.
This 81-year-old had regained the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a worship figure for many investors from around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money gave him the surname of "Omaha's Oracle".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a total stock value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell," the Turkish media doubt German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek business in the 2000s to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the spectrum that had been thought to be dead for a long time has reappeared: since Mölln’s incendiary attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no more comparable violence with this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
If there is xenophobia in Germany, it has never been questioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "This was the title of the online publication of Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand stressed that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is worried that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourbier.
It was reasonably reacted by the Turkish community in Germany: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration to victims of racial violence in front of the gate of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politics had thought of a ceremony for the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with happy colours that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a strike: “Germany’s gift for the fifty-year-old anniversary” is the title of an article on the Turkish platform “Haber X”, which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive it from getting univocal conditions.
This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He points out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and contributed significantly to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The action of the police was very critically perceived on German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it hasn't come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in some suspected extreme-right environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least retorical or even drastic means: "If the affair continues to be overwhelmed, migrants will remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
“Inner peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,” Selen writes.
What this means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, Mölln and Solingen attacks in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has clearer shown to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Formerly it was above all the failure of German politics after the attacks complained by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and reassessment of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandalous Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous Bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and skate between times from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was known in July that he would occupy a position almost as spectacular in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the UBS Great Swiss Bank - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly greeted, greeted Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained strength and made nice observations on future colleagues.
"The UBS succeeded in the turnaround."
“I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
As of September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
An UBS securities merchant in London had diverted all the Bank’s security systems and flamed around €1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered a suffering person - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a bank, much more teacher of economy and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
Only suddenly he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, doesn’t spare the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rude, had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
It made impression.
Former bankier Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich tells: “I have always taken UBS as a good bank model before my students.”
"In the current optics, we wonder: how could I just have been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something didn’t turn round at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was until now considered a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later we felt why he left.
The division of the bank had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this, she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and a Arab state background, which was passed in silence, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
But it was only the first shot.
In April 2008, it became worse.
The bank was expected to announce once again losses in billions, chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland’s second best-paid board in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis prior to bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State, given its investment mistakes.
The national bank bought tens of billions of issue securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billions of francs for convertible bonds into stocks, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to protect from such big banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
A few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared ready to publish customer data easily, which perhaps had frauded the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, UBS has more or less published that it had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestigious discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
He followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in both main business sectors: bank investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as one thought, that the UBS would get out of it, he followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flambear merchants of €1.7 billion, before the bank noticed that something wasn’t round.
And it is published: with risk management in investment banks it still doesn’t seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we found that risk control has changed too little,” said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
Therefore, the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long taken their role, that of becoming a guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of inherent reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich is still going together with the private Swiss bank's solid cliché - it's just a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's are found here among the Swiss tradition stores just like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Crédit Suisse Palace to private electoral banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance hall by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are coated with marble, in front of thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other out of the market - or betrays the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, ultimately like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, it finds it - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have widespread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon mouths."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it gained high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On Wednesday, the little country’s government coalition with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation’s history,” wrote author Lukas Hüß in his book “The Crash of the UBS.”
With up to 68 billion francs, or €45 billion, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks together concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has constantly recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with a strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorest, but although already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 UBS Group Head, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well in patterns and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has paved a path to the top with the learning of the bank.”
But Ospel would have trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli probably would eventually have made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Perhaps tragic.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meeting of leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word of order: detron Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of currencies and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisors, who had the responsibility, stressed a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. hypothecal products.
To fill this gap, UBS started an adventure, which almost cost her life.
Thirsty of growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed value documents based on U.S. mortgage loans - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
“Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was in flame, the UBS bought there,” said Geiger, the banking expert.
The more euphoria the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved to be harder than we thought.
UBS posts have become ejectable and are so far banks.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration in property management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophize vigorously, as much as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was committed: he must conduct the UBS affairs sustainablely, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He said publicly only that he was going to pick up with his wife an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart horns spread into cities
In many places, frogs are considered "birds' problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have long no longer been allowed to hunt out of cities.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The horns belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "birds' problem" is not yet in view.
During the first Ostfriesisch symposium on the horns, experts said it is no longer possible to hunt the frogs of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors were based on the problems of cities as well on the exodus of the particularly protected freaks: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, designing and killing typical coastal trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 coastal pairs in the westfälische Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative advertising due to the massacre of horns in the region.
Criticians found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal goats.
"The normal expulsion, the expulsion, is not worth anything," said Leer's landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using water under pressure or killing trees often produces unwanted consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
“Animals go away, large colonies split and they scatter to other places.”
Evincement is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement houses or schools.
“We find ourselves forced to live with them, we cannot exterminate them anymore.”
The problem is not resolved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal removal with aversive packaging and attractive offers, to allow them to reinstall elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens looked at "info panels instead of sections" to establish completely different relationships with the ones: "We can ultimately better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-trailing-educational basket in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing the lives of these very intelligent frogs.
This project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a large number of communications, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The frost people do not only use instruments of work to reach a regal but they themselves make their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists from the University of Cambridge recently tested four frogs, how much the intelligence of the birds arrives.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a shaft with stones to achieve a larve.
Without a lot of training, they certainly recognized that a stone should have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the intelligent horns then had to solve a more trapped problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small shell with a larve.
The birds could not reach their bullying with their bell.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All the four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small pipe seal.
Three of the four things have succeeded even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup of Bosnians and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland purchased the latest tickets from the 2012 European Championships in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal missed against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the Eliminatory Return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first sleeve (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in the 0:0 zero match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) rest against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) marked the other tires for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a 11-metre hand-played penalty (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) did twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup eliminatory in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-meter free shot in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed its remote shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not accomplish anything in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
Former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33e).
Jiracek shoot a goal for Czech Republic
Finally, Ergolding’s arbitrator Wolfgang Stark at the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a controversial 11-meter penalty played by hand after a Fabio Coentrao action that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the vice champion of Europe in 2004 succeeded in four strikes and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion goes to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface just next to the Cech shoot.
After the break, the cruise had to come to help the Czech world class guard already shot, again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end ultimately clarified everything.
Turkey was missing Zagreb’s football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his place on the third bank of 2002, the Croatians were able to rejoice for their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost seen a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan marked at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croatians left nothing burning.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic from Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already supported with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32th Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalised for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23th minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first right opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia’s defense could prevent a possible goal of the first shooter.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goal guard Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and cracked the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott told customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this fast-expanding country.
China’s growth plans are also an important element of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenues by 2015 to €20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded a revenue of almost €12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, who employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass killing
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity, entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sadness: An Intimate History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that hold your heart.
One tip to start: carefully torn this page and make your papermark.
In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fountains of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here an out of common book that he describes, accurately, as "an anti-history work."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials are found.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a book describing what it could look like. There are the “sentiments, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to escalators, through physicians, ambulants and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some will lose members, become crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives are empty here as a church’s shelter: while some are turning off, new ones are rallied.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
It brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is summarized only by the terrible war of the tranchees on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under rocks; one Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the Tse-Tse flights are an untreated problem.
This book is exciting from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a Katrina hurricane that pushes the cordite.
When canon shots sound away, and you are a home mother, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sadness" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German High Sea Float.
Their stories are primarily drawn from memories, letters and other already published documents.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach deprivation and ability to get out of it.
By telling the story of a German school girl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wood buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "bead made of cooked rice crushed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake bone of wood); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden foot soles."
He stated that "837 authorized substitute meat are registered in sausage production, and 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own push towards wildlife and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were intended for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky at hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a vernis is synonymous with your behind, and civilization.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he risks heavily to die, and that no one will not notice or pay attention to it.
“When we are registered to sacrifice, we hope to have a public,” he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man secretly strangled."
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the early century: the well articulated mass murderer and convinced ideologically, in well cut clothes, who runs his slaughterhouse while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who at all costs tried to catch a venerous disease in prostitutes to avoid front service.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of finishing the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captured the way the war “deleted exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion.”
People start wondering why their leaders are making them a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new," by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund’s work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most stunning I have read in a non-fictional work.
I'm not gonna reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, entered your hands this page where the list of people is listed and burned with a lighter.
After a first fault, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing anti-riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the empty one.
The operation remained secret to all other than a few senior officers and others informed from the beginning that they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be any repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the settlement of the department and caused a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police were prepared by observing the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers get better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist of moving quickly a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session took place Monday night, on Manhattan side of East River.
The orders given to move through the park have reached "at the last minute," said an accustomed, referring to the operation as "a mere exercise".
"The few police officers I know and have been called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," the person said in anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city was able to retain a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police officers wanted to clean the park, but repelled by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from the whole neighborhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people went and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was an appropriate timetable.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least people," he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages of speakers sounding seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue wind cut, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was hit before 1h45, the police said, leaving the occupants time to gather their business.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Head of the Police Department, said that this measure had been taken only by security.
But, according to many journalists, police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, rudely held by officers.
Browne said that television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture pictures.
While the police moved west through the thick demonstrators' business scanning, including luggage, plastic grass and leaf bags filled with clothing, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning everything occupants left behind them.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were drawn, and the images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About a dozen people at the epicenter of the camp were hanging together.
Finally, two people were chained with trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended approximately an hour and fourth later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "trouble to public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most graduated officer to have found on site.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "is not running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a house slope north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw police expanding the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people to get them away.
Nearly 28 people were on the northern side.
One of the most vibrant actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on a police car's hood and others were seen cracking the tires of a police truck.
At some point, a piece of counterplate came up flying from the crowd.
A police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
School aid union continues the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month, plans to conduct a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate gun of the union, the 37th District Council, to attempt to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aids, parents coordinators and other employees, among the least paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7 last. The union leaders compared these dismissals with a political revenge for not leaving the city access to a health care background led by workers groups, and which would have allowed to close the last budget.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing of the municipal council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that disclaimers of school aid were not specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers said they would fill a complaint, warning the education department that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce prosecution at the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
Dennis Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant, and complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city’s legal department, said that the municipality has not yet seen the reasons for the trial and cannot therefore comment on the allegations.
According to the New York Times complaints, the union would put on the number of dismissals in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose most aid due to regular underfinancing.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and a few barely in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in Brownsville 23th District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid employees at Harlem’s 36 public school, where 68% of school students live in poverty, prosecutions say that “This is not a neighborhood of seamless parents that can bring funds to fill budget lack.”
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also states that high school directors could have been mistaken by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memo used the term "depth" to describe the action, although "depth" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "66 parents coordinators have been dismissed," and "not only because of excess."
Mission Completed: Congress agrees on the issue of Libya
It would eventually seem that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Lybia.
A successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will need to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and U.S. troops for their court.
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to reconstruct their country," Kerry said.
“This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, legislators of the two parties entered conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at endorsing or not the US military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow limited U.S. military employment in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the bill’s failure, the House of Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary
The U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory – the Congress was sufficiently disturbed to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not sufficient to cut the grass under its foot.
The Congress's indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO’s mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the U.S. national interest in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new action gain all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission, or will it divide legislators as last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not read the latest version of the new project yet.
Within the Capitol, the House has to vote this week for an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congress Republicans, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to the Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the amendment for a balanced budget only, and another handful that would "control federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are the same, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to give their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) adopted last August requested the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democratic New York) wishes to lift the limit of two terms for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments to guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is constantly proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states are opposed to it.
As long as the members have been eager to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed down compared to the early 1990s, when members usually proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona) appeared Monday night in a TV show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wants to recover instead of returning to Congress.
When she appeared to the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the ball that broke his skull and broke the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During her first television interview since the January shooting, who killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and singed – and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords answered "Full well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The special show traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting of 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a broad scar on his front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband’s encouragements.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, “What.”
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whipped another word ("Toast") to ask for the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped her and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and heavily treated while waiting for the trial.
"There have been a lot of dead," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
At her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, restore yourself and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for troops
The event: A Wall Street gala to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in cravate clothes stood at his feet to praise him.
“Military men and women are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraising.
A senior military degree in the gala, to which Admiral Mike Mullen, head of the US Army, also participated, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a sort of orphan," the military lead wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizators had good intentions.
I know.
But that wasn't respect, just compassion.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and an American public passionate but often distant.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, a few military officials say.
The audience acts increasingly as if it was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland said, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave to Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way to support us is to enclose us in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to far-reaching areas.
Others would wonder whether "an angry and violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who fighted in Iraq and returned to work to the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made his interviews subtly asked if he would be able to hold the shot under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you approach the topic of service, you are confronted with negative impressions,” recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the army that sees little direct advantages from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said Lieutenant-Retirred General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and people focus widely on the depth of the suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of endured services periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure of rape against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for supposed inaccusation of rape.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
1st class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her headquarters at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has left her concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught him behind, thrown down and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will be anxiously waiting for the judgment in a historical trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rape within the army, thus contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Rated in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by colleagues of soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares to take care of the gallonned military, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecution.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will attempt several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
Judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, referred to as Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to fight, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan, women’s soldiers teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
Results: In these two wars, 150 women soldiers died – two-thirds in battle situation.
It's time for the army to modernize, declares Susan Burke.
She is not alone conducting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale’s Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Center prepares a case against the four major military academies for supposedly encouraging a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality troubles" attributed to the victims of rape to leave them - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a group for men's.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with claims for benefits for people declaring that they were victims of sexual assault in service.
Nine bills independent of each other were presented to the Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded based on the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents occurring that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the army were tried - half the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The complainants of Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first ones in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she reports the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge, in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier the day of her aggression.
Six people have witnessed as witnesses of morality for the criminal, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was issued," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember told my commander, 'This was not his trial, but mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult with a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder, making her inadequate to service.
In January 2010, she was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any advantage.
Whether the Lyman and other complainants will advance or not, this is a long history, says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington’s Faculty of Law.
However, he says, “I think they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The chances are heavily against them...but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things only change when good people have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in favour of them, the complainant lawyer Susan Burke will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform,” she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his online anti-immigration opinions.
On Monday, Breivik, who recognized that he was taken of a killer madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking with a few million nationalists who support the extreme-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wish to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't so difficult to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS thinking group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way merchants have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer an investigation. The questions asked were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and optimism as to their own.
By entering into contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and her colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“This is a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I Love", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three contents per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose website name appears in the title of nearly 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s advantage lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach in the street.
“Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter,” says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunk-state exploits had greatly more likely to be alcoholic than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests student colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would speak too often about alcohol.
"You can't address a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behaviour and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook is also constantly accessing user information.
The site’s data-care team studied statistics about the in love situation and Valentine’s day, the rate of participation in the 2010 middle-mandat elections, and a national happiness index (due to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard about?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
“I don’t believe that a large number of users have already thought about a researcher being able to study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by watching his students’ Facebook walls.
"As long as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks a notebook and a pen remain the best tools you can use.
“Nothing will be able to replace the real world and contact with people,” he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" at his first appearance at the trial held in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he explains in front of a 500-person hearing room.
"In terms of the jurisdiction of the court, I refuse it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts, but I don't complain guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he “wanted not to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions.”
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, to talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for twelve more weeks, forbid him to talk to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
About thirty parents of survivors and victims were present in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally went a little advanced after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed with a dark suit and a blue cravat, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, watching journalists and survivors in the eyes while entering and exiting the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy and also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with complices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which perhaps will comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred that he looks like a monster, but that's not the case," a parent of a victim said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview in cinema this week
After Steve Jobs' death last October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself by the technical engineering and modern computer inventor.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational enhancement - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "sickness exception leaving them to think that a great idea makes 90% of work... [but] a lot of manual work separate.
In 1995, Bob Cringly developed the "Triumph of the Nerds" television series. This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringly is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
Only after Steve Jobs' death a full video is found in the director's garage.
This slightly upgraded video is the basis of the 68-minute movie titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released at the cinema on Wednesday and next Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
From four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of thought, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
It also discovers moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurge, where he seems to be looking forward to hearing Crinley’s questions, giving him elbow hits to accelerate him and move to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely pre-conscious aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computers.
It’s one thing to read Steve Jobs’ posthumous career assessments, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer at the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then puts them in place.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
About how he learned to run a business:
“During all these years, I have always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do it.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to give details about his efforts to simplify Apple accounting.
Perplex about how costs were recorded - often started with a “standard cost” assessed at nose view, then adjusted with a “variation” - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
About the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to hack the phone networks and call for free on long-distance.
The camera has been the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his Blue Box description as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another while surrounding as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you shouted in the public phone and it came to you a minute later at the public phone next door,” Jobs explains laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn't know much, but we knew to invent a little thing capable of controlling great things. This was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would one day have existed without that.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak developed: he called to the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by getting Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two complices laugh in crazy just before the Pope himself was awakened.
About his love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's demarcation):
At the age of 12, when he hunted spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop computer never designed.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small Cathodic tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a headshot.
At the beginning of his career, as he settled to sell a few printed circuit cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was crying on them claiming that I would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved to be incredibly reliable.
About large companies that breathe:
A long time before he resurrected Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Do you admit that you were working at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copier or better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopoly, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are these types of people] who end up leading businesses and product staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely ruined by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have held the entire computer industry.
She could have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They destroyed the defeat from the victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot of his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories, too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are taken by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso one day said the good artists copy and the great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If it was not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health law as the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court gathered in closed doors to examine the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm to defend the case in front of the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was a trial by 26 states contesting the reform of ambitious health care voted last year by the Congress, a law that was a rallying point for national conservative activists.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March next, and the result will probably be of nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be rising at the time the court’s decision will be made.
The lawyer who stands in front of the court and will argue about the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a general applicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s legal firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that disputed the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
He was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican top of the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct governing the actions of the federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge can attend collections of funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a stakeholder, an honor guest, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
“The judges were drinking and dining and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court.”
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds from this event removes any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming they are too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general appellant for the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refrain from hearing the case, saying she had invested too much in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indications that she would do it.
Boeing Records $18 Billion Order for Line Aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way aircraft, with the ability to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reached the record sum of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
The Chicago airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the most expensive order of commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
The Emirates airline based in Dubai has passed this Pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Salon that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, called Dreamliners, a model that flats with significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
“These customers in particular have a huge value.”
In the Middle East, oil producing countries own a lot of their airlines.
Therefore, they have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the fuel price – usually harmful to airlines as it represents their largest costs – would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price rises, Dihora said.
“They have a natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s predominance on the market of large carrier aircraft and helps break the attempt to enter the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft salon arrives four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the starts of the largest version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus removes its debuts to increase its push as a result of its customers’ demand to increase its charging capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to reach $67.94.
Mexican President’s sister clearly beaten at the Michoacan election
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped his PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race in the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán's governor during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was head of the race at the position of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the entire voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview on Monday following the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they seized urns, set up road dams... and forced people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until he lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have been distinguished only by little of Calderon, who was in the head of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a Conservative Party candidate of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, currently held governor, came to the third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential defeats for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
It is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered as he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally from the campaign because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections are, a victory will help the party in its boost.
The man we expect to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of BASD based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He did not advise the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the challenges of Europe with an “indifferent eye” and reported that Asian financial support alongside European leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
"Anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is therefore useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point, but it is not protected."
“So if China and India can help, nothing will prevent them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian borrowing has been dangerously risen and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has brought out the fear that the global economy will become a recession, and has caused the call of the main emerging economies to gather to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag assumed that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the obligations of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiation power to Asian partners in Europe.
Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, Anand Sharma, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the euro area given that its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
“That’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 per day, or even less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on sun holidays and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, Chairman of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that cause losses, such as in the railway sector.
Nag said the crisis in the eurozone could lead to "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “risks of loss” due to the European threat.
He reported that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “relief plans” to protect themselves from economic turning and significant leaks of capital.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raised the pressure on Congress Monday, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would overthrow national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from Pentagon’s corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digest $450 billion in discounts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more compression is imminent if the Congress fails to achieve a spending agreement.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta told Senator John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina in a letter.
He said that the failure of Congress to achieve a budget agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our vessels and our construction projects inexecutable – you cannot buy three-quarters of a vessel or building – and seriously harm the other modernization efforts,” wrote Panetta to the senators.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on wageless leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
“Although wartime financing for contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
“Wage managers would be reduced, causing delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an uncontested world leader of military power."
"We are heavily opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a common statement Monday afternoon on the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence we can live with, and it is certainly not the consequence we should impose ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he has reached the highest post of the Pentagon cumulating years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of caserns, buildings and bombs that have not enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in her preliminary comments at the Pentagon.
“It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents.”
"In fact, she invites to aggression."
In an add-on to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: crisis, conflict and disaster response time; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could move to the cutter, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal fighting vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A look at the recent headlines indicates how deception and lie are omnipresent in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is engaged in exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State officials have been accused of spoke for allegedly covered reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Anthony Weiner, a member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet, became an idiot by quickly emitting denies that were contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of financing campaigns related to coverage of an extraconjugal link.
And then, none of the one who lived the story will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The deceit stories at school and university tests are legion.
There were cases where teachers gave the test responses to students in order to be seen well on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lie and deceit are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of them are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a charades-like society game where the goal is to scream: "I have you," detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a deep research of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lie have been demystificed.
The liars look at you in your eyes.
They don’t beat, redhead, or don’t always shake.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to discover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question, and the answer time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging knowledge of deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skills that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled to read others well, make them comfortable, manage their own emotions and intuitively detect how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but lies they tell to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if someone lies?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establish the data."
This helps provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly in order not to launch unjust charges when you see him moving his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceitful people can immobilize the top of their body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, look to an outlet, significantly change their posture, or present a relief from "post-interview" - an exaggerated breath of relief, a change of posture when all difficult issues are passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson destroyed using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The misleading individuals may also use a distant language: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be disrupted after the threat of late U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - raising the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to bring it back to the rails.
TransCanada said Monday night she will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This resulted in the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new potential route studies to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogalla aquifer, of vast underground water sources.
"This is a real path forward," said Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
In order to do this, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentologists, but loved by working groups, who rely on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to oil pipeline.
But Nebraska’s legislators opposed to this plan pressure that a law to force the removal from the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing Environmental Impact Assessment found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Department's Inspector-General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist committed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice for its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle pursued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit from fear
A family in New York states that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a violence dechain in the hall of their Manhattan building has scared their little daughter to the point where she vomited it from fear.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" draw scared the little 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so much that she has suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increasing fear of foreigners," says her family during the trial of the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his child garden teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for family trip.
As Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Whoever came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes," and I went to find her," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
“She told me with an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’ Roseanna Monk said.
"I answered him, 'What you say or think I'm not interested in.'
She became angry and began to use swords - the word "" and the word "" with a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me with the water from the bottle.
She said that this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
“I told this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ the mother of the child said.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surrounding person who led her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but didn't get any answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a work of charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a nursing teacher with a child of 18 months old.”
Climate adversity has blocked the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and the economy declined.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the main early of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange of the economics.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the State economy for growth, caused a generally decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified primarily by the historical decline of 31.16 percent in the agricultural sector, which affected the other economy.
According to the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development assignment report, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main harmful crops were the vegetables and the maize.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate of the state rate rated from the first three quarters of the year was an average rate of 74,9 to the first quarter of the year.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way, it is not easy that they work and invest in them."
Migration held
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who abandon the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, first because of entry difficulties and second because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding job, these people stay here and demand sources of work there, which makes unemployment rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the signoen labour market is worsened by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that dominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in this state works there without contributing as a worker in no social insurance institutions.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state is low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Labour and Social Forecast Secretariat.
The average monthly income of signoen workers was, until September, 5,000,352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7,000,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in foreign direct investment in the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat registered state IED from January to June reached $630,000,697 in the same period, which represents a decline of $4.743,3 million in the same period.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mostly registered by companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July to the public congress approval of a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state sector congress was none of 2,600 billion pesos and until November.
Reactions
For employer sector representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of Government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the State Government.
“The performance of the Sinaloa economy this year has been really very poor, we need to work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we need to double our efforts, we needed to align everyone’s effort and especially the right already synchronized march of this new government team, hopefully that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as the early year's frosts have retained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"Low economic flow is produced by several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn quickly enough to generate economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of e flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said it is intended to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic management of the state, because it is important that we break down all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that better canals the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in economic development, there are a few advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He reported that the current administration has shown advances in the way of management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
One person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days fine for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The Prosecutor-General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variety of marijuana possession intended for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of El Castillo, Navolato, number 80.
The small trafficker circulated in a pick-up, white-colored truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's bag carrier and on the copilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person is still in the Centre for Enforcement of Juridical Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to the works
Works of social character contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development stated that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
“They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything, even though since July they had to give us a part,” he said, “and we, to not record any delays, have started the works and have advanced a lot, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided at that time.
“We had already undergone this in the previous sixteennational period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, have had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said they had filed the appeal to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as quickly as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they gave us nothing.”
The Court valid "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digitals is one of the biggest changes the world has suffered in the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalid it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his duties when issued the decree detailing the actions to be followed to concretize the transition to digital Earth TV.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as a non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a law-reserved attribution to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
In favour of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversys to dispute the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions it provided for for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the draft that Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible for.
In his intervention, the President said he was not in agreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structur the measures to prepare for the public administration to do so through general standards.
"I also consider that if it was done, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate of the governance of the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality, and more chains.
It would be to delay the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.
These issues, he emphasized, "requires the operation of an entire system establishing, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issue of the disputed decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, because in the administrative sphere it ensures that the laws issued by the legislative, he assured.
The possibility of counting "voting by vote" in Michoacán is analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,000 74 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality regarding the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 8 thousand to 74b proce.
In this sense, Chair of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not approved its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline had ended for that electoral trial to be entered into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted the publication of the State.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative power and described the vote of the State's official for constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because it does not have the right to "sanction or dispute them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to achieve the partial and total vote counts by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more packages, may be that: the results of the proceedings do not coincide; there is no vote record and counting in the case of the urn is not in the president of the urn; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the proceedings.
Furthermore, the total counting of the votes received in all the election urns may be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate winner of the respective election and the candidate who received the second place in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the candidate/represe.
The total count of the vote may also be achieved if at the end of the common count it results that the difference between the alleged winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose second candidate was released, in which the electoral packages were excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total proceedings.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the sierra of Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, Sunday around night, and Monday people will host their tributes and there will be a missing of requiem.
According to his family, Lieutenant Colonel's last will was that his ashes were spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes to other people died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortes returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the watch chapel of the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends went.
At 7:30 p.m., he was honoured the Technological Institute of Saltillo organized by his former technological colleagues and the U.S. football team Felipe Bacio when preparing for the bachelor’s degree.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and to spread his ashes in the Sierra of Zapalinamé, he has always said that 'has his family and friends'," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, Lieutenant Colonel had realized all her dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of her life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother, and he had a lot of care for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they said he had even truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was seven, he travelled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, so he knows that his uncle is dying by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His last goodbye
With honors he said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Aerial Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the distinguished People and Government of State, the Mexican Army study, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Aerial Force and the Students in Salté.

Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented before the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed by shooting in different parts of the body and with the grace coup, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 mile road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have passed through this place have observed that in the property, whose closure has beige color and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; at his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a meter away there was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were stretched on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because we didn’t find any in situ sleeves.
In the closure of the property there were legends directed by a group of organized crime towards the other, except a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to sequestrations, murders, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to published information, in a first fact, on 11 November in Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and they managed to save one who had been deprived of freedom.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".

By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m. one of his complices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are assigned clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government to face a crisis that put the country on the edge of the economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government facing a crisis that put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed of technocrats in its majority, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner for Journalists said.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
“The framework is now well traced,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that increased its debt costs to levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity required by European leaders to recover the trust in Italy that had been affected.
By emphasizing the pressure on Monti to speed, the instability of markets placed the return of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s opportunities for success were significantly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new devastating financial market attack.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth and women organizations on Monday.
He will end his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of €1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections, planned for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections advanced.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist on the fact that it should only be formed by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that reciprocal mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is greater than the Costa Ricans
Of 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, FIFA's number one monthly ranking, have a broad record of inter-selected games class A, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the Star League and in powerful England Premier League clubs, maintain intense activities in national league and cut championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we need to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated European Cup and World Football Eliminators.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guardian Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (defense 0-1 in London) matched the record of the former goal guardian Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the cerebral flyer of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other 100-year-olds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
100-year-old loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the shooter Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azopeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even happen at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Eder Nelson are not starting yet.
Spain's historical scorer is David Villa, with 50 flys, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality.”
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on Stade National.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream becoming reality to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and Sunday 20 will make its unique stopover in Central America.
On that day they will appear at the Stade National, starting at 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose complete transcription is found in La Nación sur Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream becoming reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent the vacation in Costa Rica once; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to spend a few days there.
So it feels like we carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is some sort of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in the past days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
It took 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we're sorry that so much time had to spend until this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope it has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to make surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through the gents who love surfing.
By watching the tour, you birds offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions regarding what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What is it due to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have no longer interpreted for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises because it reminds us the reasons why we loved these songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people as well.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined we would go to form a big rock band, and the fact that we have done it for more than 20 years makes it seem a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together, we feel a lot of emotions.
We love and love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group comes from a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to be part of this Seattle sound that emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and second, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We trust each other with everyone’s music and that couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what has brought it, without taking into account the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which really doesn't interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we didn’t publish a record before Andy’s death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustrations for the fact that she lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who began in the band with us and when I listen to a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh of working, it was always a lot of fun.
He was a surprising human being and we miss it.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words live for?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don’t know.
It is he who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little offline from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time, and if it’s relevant now, I think that it’s wonderful, because it’s a music worth listening and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At the beginning, her music had darker content and now it became more positive.
What is this change due to?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cryed when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and music and these songs, probably, represent this for me.
I also think you can also be happy and even so you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori rehospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized at a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his feet, told his family doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who purges a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said for television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the redemption of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, it has weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori purges the detention since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a military destruction escadron that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by Uruguay’s President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the region’s political themes.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,” according to the news released by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French official Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the tax paradise list, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continue to be tax heavens from the international community, a statement that led to Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultations with his ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairman of the G20 since November, a group formed from the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried the past years to seize the implementation of tax exchange agreements to exit the "gri list" of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumbier goes into three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will struggle for the love of youngster in stereoscopical technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to well exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," Nintendo's specialist press officer Omar Álvarez said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said Super Mario 3D Land is “the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support,” as to date successes such as “Star Fox 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D” were the adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a “accessible” video game that allows a fast and smooth part.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
Furthermore, users will be able to choose in real time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and “do not succumb to optical illusions.”
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also supposes the character to return to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games, he looks at the saga’s followers and repeats the successful formula of previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plumber must browse mine platforms of danger to release Princess Peach.
Even if I find new features in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom agrees to the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of $70 million.
Thus the trial ends so Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision obeyed the independence of the judicial and executive power, taking into account the fact that a first-instance court had already ordered its extradition.
He claimed that during his term he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given rule to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did suggests an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional instances to judge the former officer of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC) resolutions, Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely appealed to the Department of Defense when he was president, the trial before the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The Trinijove social support entity’s first 25 years of life is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the long century of workplaces currently obtained by this social group is added.
The anniversary served yesterday to review in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly trained, workless people with addiction or marginalized problems.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Regional Government of Catalan (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the act former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former Mayor assistant to Mayor and current eco-socialist municipal advisor Ricard Goma.
Also attended in the large Fabra i Coats room, the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and Charity Director-General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult era and that of the present time is also, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate for 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property yesterday at noon without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Rue Balmes number 51 lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned yesterday at midday the building they were illegally occupied and where they organized micro-feasts that desperate neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took over the electrical installation and some of the water, except painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the masses festivities, which lasted up to two days and desperate the tenants.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that after the occupation of the building, her affair dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco recorded that the invaders of the property were unfair, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the recreation site owner had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to this, the trouble was not caused by the disco customers, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the festivals held there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighborns of the area.
The disco manager explained that the trouble was so big that it even resulted in an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months ago that the owner "forgives him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (Municipal Police) has also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
President of the municipal PP, Alberto Fernández Díaz, said last week, “the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common and civil life that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area.”
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be unpleasant against the antisocial behavior generated in property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 a.m. the police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond controversy on fees
The Municipal Competition on the 16 Doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the middle of the 1980s, at the peak of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed Collserola promotion posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient to the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - lower (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with blowjobs in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall summoned a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door returns to the idea of park, undoubtedly.
It's that, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, both in relation to its organization and in relation to thinking about the city, is a theme of conversation by all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former castle speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three Barcelona architects, academic professors, have coincided.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to "debate on the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green houses, has not been completed.
“We must start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the verdict gave the architect for which the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexic foot": one should not think of these "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some risks".
Risks that arise from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had in the area of the Forum "his cygne song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, its excess.
“We need to think of new urbanistic instruments, planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters.”
By standing more on the question, Modol opins that, simplifying the versant of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that “must not be lost,” thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project “from the first moment.”
Furthermore, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he said) that we had to create: "We architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest is missing a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "There have been summoned 16 cross-sea contests in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that passes and understands the area as a whole."
This does, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, a zone of equipment that carries out a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonas Larrazábal and this will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Legal Power Foundation of Casino Red granted forgiveness to Mayor of Monterrey's brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged chantages.
After spending 72 years in detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Red Casino gives him forgiveness before the Second Penal Court of the District, which follows a trial for chanting against the brother of Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly required him to pay an economic quote for the Mayor of Monterrey to allow the illegal operation of the gambling house.
Following the public denunciation, the Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Mayor's brother of the PANist and on 2 September it was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Center of Detention 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Officer of the Public Department dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the criminal center of Cadereyta supposedly for having singing with a million and a half pesos the owners of the Red Casino; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-safety detention center because there were threats to death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the District's Second Criminal Court Secretary Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that of the income of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange to allow his operation.
On Monday, the founding of the legal power of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented before Judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the Mayor’s brother of the region; he could therefore recover his freedom in the following hours.
During legal formalities, the Officer of the Public Ministry attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house associates had been the one who granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011 Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal forgiveness and subsequently no claims relating to the proceedings against him shall be filed; no compensation for damage or punishment shall be requested.
After the hearing of the founded legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
Court Secretary Jorge Yanez moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonah that he had been forgiven legally and his file would be classified.
He will also give him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reports details of the air accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost his life indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Secretary of Communications and Transport Dionisio Pérez Jácome mentioned that before the aircraft was launched, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it meets the requirements necessary to transport staff.
Furthermore, he said that investigations done in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground coins.
“In a research reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact has been structurally presented.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The floor had a pant of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary has assured that one priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Chief Executive Officer of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the impact time, the Presidential Major State helicopter was working in a speed of cruising and that happened on a soft ascending ground.
“This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising operation at the time of impact,” he said.
During the press conference, SCT holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautic regulation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the ICCM mentioned adequate conditions for departure, and as the aircraft moved towards the border zone between DF and the state of Mexico there were low-high nebulosity layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the conditions of nebulosity the crew has sought a zone of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far assumes that the impact has occurred on a right and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion model of the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter has hit soil under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
There is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the groundwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he possibly has been departing during his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in an area more wide than the surrounded place, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic Obesity of Children and Teenagers' protocol to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties at the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the people who have the right or not are invited to participate in the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence for minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the objective of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (South of District Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North of District Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the objective of knowing the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years, with their parents' consent and under the supervision, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family heritage of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, and insulin and genetics (sought to identify people associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of healthcare professionals for alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years, in the case of boys, there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase,” IMSS said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He added that on average, Mexicans have 65% of Indo-American heritage, 30% of European and 5% of African heritage, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics result in the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
It even says that the presence of dark color folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even prediabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, physicians give it in writing to parents, to whom each is explained the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the highest calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet beverages, carbon hydrates (tamals - corn meat pasted wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high content of fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM’s asphalt would avoid casting
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were solved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cracks every rain season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at UNAM’s Chemistry Faculty (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of the pavement is completely reduced or the cases.
During his conference, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve efficiency, and consequently, the formation of cassing.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the paved its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, at almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures asphalt becomes casting, added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in majority were covered by a flexible pavement composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the more surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small asphalt-baked stones and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, it signals, is baded an asphalt.
When the vehicles go there by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer would consider.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, of the sand that is also baded as asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with vehicle wheels, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that the pavement be adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the efficiency of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to form, which breaks down all layers of the paved and consequently causes the breakdown.
In the process of formating a cass, he says, the first that destroys is the bearing film and only subsequently the asphalt layer is affected, but damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be taken care of the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paved must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and enable to repair the cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What missed Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to not get Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle receives her title #14 of Princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess and Melina (1989), Isabella del Cauca (1989), Category: Category: Girls (1989), Category: Category:)
Today, the big question that many people ask themselves is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Miss Vogue, the titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro's who are taken up.
The first key factor considered in the decision taken by the jury to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of Valle's candidate to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culturalizing, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it is a quite deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment" is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Arrogance of Blood".
This answer did not prefer first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain concretely how each quoted book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what is going to happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions launched there is that Valley was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insisted that being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the audience's vote for the best craftsmanship, and Queen Mother), "they awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine.
And this was noted in his first bath suit presentation at Hilton beach and his two parades of the Crown's Eve.
Although at the two parades she appeared safe of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the RCN Channel’s “Como à casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess “confirms that the candidate who receives most awards during the contest does not receive the Queen’s Crown.”
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another assumption is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
This is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the Competition starts, they have already been involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by its behind defects and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate "Natural Beauty" with the healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queen Preparator Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there was better, but “his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality had not been too notorious for me, left him points the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos considers the mistake of the candidate in Valle was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The surgery is good, but Valle didn’t know how to do it.
Her body has never been her assets and she has lost because of this aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Competition for the first time returns, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a little gift that Raymundo made to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of rule, not as a sovereign, or as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her splendid passage by Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
This was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali dactyloscopist went into history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a Cali CTI dactyloscopist passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme chief of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the local offices of the ICT, this week was the tour of “availability” of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after having had adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and one of them was suspected to be the one of the man who was leading the oldest guerilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize it for his physical aspect, because it was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the footprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, ink, a breeder and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the map.
His eye didn’t mislead him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the supreme chief of the FARC.
Looking for the footprint
For a Sijín de Cali dactyloscopist the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without a margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, dactyloscopics support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told him that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had pushed his hand to bring out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint with all our hands and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he said.
The footprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
By intermediate investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspicious of crime and in fact a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn’t guarantee that he is the assassin, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted."
When they appear, a breeder or a strip is used to take them up.
Subsequently, the footprints are sent to Asif, the decline database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," the ICT expert said.
He explained that everything is not as shown in the CSI TV program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that you touch does not strongly become a footprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "Individuals" Challenge Authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators bow up in front of Zuccotti square to camp there.
Most people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighboring park.
The Occupational Wall Street movement integrators challenged New York’s authorities on Tuesday trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated in the dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were busculating in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access through a judicial order that allows the 'indigenous' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupating a park northern the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp again in the place, we’re going to set up another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said one of the spokesmans of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignates" to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation from the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the 'indigenous' have occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the Holland tunnel entrance, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray couldn’t confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw a few journalists who had also passed handlets.
The organization ensures that there were hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved to support the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them in front of the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a private-owned presence - remains closed until waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled on Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning is to be analyzed.
Some displaced demonstrators carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and even delivered it to the officers who watched the place, causing “some small clashes,” Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials struck the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of Wall Street occupation or apply laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before.
Mayor Bloomberg said before the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned to them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out in the morning in place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because of the fact that the protesters 'infringed the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt others" because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
“The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,” the spokesman of the movement added, who accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupational Wall Street officials also said they don't think they're organising "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian television Christmas.
The private CTV television channel today announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Marie.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the broadcast on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, Mötley Crüe, Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Maria, supporting in a puppet that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appeared come Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, the CTV special Christmas program also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Buble called "pute" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Renews After Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the decline in early March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing after the devastating earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in the Nippon country since the Second World War.
The Government of Tokyo's first estimates calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a coup that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, Gross Interior Product data between July and September served to finally turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also supposes the highest rise since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rise.
However, the true stimulant of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate or reconstruct infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan woke up mainly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by rising spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Yen stigma
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" elected by investors who flee the debt crisis in the eurozone and United States forecast disorders, a privilege that weighs like a plate in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have made the Yen contribution responsible for their low results between July and September.
While markets continue their seats in EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease the guard.
"The persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen must be monitored," said Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's reflection points highlighted that the main powers are braked.
For it has dropped four decimals up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, n down to eight decimals up to 99.13 points.
Athens Feeds Doubts Again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to blend into the labyrinth that leads to the outbreak of the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the new Hellen transitional Government's "consensus" is rather imposed by Brussels' requirements than by a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos said yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy Antonis Samaras required the proposed February election, assured that he would not support the new measures of his reinforcement.
“The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October Summit,” Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of trust for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not doubt about his position: “We are committed to helping the transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the organizations that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently required, and clearly said he will not approve any commitment letters to achieving the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, said yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambitions as soon as possible."
Spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even though there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes Spain's "presidential" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a global leadership in the role of microfinances."
Queen Sofía has recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-and-World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very especially the poverty, in the one that has been living as a half of the incoming people.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes this task with "responsibility," said Queen Sofía, who hoped that initiatives and loans originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the most poor women."
We have “reached a lot of goals” and “we are facing a lot of challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum of debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" should be boosted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are leaving the poverty threshold in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía emphasized as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admiral idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she knows since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings like those celebrated at Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I could see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "family chief" of the poor part of Vallidlado.
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries to eras of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits suppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main lines of development cooperation.”
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the “success” of giving “confidence” to people “excluding whom all close the door”; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed people present in a city that “opens its contaminated doors of the solidarity spirit.”
CDU proposes electing European President with universal vote
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) congress, on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without really difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but it was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy activists who judge the government's policy too laxist towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the CEO, was adopted with almost unanimousness.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstened.
The steady ovation of several minutes, after their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhilic minister of finance, did not doubt.
The idea-master of the Chancellor - and the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the European Commission's President in universal vote "to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and CDU leaders believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the jack is laid.
Similarly, the delegates rejected with an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country at the Executive Board of the European Central Bank based on the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced the weight of Germany.
In order to soothe the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not also seek to win her congress on the back of “little” European countries or difficult countries to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in the hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in disease arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on illness stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allocation box, and pronounce a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which comes from a willingness to make savings in a context of strictness, but is not less announced for an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on illness stops.
First of all, for a budgetary savings purpose: the government plans to impose private employees on a fourth day of deficiency before taking care of a work stop.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days of wage, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that may cause anger, but would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: imposing on officials a day of non-compensation deficiency in the event of discontinuation of work (they have so far no deadline of deficiency, against three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the theme of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to work arrests.
“Controls will be much higher and, in addition, if you’re taken, you’ll pay back,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL micro Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stops.
Indeed, it has been the objective of continuous follow-up and political offensive since 2002, which most often have produced their fruits.
French people are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily compensation accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this, 46% concerned maternity leave and labour accidents, and 54% concerned illness stops — €6.2 billion.
And therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain gaps: another survey, published in 2007 by Monster.com’s career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any disease stop day.
Another study, this time of the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbors, French employees are not more inclined to work stops elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud is very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reachs a low scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has been a systematic control of disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long" (37,050 cases).
In cases of arrests over 45 days, which were systematically controlled, 11% of “inappropriate or unjustified” cases were counted on 1.2 million, i.e. 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 “unjustified” cases on several million employees who had a disease stopped.
A number that represents very little face, for example, to that of black work.
According to MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, it would account for EUR 9 to 15 billion of lack of tax earnings annually, more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than fraud.
Papademos: Greece will need to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to rectify its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said Monday before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days given to his government of union would not be enough to carry out this task.
“In order to continue the efforts to restore the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of the government, who pronounced his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the “primary task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the eurozone is “at stake,” he added.
As a result, Papademos anticipated that the country's public deficit will be reduced by "approximately 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, right-wing leader, on Monday supported the already approved measures to attempt to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not be committed to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
At Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras said his word was sufficient and would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, a committee of experts says
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts linked to various fields including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient judged competent to make such a decision.
Experts cited a recent survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the globe.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid of addressing the subject of death.”
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report experts entrusted by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die at the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said nothing to change the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted on non-competent or non-consentent persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signator of the report, said yesterday in teleconference, there would be more cases of these overflowings in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Favourable to Euthanasia
Let’s remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have an effect to send the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valued.
As for those who have been practicing assisted suicide, the surveyed estimates 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the report authors say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, called the position of the signatory experts of the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminal-phase patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask him to help suicide," said Me Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the person’s autonomy above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society, he says, there are tags and constraints.”
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “a strong opposition” to the report’s conclusions, which she called “pro-euthanasia manifest.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular disputes the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Dames denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Participants of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures intensified on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria yesterday, which, with Russia’s support, resists and denounces a “complete” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took position in favour of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “remove power” in Syria where a quarantine of civilians and regime forces have still been killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview to the BBC.
Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have been solved by a failure.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country with which Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States, on its side, congratulated Syrian consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, and countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly harder tone” against repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians have killed in the Homs-secrated town, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country was “leading towards the end of the crisis.”
He has strongly responded to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he believes is “a dangerous step.”
“Syria will “not flash,” he added, assuring that “Ourdis plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "Civil Protection Mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take the point of view on the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from cities in charge of the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov judged the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan while remaining supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time on markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little bit of time on the markets to train his team and implement a program that will contain “sacrifices” in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and the employer today.
It should set up a relatively restricted cabinet consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting the appointed president of the Council.
President of the House of Parliament, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a restricted list, probably a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonds yesterday, asking them for time.
In "Democracy, there are specific times" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "sure that the markets will be patient and understand."
Its appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern resumed the top, particularly after an unexpected drop in the eurozone industrial production in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should be a team with mainly technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament’s confidence by Friday.
Mr. Monti committed himself, once he came into office, to work in the emergency and with the aim that Italy "become protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested further rigorous measures.
Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also emphasized the need to resume the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place by April 2012 for €200 billion of state bonds.
Russian scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear weapon detonator, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk said Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA announced last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS widely drawing from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military center in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and had been involved in the manufacturing of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iran Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA evokes "of strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system "has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during most of its career on this technology within its country's military nuclear program."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violences dropped slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of “hate crimes” increased to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” the Human Rights Organization First stressed, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organisation added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and need to do more to tackle these abuses,” he added, estimating that this could go through an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is an inheritance of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter micro-blog site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, particularly to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more readily track the activity of other "Tweets", the users who follow messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know whether they follow messages, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network Monday, Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinct functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rediffuse a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiated, thus opens up to a broader audience with a more comparable handling to that of the broad public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated “tweets” on the interest of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
“Activity functionality will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream,” he told @dannykronstrom.

Inscription of a "gold rule" in the Constitution
The government of large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to enter into the constitution a "gold rule" budget to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by Austria’s rating agencies in the sovereign rating (triple A).
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision after a council of ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debt of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was lowered by only one crank, from AAA to AA+, we should pay more than three billion euros of interest every year,” argued Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the summit of the member countries of the eurozone in Brussels last October: Heads of State and Government had then requested the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government approaches the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% each year of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% each year of the GDP, while regional states and municipalities will have to make budgets at a balance.
The objective is to move public debt to the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Nippon authorities would re-interfere on the exchange market if the yen should continue to rise.
“We’ll intervene as we’ve done last time if we see excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen dated not far from the historical levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yens for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 compared to the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly risen since, doped by purchases of investors who consider it as a "value of refuge" at these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was returned on Tuesday under the 77 yens and the euro dropped under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar amounted to around 120 yens and the euro over 160 yens.
This flame of the Japanese currency hurts the archipelago’s exports as it reduces the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese companies when converting them into a national currency.
"Japan's fight for reconstruction" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that this retardance of the yen does not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third global economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of exports and consumption of households led by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister decided that the cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” suggesting that no additional monetary breakdown was to wait on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the emissions institute increased its Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), increasing the limit of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rates rise, exchanges flank
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still undermining European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to rise.
Always worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European Stock Exchanges fall a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
"With new tensions on borrowing returns from the Eurozone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
“Invectors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange declined by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed market stakeholder fears about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has an eye on Europe and trade will continue in a tight corridor of variations until investors will have no evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurrection of concerns about the future of the eurozone penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it dropped after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, gathered in congress Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in trouble to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
Italy and Spain's borrowing rates remain at very concerning levels.
On Tuesday morning, the return of Italian 10-year-old bonds reaches 6.85%, which of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of southern countries, but also in France, continue to foster the fears of stakeholders.
Head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "major task" of his government.
Spain is on the market gazeline, while the elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic higher.
In waiting for growth figures in the eurozone
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than expected 0.3%, led by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the number of the second quarter to decrease, with a decrease of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is the fourth one who is most concerned with economists.
Germany, on the other hand, has grown by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must overcome dogmas
While it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under emotional impact, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that a electoral appointment is an opportunity to think about such issues and instead of nuclear issues.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will lead to a double demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population deprives a vital element.
At the same time, we will need to stop the rarefaction of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate deregulations, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacement, nor for Switzerland, which just wants to build only last-generation power plants.
In contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite them only, continue their projects with determination.
The U.S. decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the decline in the price of electricity, an energy addiction aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a collapse of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these disappointed effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Wind Champion Europe, from which he takes 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittent; according to which, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the part of nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not demonstrate a principle opposition to this energy, the polls show it.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Heavily exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative of non-localized jobs.
If France had decided to get out of nuclear, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the six billion euros annually of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a grief skin.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run sixty years as the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to resolve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, no more than the devil.
Areva’s development of low-emission CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have an Authority of Safety that exercises an intransigent and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville plant.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited with the same safety obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human mistakes caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw the teachings of this accident, as it had done for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design making it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a plant, the ceasefire of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them the way to take up leadership in the essential development of nuclear.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the emotion, dogmas and supporting manoeuvres dominate such a debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various aspects - in order to provide police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, this policy is compatible with the self-proclaimed "human rights country" status of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment that foreign students have made the news, the Minister of Interior (read May 23 Liberation) proclaiming in the passage that France "doesn't need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely analyzed from the economic angle.
It is that there is a quite broad consensus on this issue between left and right.
On the right hand, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who in 1976 stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande cantones to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth.
Restrains anemic immigration growth and damages employment.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are at risk of replacing national workers, particularly the low-qualified, exerting down pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in reality much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly exercising jobs in sectors with lack of employment.
Low qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Like a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anesthetics, these complementarity between nationals and migrants cause immigrant arrivals to have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (heavy proportion of immigrants naturalized among U.S. Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 in Germany will contribute a net contribution (revenues less expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to go to the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to dissuade immigrants, had the exact reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him, who, for inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarisms, the Holocaust, the Goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have believed that sufficient for democracy to permanently triumph its enemies, to exercise vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
Since Napoleon "the Little" it is known that it was an ease of thinking.
The universal vote, to be the required condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are living is a economic crisis, but it is the same, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The pallinody of the true Greek fake referendum has in this regard had a double revelator value: that of the need for a powerful return to politics, but also that of the troubling feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight have moved today, and that for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organized in accordance with the needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump joined in the vacuum of the nationalist replies: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cut-offs, but a common exercise of full right, serene and continuous choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - no longer where to stop the enumeration - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the entire Europe that folds on the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe that gently loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outbreak of crisis will suppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course leading us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Otherwise.
But thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let’s make Europeans.
Chip cards "contactless" generalize
The World Chip Card Lounge opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
Indeed, 2011 is expected to end with an increase in global microprocessor card sales (bank card, phone with SIM card...) by 11 percent, to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most carrier segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay public transport or pay your purchases by simply approaching a reader’s card.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to further increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for nearly 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for non-contact payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the buckets double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million MasterCard Pass cards without contact.
To move to the higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two large French institutions have committed to systematically distributing bank cards equipped for non-contact in the future to their customers,” announced Gérard Nébouy, CEO Visa Europe France.
Banks tested payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the method of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They took a delay."
"But they should finally know a real rise next year."
“We are boarding on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
The banks are going ahead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a contact-free payment case.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Supposedly, the links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty."
“The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is good cooperation,” he explained without further precision.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have launched gateways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by Aqmi’s relatives, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the next day with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the decays of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past appeals to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says himself close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is an advance, but we may have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It’s been known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had been increasingly obvious in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosives and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has thus pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninterested illuminates.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "western education is a sin" - promotes the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
She politizes herself and demands strict respect for sharia while her activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
These are first aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying the attacks on the police offices.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without shades.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, living arrest, is killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took over to the police's secure chief executive in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalians of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The World According to Republican Candidates to Presidency
On China, on Iran, on help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and unawareness.
Can an America weakened by the crisis handle a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonitruous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on the aid of Israel, slogans - often unsupported - fuse.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the appointment of the Grand Old Party, threatened to drag the Chinese in front of the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme in an America exaggerated by the migration of whole pans from its industry to Asia.
So bad if this must involve the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Chinese ambassador in Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has almost stumbled in the face of an attitude that "flatted" emotions.
He called for a muscle but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of polls, remains inheritable.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations towards this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows a embarrassing unknown records.
Recently, he called on to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "attempts to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said himself ready to engage the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy cargo in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism.
They insist rightly on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the departure of Iraq’s “boys” too fast, on his tergiversations in Libya, thereby sticking a label of weakness.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers rather positive Obama’s national safety balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has disbelieved on the military interventions that lead to the closure.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more fairly.
The North Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must supply gas for equivalent to 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and end buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve commander of Russian gas entry into the western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region with the country of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge building has victory airs.
The project had been heavily disputed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will in fact enable the delivery of gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Therefore, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes harder for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
In the strongest of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means whether the subject is politically sensitive.
West Europe, by giving its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a break between Eastern and West Europeans.
Russia knew, in just five years, to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, heavily gas consumers, and whose settlements are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,” François Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how great gas contracts are as political as well as economic.
All this explains the broad smile posted by Gazprom leaders, present in number at Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploitation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-shaved steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is located on the bottom of the sea, on average 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating back to World War II.
“A hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed by precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It also needed to multiply measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but project managers resigned there while the Swedish were unwilling to see a Russian state society permanently established outside their coastlines.
"In the event of awareness, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is thus escaped into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who planned the welds to experience a leakage every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters, he delivered accurate information about the possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure, and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have united their strengths to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture named Nord Stream, charged with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then rented the company, for twenty renewable years, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of actually transported gas,” said Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided at 30% by shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to enter their fees, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, high 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour spending.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million an hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
He has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know it today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is charged with the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin (skin of butterflies) which refers to a cotton lacquer used to cover banks, for example.
This type of book was very favoured by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has tasted an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open in mind and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its debut, counts nearly 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her bookbooks in bookshops, from the Fnac to small town shops and has been able to impose her identity.
“We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, schedule, pens, computer covers... The brand declines on a whole range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of workers with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is opened today.
Despite voluntary public policy established in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress made for fifteen years has been considerable."
“The unemployment rate at the time was not two but three times higher.”
"There is still a lot to be done."
It should be said that for unemployed people, many obstacles remain before access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the box and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment, and that " constitute the node of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
It remains not said, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchair, psychological or intellectual deficiencies".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, as set out in a... 1987 law.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates to real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What of Happiness"
Before fighting the Blues Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure offered by this friendly match.
We're not going to write that there was consciousness between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stadium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have well done peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector only praises him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to go ahead,” assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, he justified itself."
“I’m in Lille all year round, which isn’t the case with Belgium.”
"I need to take my marks."
Hazard, awarded against Romania Friday night for this match against France, comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill".
However, without ignoring the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supporting,” he says.
This must be involved in further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially as in the face, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"We've crossed up right now."
"To play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part mentioned "fireness".
"Featured" of fighting "a gala match."
"Ferted" also to note - as a "neighborhood" - that France has become "a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder work," he excited.
As Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would look good to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our small Belgians become great,” he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to be aware of it in the next matches." That against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento began with a lot of optimists its return dam in front of Bosnia (22:00), on Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seeing it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been at the board since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debullon.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal has dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
“This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk because we haven’t marked a goal outside.”
But at their home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public that should be there as boiling, even though the party is “obviously very tight,” says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we’re quite convinced that we can take over,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have 50% chances of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
Bosnia’s Friday reported null forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A none can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
“This is a good result, which, however, poses a certain risk because we haven’t marked a goal outside,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is realistic this time.
