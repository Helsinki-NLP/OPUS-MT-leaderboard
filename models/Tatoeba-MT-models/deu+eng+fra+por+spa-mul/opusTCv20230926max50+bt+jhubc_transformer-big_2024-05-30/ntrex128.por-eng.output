Deputies of the Wales Assembly fear to "pass by Marretas"
There is a consternation by some members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title is changed to MWP (Members of the Wales Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is on the plans to change the assembly's name to "Galish Parliament".
Some members of this Assembly, coming from all political colors, fear that this would make them fall ridiculous.
An AM worker said the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation to rime with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Wales readers: in the Wales language, "twp" means "fool" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM of Plaid stated that the group in its globality “was not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A Galese conservative member stated that the group was “open in mind” with respect to the change of the name, but pointed out that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the w letter in English has a similar pronunciation to that of the u letter in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name amendments, stated: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are designated will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to appoint the Assembly by "Parliament Galese".
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favored "Galese Parliament Members", or WMP, but MWP option was most favored in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other amendments to the way the Assembly performs its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When debating legislation, AMs will have the final word on the matter of how they should be designated.
Macedonians Refer to the Change of Name
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country’s name to “North Macedonia Republic”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to solve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its neighbor north constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly made objections to its requests for membership to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the plebiscit on the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Sinos silence at a time when the Harlem churches fight for survival
“In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke with told me that there was a bar and a church in each corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there's neither one nor another."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, he understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said today.
“The bars stopped being the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are traveling regularly.”
As to the churches, it concerns the eventual money earned with the sale of heritage does not last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartments with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore such a hurry will be on the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was then set up by a black congregation that performed its cults nearby.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to 125th Street retailers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged, however, when they made the plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishes ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriel "the bells of the poor."
The expert who touched the carrier in July called him something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an unsubstitutable historical instrument."
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world’s first carrier to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carrier in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in the last few months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the leader of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "seek to repair the costs of it", badly the fact that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark causes wounds in 13-year-old teenagers in a lagost hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lagoon hunting diving in California on the first day of the lagoon season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel declared to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as much as he heard the boy shouting for help, and then removed towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel claimed that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a laguner, but then he realized that the boy shouted "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the key was dilacered, described Hammel what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I prayed everyone to come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical state.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that he was considered not belonging to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research purposes and for safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, assessed at £2.8 billion, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and home items retreat, these largest cosmetic sections will be tested in 11 stores spread across the country and will be implemented in more stores next year.
This investment in cosmetics results from the demand, by supermarkets, of ways to use exhibition space used once for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its beauty product catalog with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also get more space with brand areas similar to shops like Boots.
The supermarket network is also launching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
Furthermore, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London, last week. The second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small daily quantities in proximity stores led to supermarkets now have to strive more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, Executive Chairman of Sainsbury's, said stores will be increasingly similar to large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it has acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that such a reinforced sales of merchandise products and made the purchases more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute about the revenue distribution of health product stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million for three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a broad range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized colleagues training, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our brand range has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones “furious” after Holly Willoughby abandoned £11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones became “furious” after Holly Willoughby’s TV host left a £11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for branding items for home and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Den Peter Jones’ Dragons star left by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on its new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones became "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (whose value may amount to £1.5 million) implied that she would no longer have time to devote to her home brand articles and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and it was expected to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, “Truly was far the highest of Holly’s priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave made everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of items ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning presenter, which is among Britain’s most profitable shelters, may cost the company millions, given the advanced investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to homewear and items, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples make holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity ITV's program host.
A source near Jones said last night that “we don’t want to comment on your business.”
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. president joyfully mentioned the criticism that it would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider “indignous of a president” and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, in his pretendly voice of "telejournal pivot."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a major step in denuclearization of North Korea.
Nevertheless, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “correspondent response” from the U.S. to the first steps of North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the committee.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to enter war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relationships with Kim brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages, and the return to the country of the deadly remains of U.S. military.
Furthermore, he advocated his unusual approach when he spoke about Kim’s relationships.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this superloted arena, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the rescue of Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been dismantled, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for international aid channeling.
“Unfortunately, they were in many cases clear to declare that they are not asking for international aid; so it becomes a little difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will lead to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant land tremors suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not generally seen in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm sirene in Palu, poor degree of the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, travelling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of infrastructure decrept a central piece of his electoral campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the shortage of funding has destroyed Mr. Joko's executive at a time when he faces his reelection next year.
The president is also being pressed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced while Christian and Muslim groups were fighting on the streets using catans, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long rematch for Chelsea's goal
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a Xherdan Shaqiri pass when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea’s beacon, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to your left before making a shot towards the second trail.
In the attempt, the ball fled high over the large area by heading to the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga flight and fell inside the network.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq move forward as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrived, I touched, and I didn't think too much about the thing.
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after scoring a goal at the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
At this stage, the advanced blue gave a hip pass back to Mateo Kovacic before demarcating near the middle field and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the middle field.
Then he made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
This crossed the defenses and got the goal against the network of the second train with a hit with the left foot that passed through the Liverpool Alisson Becker network.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the Champions League at 3pm Wednesday afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of dead in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said early Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the debris of buildings that dropped during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that destroyed.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament became the most recent monument swallowed by the contesting of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls the perpetrated by the Talibans of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to Westminster Palace became a target to shoot.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness of the opinion of the 19th century and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether this constitutes a completely accurate description is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually notorious figure that represents a side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration.”
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwest China market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead, with a blood cut and covered artery, near a well on the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, is read at South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The suiniculture is preparing to inject vaccines in pigs in a swine farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring well.
In this well, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in the mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 pounds, had attacked the suiniculture until death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered with blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his name “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Safety camera shooting shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 in the morning on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager declared to Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the site of the event.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig with 300 pounds immobilised a Gallese farm against her tractor until the woman managed to shock the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as "stimulation".
"They're just playing.
They like belishing, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
It is only necessary to show them the right respect," he said.
Rescue of the Rose Hurricane is expected to bring widespread strong rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is weakening by moving over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire north of Mexican and southwest of the US in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Sunday East Time, Rosa caused 137 km/h bursts, a category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will start pushing a strong tropical humidity north-west in the southwest U.S. area.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At the time, the tropical humidity that interacts with depression in approach will produce widespread rains in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods with debris and possibly land healing in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwestern areas, especially on much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapid aggravation conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unavoidable to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can cause the paradeers to turn into brave rivers and the throttles will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring strong precipitation over parts of the southern California coastal line.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small waste and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
Some dispersed tropical waters will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain become more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread at the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools, however, tropical areas will remain pretty friendly.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. area on Sunday.
There is a difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and extend again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. zone is expected to register a hot start in October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach the 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above the average in the U.S. eastern area until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s audience
More than 20 million people watched at six television stations last night witnessing Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations to interrupt regular scheduling due to a last-minute turn: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week’s investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely sure Kavanaugh hit her while drunk and tried to dismiss her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely sure that this didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has difficulties in measuring audiences of those seeing programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave strong support to Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million speakers during the entire day-long audience, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then come to CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement claiming his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was captured by the CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to address a judgment committee.
The senator remained immobile looking to the ground while being criticized directly to CNN’s cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say in the hearing of the commission.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event directly hours later, when the Judicial Committee was voting to make Kavanaugh's appointment to continue for a vote at the Senate's plenary session.
However, Flake said it would only do it in understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the appointed for the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake’s choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "doing politician" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “making political” with Britain’s future and harming the national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with which he gave on the first page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Britain and the EU cover the fees of the other party is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims murder: Police holds suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU player’s death
Police arrested a suspect of the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and accused of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the site of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After interrogating Simpson, police reported that Simpson had deadly hit Wayde with firearm.
A $350,000 bail was established, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge’s medical-legal cabinet issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a bullet injury to the head that stretched to the neck.
The department says that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the State Police Criminal Lab, Southern University Police and the area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this detention.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s authorities for their “diligence and effort to obtain justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1.98 m high, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Their average was 5.6 points and 2.6 scores per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us still," Wade said.
Volcano executes ashes in Mexico City
Gray emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Catastrophe Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of the activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shot the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has registered activity since 1994.
Confrontations between Catalan police and separatists prior to the anniversary of vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after confrontations between independentist demonstrators and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing referendum on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, trapped by the intervention police, hit it with eggs and launched powder ink, creating dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Confrontations also took place later, in which the police resorted to the bastones to contend the conflicts.
For a few hours, independentist groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Longa life for Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for light injuries suffered in protests, you can read in local press.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal by Madrid, but was held by the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence overwhelmingly, although the flow to the urns had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote on voting tables spread across the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independentist groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for national police.
Although it was carried out, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electricist who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independentist parties have had difficulties in maintaining the impetus this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention to wait for judgment for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his phone, said the conflict was powered by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained to wait for trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the elections next year.
“Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Detained After Car Battle Against a House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly battled in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m., British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and building itself occurred.
At a certain time, someone may also have fired a beast on the car.
Menga Attack Gives Livingston 1-0 Victory Against Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Goal for Livingston Assured Victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as Ibrox club technician.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level, with Hibernian second.
Gerrard’s team, which continues without a home-out victory in the first division this season, faces Hearts’ leaders with more eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home at the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded to six games to its succession of no defeat confrontations in the division, with chief coach Holt without losing once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against stubborn visitors
The Holt team should have been in advance on the score long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but dropped in front of the beacon, and then Alan Lithgow managed to drive his effort away only after he had stretched to find Craig Halkett's header over the beacon.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the stop ball games.
And that’s how the crucial goal emerged.
Rangers granted a free and Livingston gained an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to pass to Menga, who touched and marked from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and guard Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston stop ball play.
They continued to come crossings to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on the substitute Glenn Middleton and another after one hand, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingston "fenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations in this ascending path.
Their gaming style and staff have little changed since their return to big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for how he galvanised the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
The Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was very much beyond these standards.
Their final game was little inspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is welcomed ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkey and Germany leaders met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose aim was to repair the relationships between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have marked presence in the nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, have also been heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a moving street in Deptford, in the south of the city, near 10.15 a.m., British summer time.
The driver stopped and a relief team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after another cyclist died in a collision leaking at Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
They were placed barriers and deviations for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six wounded agents in disorders
Six prison officers were wounded in disorders in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The disorders, which still continued, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m., British summer time, on Saturday.
Special agents were called "Tornado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a wing.
The agents received treatment of small facial injuries on site.
A spokesman for Prison Services said: “Especially trained teams were used to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received injury treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and must be clear that the names of the officials will be communicated to the police and they can spend more time behind the grids.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called to solve a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Rose Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (areas affected by drought can benefit)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rose hurricane crosses the Southwest Desert, involving the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday to the southern and eastern areas of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rains.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will be able to receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of totals isolated that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the Rose rain can constitute a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods constitute a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," the weather.com reported.
First, the Rosa hurricane will hit the continental mass through the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with wind at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which causes a significant risk of floods.
"Total precipitation was expected 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, being possible maximums of 25 mm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger of Rosa or its remains is the very high precipitation in Lower California, northwest of Sonora, and in the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden, crushed floods of debris in deserts, at risk of life, and allusions in mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detained For Attempt to Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was encountered with cutting gun injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace area near 4:00 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable."
A 17-year-old, two-year-old 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock Area were detained during the night, Avon and Somerset police reported.
The agents appealed to everyone who might have mobile films of the happened that they present.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implacable and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a committee in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, having denied vigorously and emotionally an accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed in the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage that day.”
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legalist with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president laterally referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he talked about the importance of the Republican flow to the urns in intermediate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
"That's why I'm all over fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is planned to take place no later than Friday, a chief assistant of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a big earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dawn, dragging many to death and causing a trace of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, having been victims of the event,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency to reduce the effect of Indonesian disasters (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t move alone: it pulled cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people hit the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and killed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) referred to in a statement that the energy released by the huge decline on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and mentioned that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have fallen down.
Bodies of some victims were found imprisoned under the debris of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely incapable and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities claimed the waves emerged at the time the notice was issued.
In an amateur film released on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frenetic warnings that the tsunami approached, to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water dropped on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive energy cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which has difficulted the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities, however, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although it has managed to reach safely the city of Palu, where employees are hosted in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, Donggala’s World Vision staff have crossed scenes of devastation on their way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when the aid groups started starting the dark tasks of assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared "national catastrophe zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still at the level of provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status doesn’t exist yet.”
After the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a waste.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been detained in the debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed early this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mangagi, were his students.
"As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told that in the hours after the news of Hotel Roa Roa’s downturns began circulating between the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s athletes who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, your messages produced only a grey checkmark rather than a pair of blue.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during automatic cash refilling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who supplied an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "surged to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of involved in the incident.
Anyone who owns information about their identities must contact Newport police via number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Her Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, received Ye's title some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her with “emotional motives,” the spectacle creator said.
At the same time, being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for him a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," West said earlier this year when he commented on the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the only thing,” for only Ye – being merely a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known to Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without lifts and majors.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador pledged not to use military force against civilians at a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
Military fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed himself to supporting Mexican young people by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
US is expected to duplicate financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double research expenditure in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee’s investor and professional, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a global formal strategy in the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Duplicating funding could duplicate the chances of the next major success of AI to be achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested one of the most prominent AI companies in China, a Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of AI that defeated the best ranked American player of Othello, and later performed executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee credited the previous U.S. government’s technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be the next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a huge effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China who is stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired lights from universities to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. push its AI efforts.
"I'm of the opinion that green cards should automatically be granted to AI doctoral," he said.
The Chinese Council of State presented its next generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been advanced for months.
Macedonians vote for referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the shift of the country’s name to “North-Macedonian Republic,” an initiative that would solve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their requests for membership to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which integrates a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbor's name north represents a complaint about its territory and has vetered its entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow on the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote on the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the flow to the urns will be enough to fulfill the 50% necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum's question was: "Is it in favour of entering NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts to bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliament members said it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election committee said there had been no records of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the flow was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote on the referendum on the change of the country’s name, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed seats in front of the tents mounted by those who will boycotch the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to join up head rather than the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO entry will bring very necessary investments to Macedonia, which records a unemployment rate of greater than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are favourable to the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, lower than the necessary flow.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the flow has to be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disappearance in the pro-western government policy since it took possession in May last year.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero crosses Brighton’s entire defense towards goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I kept making it look ridiculously easy on your goal at the 65th minute.
The Advanced Argentine received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He effected a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished a defense before neutralizing others in the race within the boundaries of the great Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's networks with a strike on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is debating some problems in the feet," Pep Guardiola, coach of City, told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in Brighton's territory at this game.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second trail.
The advanced Sky Blues kicked the ball into the network immediately before sliding out of the field boundaries.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies’ lives difficult.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was no many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a leadership of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but some say they’re inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, held a bullpen session on Thursday and launched in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's destro player goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump held committee in Western Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of the Republican flow in intermediate elections.
“Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This is one of the big, big...I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m all over fighting for excellent candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “They’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they’re seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to recover power using all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they strike, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing."
"And they saw this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, sordid, and liars."
The president referred to by the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received soundtracks from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to escape?
Okay, okay, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one - that was even a bad body language - the worst body language I ever saw."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise for me.
In the end, I am the latest of a series of workers in Parliament to whom they were told that they are not welcome - all because we have openly expressed our opinions.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was targeted in similar treatment because he resolved to face anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues with which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Notification for the Nottingham East Working Meeting on the Sixth Holiday mentioned that “we intend that meetings be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as local labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever been implemented.
It became increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable or not by the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took over leadership, as the colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political perspective began to expect from me a twist and to take positions with which I would never agree – whether they are on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and really no matter what I say), it follows a torrent of social media insults that appeal to the “resign,” denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not just myself who goes through this.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are directed to me tend to be of political character.
I am astonished by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never return to them.
One of the aspects that disappoint me most in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we stop being inclusive, and with each “censory” motion or change of selection rules the party narrow its views.
I received numerous advice over the last two years urging myself to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and so "it would be okay" for me.
But that’s not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left my comprehensive school’s classroom literally in debris, I tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as an autarch or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somehow confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who have promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy in the theme of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no threats of “rejection” or political records will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe is the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow envied the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting game of the day’s Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie do Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than us."
Grant Anderson’s 14th minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot taken advantage of an unconverted essay.
Climate extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the middle-time, marked and then converted a soil assay to place the 17-5 marker to the Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well the second part and the essay of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced leadership with a Stafford McDowall essay converted by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted Bruce Colvine essay at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dropping Climate without the ball, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind the Ayr maul in progress.
Climo converted, just as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry wing to the house's fifth team essay.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in restoration business
Ford Kieran, a star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after you know he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with long-standing comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, to be launched soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was planning to engage in the "flower business of Glasgow restoration".
"Sea is ours": Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval base covered with cordame in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is ours by law.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a country without the coast, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sailing once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a sentence of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the pronouncement of the TIJ’s sentence on giant screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favour of their country’s complaint, so that after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, has also much at stake in the sentence of Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the president's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would have little changed even otherwise.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s sentence will be issued only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' belligerant rhetoric has mined some Chilean residual good-voluntary, he suggested.
In the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually quick.
The next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a possibility to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political muleet.
"Bolivia will never exempt its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament unless the country trusts the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never retain its nuclear weapons unless he relys on Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a Singapore summit among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-start nuclear diplomacy in a pace, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that this is an “impossible dream” to consider that the continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a statement that puts an endpoint in the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneeling.
Washington fears to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism as Pyongyang really intended to reduce an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you intend to extend your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look for any more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the gateway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set astonished at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide tab similar to a pen that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry crystals, a witch hat and even an ananas, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time of the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seam.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stilism observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear on the "La Bomba" path, the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very little practical hat that spread across the social networks sent another great creation to pass through: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model in bathing fabric that carried it.
The burned orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia strips and with a white leather pick, was the most outstanding piece of Jacquemus’ spring-summer La Riviera 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I'm waiting for great hats and beach bags to get to the shops next summer. Once the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and searched topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we talk to him in his own tongue, we can enter into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we cannot only depend on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent examinations, we verified that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum ranking of A.
This data, collected at 74 schools under the SCIS headquarters, shows that 72% of students obtained the maximum rating of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now faced in the same way as the STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and not only.
A UK Employment and Competence Commission survey in 2014 concluded that 17% of the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies concerned the shortage of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude to life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a YouGov survey to more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investing in language teaching now is important for today’s children.
The domain of various languages, particularly those in developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding jobs with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the horizon of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages at choice in independent schools, supported by specialized faculty staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future reserves them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication aptitudes".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
We need to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is finishing for fans who want to see LeBron James starting in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will participate in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was surveyed about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game calendar in the pre-season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Youtube Time and Channel of Trump Committee in West Virginia
President Donald Trump launches a round of campaign committees tonight in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
It is the first of five committees scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the formation vote waiting for his chosen for the Supreme Court’s vacancy, Trump aims to strengthen support for the intermediate elections to be held soon, since the Republicans are at risk of losing Congress control after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s committee in Western Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 am, East Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's committee in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearing this week Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, who became tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote scheduled in the Senate will be waiting for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of commitments is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win some impetus.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign officials said these five committees next week are intended to “give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majorities they keep in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is as crucial for the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the campaign season’s agitation,” a spokesman for Trump campaign told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the night logo committee can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media from the Pittsburgh area," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, in disadvantage of polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows it has strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendular oscillation of the impetus is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impetus comes now?
“They had a six-point advantage and are now four, so we’re looking at it as a bit of impetus, I’d say,” said Spieth as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is at the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three in four points.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to green and is leading by the example.
These festive gutural screams were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the 15th match produced in a similar scream, that guy who reveals that he still believes the American team continues in the competition.
"It's just necessary to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That’s all that remains to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple, unlikely but lovely, is four in four and cannot mistake.
The "Moliwood" was the only due to not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players beating on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory to sunrise in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero this morning, when in team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the nine front stabbed the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better in team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day, however, this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with 10-6 leaders on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a free advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday matches with a leadership of 10-6 against the United States.
The duet inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the cargo with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the classification at Le Golf National, so far, four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a missuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series for 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in foursomes with two winning matches, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points on Sunday 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four consecutive points when he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" paper after a sensational weekend, are only the only duet to earn four points in his four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the advantage, defeating an energy-free Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more enphatic 5&4.
Woods, which was drawn for two games on Saturday, revealed occasional access to genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in world ranking.
However, this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of major male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk’s team, the title holder, needs to just empatter to keep the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "not thinking" to unconfident unilateral disarmament
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was aggravating distrust over the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally exclude its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Agency that North Korea had taken "significant good-volume measures" last year, such as the disruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"At all, we don't see any corresponding U.S. answers," he said.
Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our disarmament first.
Although Ri has recycled already known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its statements appear to be significant as they do not reject unilateral denuclearization in contrast to previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between an U.S. president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to obtain a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to smooth the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insist on ‘first denuclearization’ and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to reach its goal in a coercive way, opposing until the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on the knees is an impossible dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader in the United Nations early week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If the interested party in this issue was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea’s rockets towards the U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. President Male” Trump had called Kim the “man of the rockets” in a suicidal mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, filled Kim with praises for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, however claiming that there was a lot to be taken yet and that the sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a calendar for it, saying that “if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions imposed against North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the shore of the UN General Assembly and declared that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although later North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding measures."
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relationships with Washington.
Harvard students attend course teaching them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, on an initiative to fight the machist culture from studying in “direct” caffeine-implemented.
A teacher concluded that students at the top of the world ranking of this university often did not have the least idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for the course arose after having given a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'"
The young woman claimed that no one had ever mentioned her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains the students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee pens, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to gather in bed.
In another section participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know you won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “making directly” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasingly pressure on students makes it a growing problem.
Making sure we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattering, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard in the first year.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate circadian pace and lead to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal overthrows the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sadness access out of home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disliked team a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston stadium.
The Ibrox team was trying to record its first victory in its course since the 1-0 triumph in February in St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving its team eight points behind the unfreasted Hearts, the leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers’ collective, without inspiration, never seemed to be able to equal.
With Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and just behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
And even more problems may arise for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has received treatment of a head injury caused by an apparently shot object from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on his own, used the same Livingston eleven who stole a point from Hearts last week, and has been delighted with how his well-ondured team suffocated the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of a ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored soon at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average wasted his great opportunity out.
A long hit free from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed to just hit out towards the second trail.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly, Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been granted a large hourly quarter penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but Columbia’s arbitrator Steven Thomson refused the appeals.
The Rangers only achieved two stamps in the first part, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly network guard little had to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head stamp and Ovie Ejaria's weak stamp.
Although the Livingston goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, the more it is not for its tenacity.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with a Jacobs long-stop ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange had almost immediate impact when the advanced side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to make a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team might have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor standed well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow took away in the corner.
The substitute for the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he embraced in Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page of our Almanaque "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is 136 years old today and continues to CONTAR ...he was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
Fundamental part of science since then, the accountant Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which unlikely cow scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like an uranium.
When we put these headphones, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now you're really crypting!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention to which the name was given still lasts.
New vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected again into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then reinjected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovary, lungs and also colorretails, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump, spanning a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released in the Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would apply for presidential elections in 2020.
After running his night song, with the name Ghost Town, in which he encapsulated a hat "Make America Great," he started a brave against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I'm talking to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump?' He's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood’s star shared Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual aggression made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the West’s brave scene was published on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West when he did it.
Furthermore, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad bit on the frames because of the hat.
"They intimidated me in the backgrounds.
They told me, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying, "I would pull my superman cover, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments led to the public and SNL participants appeared to be ashamed, he told Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "All the studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of the song I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our most brave spirits: Obligated by encounters of the Turbe."
However, Karen Hunter’s interview show host posted a tweet saying West was simply “to be what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I opted to NOT reward anyone (buying his music or supporting his “arte”) who I believe is welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we also,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the previously known to be Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy’s pasts, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince."
Accusation of attempt to murder after smuggling at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of a murder attempt after a man was stuck in a restaurant in the eastern Belfast area on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be submitted to the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be analyzed by the public ministry.
Star of the Thrones War Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a striker as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, Thrones War.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the machist hero, saying that such roles on the screen make guys often feel hard to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something went wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Thrones War, also 31, admitted that he has a " pretty strong position" about the approach to the problem.
“I have a quite strong personal position right now: what did wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing in terms of the problem we are watching now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he said, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the great issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the Thrones War when the series ended next summer, referring that for him, the "battle camps and horses ended."
As of November, Kit will participate in a True West re-edition by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that went out of the Thrones War.
“I met my wife in this series, so in some way she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the lovely interest of Kit’s character, Jon Snow, in the Emmys award-winning fantasy series.
The couple gave the node in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relationships, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly into some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions derived from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters drops out information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the charges were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
"Lies, lies, and more deprivable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses of the homes and telephone numbers of the Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on charges of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information escape occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published data from a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
"This unfunded charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, has no responsibility for this escape of information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denied is coleric," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she has no temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not your responsibility, he cannot get colerical.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You cannot question the reasons of the accuser.
It has to reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too coerical during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate to dispute the place of Waters in intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he reads on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" for these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally liable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Back to Attack - Weak Espionage Film Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for Brexit connotations in any new British taste movie, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy and action films Johnny English, launched in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satyr on the subject of being so bad is the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetenced Johnny English, with his eyes whipped and an overly elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed once again - with his name to signal, more than everything, that is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-anglophone films.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Claiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Glory Moments" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler and man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his trace.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene when Johnny English approaches a helicopter enlarging a medieval armor, with the rotor's blades to briefly make a railroad noise against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially taking into account that the editions of “serious” movies like the 007s and the Impossible Mission now with confidence propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and, in my opinion, the bizarre disadvantages of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie numbers on Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious trouble.
A computer hacker infiltrated the British super secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for consternation of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, who already suffers a total scale of political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds Theresa May’s character, but the argument doesn’t give much material for large flights.
His secret service advisors inform her that since all the asset agents have been committed, he will have to take someone out of the pension.
And that someone is the disastrous Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but taking unofficial lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, as English offers us an academy of spies in the style of the "School of Rock" movie.
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a striking character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty’s Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously enraged by the charismatic billionaire of technologies who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd disastrous acts: disguised with table employees, ignite a visual French restaurant, create confusion penetrating as clandestines in the luxurious Volta yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as it tries to use virtual reality glasses to get familiar with the interior of Volta house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however more friendly and temperate, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is fairly median.
And just like in other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t stop questioning: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
Labourers lament that they are creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide British a four-day work week, but five-day payment.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to repair the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers, giving them a supplementary day of leave.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keep ordered.
Sources point out that the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic program, which redirects the country in favour of workers.
The passage to a four-day working week obtained the favourable opinion of the Congress of the Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from one day to another, but a four-day working week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to the rebalance of the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the overall party’s strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favored by the entirety of the Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the hands of “faceless directors” and of the “spectators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include not recovering the entire share of current water companies shareholders, since the Labour Party can perform "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conducts.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers in the company’s boards and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who can annually pack dividends that may amount to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 Minutes” if the FBI investigation can do them or cannot change their minds
The FBI’s investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the conclusions can lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that makes them change their minds.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing," he said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I call him after this happened, when this allegation appeared, and I asked him, "You did it?"
He was resolute, determined, unmistakable.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I'm decided about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denied," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will welcome the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people at Central Park’s Great Grass, not only to watch performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness for the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the speakers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to increasing awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of the Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clickativism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen has since 2011 recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to global leaders to announce commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and advertisements resulting from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them already being paid or earned.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people spread around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership gathering investors and implementers committed to "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of subnutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd on a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 pressure actions on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous path - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements for civil rights and anti-apartheid that have previously preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will perform this year’s event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the navy as a "block" to put a barrier to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, namely where the legitimate government’s invitation intervenes, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is to intend to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the stomach south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to make blocks to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
In his intervention, he continued to compare Washington’s approaches to relationships with Russia and Iran, referring that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, lifting and replacing fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “magic of a single trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, attempt to persuade Germany to abandon the “improper” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted by $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply for economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the point of view that energy cannot be an instrument to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (German Industry Federation, BDI), appealed to the US to remain away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for presidency in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will "deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency after intermediate elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would ponder the possibility of applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the top responsible,” the Hill said.
"After November 6, I will deeply analyze the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying “it was taking the country in the wrong direction.”
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal criticism of Trump and his appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that “it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s constituents themselves are not in the opinion that she should apply to the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not be applied, according to the poll at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
32% support their application.
The survey revealed superior support to a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed about a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress in Donald Trump’s committee
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after its listing in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going on, what is going on after I’ve returned, I can identify myself with the other families that feel the branches of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers actually return,” he told the audience of a committee supporting Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "return a little different, return hardened, re-inquiring whether there is this respect for what his companions soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence over a woman and weapon possession while drinking alcohol, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the dispute of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal contesting of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae statement (friends of the court) in Washington on Friday, in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union interposed in August against policy was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but the U.S. authorities denied his asylum request on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum candidates, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed immigrants without documents fleeed from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney-General of the Columbia District Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the prohibition by the police of immigrant entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “avail the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a particular political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, a mother of a male febril baby, by comforting him in an evacuation center in the crushed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-sopped belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who broke the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shocked him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the wall ruins, I think,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife shouting for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread advertising.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid to China Daily at Des Moines Register, the newspaper with more draw from the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 elections to Congress, a denied charge by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with U.S. elections marked the beginning of what U.S. authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the increasing Washington campaign to press China.
Although it is normal foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocking an increasingly intense trade war that saw both sides apply vacancies of tariffs on the imports of the other.
China’s retaliation rates in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting his foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with publishing advertisements in our free press.”
“With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the charming American tradition of freedom of expression and press release by publishing an announcement paid in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
"In contrast, at the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have of the concerning economic trajectory of their country, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not refer to which.
Republicans alienate female voters before intermediate elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analytics warn
At a time when many major Republicans support and defend the appointment for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh against the various charges of sexual aggression, the analysts warn that this may cause a negative reaction, particularly women, during the intermediate elections to take place soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have stated publicly that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no backwards," from The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) to conduct an FBI investigation is sufficient to calm up revolted voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November is at the door!” when they demonstrated in the Senate atrium, since the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all records,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without a party membership.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the undecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual aggression against the nominated for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans advanced with the confirmation.
“This has become a trap for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or about whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, but also about how the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority aligning them with the first one.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% claimed they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation of Ford’s allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to Guardian.
Ford said under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her while drinking alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the appointed for the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when both participated in a party during the period in which both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the open source platform from Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joyfully stated that the intention underlying Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do so now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the personal data store online is that it is exclusively to the user to decide who has access to which type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
Inrupt’s idea, according to CEO of the company John Bruce, is to provide resources, processes, and the appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology makers spread around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all his business models are turned from one day to another.
"We are not asking for permission."
In a publication at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic with this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Tribute to the clergy of Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honoured in his 100-year-old hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained condecoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a shooter four days later and he never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren closed a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his bataljon on the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Canal "a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns."
Then he ran to the fire line and, "with the greatest bravery," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shot three soldiers from the detachement.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s acts were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson of humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a flower crown after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to participate in the stop and added that “the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts awake all night to see the Bellator 206 watch instead at Peppa Porca
Imagine this: Stay awake all night to see the Bellator 206, full of blankets and, in the end, it is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 fights, with six of the main group, and was being displayed directly overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, the UK spectators were amazed when the coverage moved to Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they were awake until early in the morning especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described the shift to the cartoons for children as “a kind of joke of bad taste.”
“The government’s regulation says that content is not suitable for six o’clock, so they had to move to another programming,” said Dave Schwartz, manager with the hail of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Porca Peppa," yes.
Scott Coker, chairman of the Bellator company, said it will rectify the calendar of transmissions to include the UK’s speakers in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning there and we’ll not be able to resolve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday in the British hour.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there was a lot of exchanged messages and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it's been a technical mistake.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise you won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to exceed the expectations of fans and exaggerated.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered the high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he demonstrated in favour of gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that becoming a father made him less worry about winning the Olympics.
The long-term regular host of the program, Kirsty Young, took a several months’ leave due to illness.
Appearing as a paria in the first Laverne program, Daley referred to himself that he felt "lower" to all others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "Until today, this impression of feeling younger and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success."
Their goal was to prove that it was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality earlier or later.
The double Olympic bronze medal became a prominent LGBT activist and used its participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he demonstrated why he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The world champion said in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, “caught me of surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although he claimed that the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When we go through this when we are so young" - his first participation at the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your child has the same name as your father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he got to die and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for the London games in 2012 because he wanted to be in front.
"I couldn't tell you that you're not going to be here to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I was holding him no hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died it was that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games...there was no better sensation," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had been identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs passes on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson under shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th match in a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the 12th biennial event, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of action, as so often he has been in the United States teams, the five times winner of the main men's championships divided the day between the supporter's role and work in his game in the field, hoping to correct what afflicts him.
Having never given the straightest hits even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the countryside of Le Golf National, where the rough long normally punishes the misleading hits.
And if the field itself wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, on Sunday’s ninth match, will face the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who made team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches played for them this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single games, register a good start, Mickelson’s game may be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed trust in his man, but not he could affirm much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a hit on my back, put his arm around me and said I'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of trust in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave immense to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't faced him playing two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of matches played at Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven empates, although Furyk has claimed his presence created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and spirity, likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think younger players had fun to get with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear at a top
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows by experience that his leading leadership on the last single day at the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental tour.
The Danish debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headquartered by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the nose line with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for little," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 Tower victory for 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 in Le Golf National.
So the story has shown me and everyone in this team that this hasn't been over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go there and do it all right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have an objective that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus should remain.
I have always said I focused on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the world’s best players.”
Bjorn added: “I would never make myself lead to it.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the maximum.
This is the message that you need to transmit to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now you’ll leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek his players to perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three in four points.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big turns on the last day, becoming part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" from the cartoon.
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When this impetus is directed to one side, the pressure is very large in these middle games.
We organized our effectiveness accordingly and ordered the players in the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission to attempt to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players by this order because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again delayed
The latest German navy fragate should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time, however, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year due to systems likely to fault and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entry to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the commanding ship of the Baden-Württemberg class's eighty fregates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will be used to replace the aged fregates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-boat missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include extended periods between maintenances, which would allow to send the latest fragatas in missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, continuous delays have made that with the state-of-the-art warships, regarded as a form of Germany designing power beyond borders, will already be unprecedented when they come into service, refers the Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fragate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to Blohm & Voss’s stations in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quote a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, since the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by an crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the required contingent in the oldest fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the navy to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz has twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the whole project, including the formation of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it will have reached a shocking 3.1 billion euros, an increase against 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems that dissolve the latest fragatas have become particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that the German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently leaving without ships capable of being used.
The politician claimed that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were laid out of service without boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the fragates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
National Trust Spies the Secret Life of Mugs
New investigations are being carried out in a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how mud uses the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to influence some light on the behavior of these singular flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common birds and fruit, as well as long-ear brown birds and Daubenton birds at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places spread throughout the property to follow the activities of the mud along the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will assess the frequency of the calls of mud and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of its behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the conservation of the nature of NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat most important for mud and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to maintain forests for birds and associated species.
Population of mutters in Scotland and throughout the UK has decreased considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the bedrooms and cause the habitat to be shortened.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, in conjunction with fly killing papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the birds are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the dam.
It is by them used a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the mud very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspections at the bedrooms and sometimes saves.
It has also come to create the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to mud, in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish mud.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for mud," he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still a lot about the mugs we don’t know, so the work we developed here and in the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish.”
He emphasized the importance of verifying whether there are birds before maintaining properties, as the unintentional destruction of only a maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Mushrooms are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their bedrooms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have a lot to learn about our birds, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are revenging."
Ronaldo dismiss charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized allegations of rape against him as "false news," claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus team was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that it will then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read at Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking directly on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “false news.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the winner of five Golden Balls told the camera.
They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy home and it's okay," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on allegations, which characterized as “an inadmissible report of suspects in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting themselves in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga have allegedly gone to the player’s room, where the player has raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo stood on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he later agreed to enter an extrajudicial agreement for being "terrorised by the perspective of retaliation" and being concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humbled."
The 34-year-old woman now claims he wants to cancel the deal because he remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of alleged aggression. This summer moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would "repent forever" from losing car manufacturers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its world leadership in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary for Companies Greg Clark said.
Clark also pointed out that Toyota in the UK had stated to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that, if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will watch production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts to reach every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on March 29, border disturbances may occur, which the sector says can lead to delays and shortage of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day in stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “accurately calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use of this opportunity for us," BBC Radio 4 told Today.
“The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it was unable to give an estimate of the stop time, Toyota said that, in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates Unite union at this site, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” since there’s still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Trump’s advisors and Russia, and the President’s possible obstruction of justice.
The fact that Trump might be preparing for the fire of the deputy prosecutor-general, thus putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has fed rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the hypothesis of hidden recording the conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then delayed to avoid overlap with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh witnessed and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press adviser Sarah Sanders participated in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “The date has not yet been marked, it can be this week but it can also be delayed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists wouldn’t agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then understood that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding without joining evidence: "We analyzed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is infinitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do this frequently and we saw that we did in recent weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months from the UK departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has committed itself to cover applications for the status of residents of EU citizens working in the country’s decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and decisions were expected for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible departure scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues from all over the EU and other origins bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
The defense of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was undergone an emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday’s defeat by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tigers reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and almost declined," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before living on a map and carrying it for a deeper assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris from the WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no information about the type/gravity of the injury yet” and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, stopped studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after an Illinois transfer.
He made five plaquets on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total season to 18 plaquets.
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing property in the UK
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge higher seal tax to foreign buyers who purchase property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people
The action will neutralize the success of Corbyn campaign to attract the youngest voter
The rise of seal tax will focus on buyers that are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher seal tax fee will be charged to foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people, Theresa May announces today.
The measure is regarded as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the youngest voter, with promises to make accommodation more affordable and rate higher income.
The rise of seal tax will focus on people and companies that are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue to boost the government campaign to offer a ceiling to homeless people.
The surcharge - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and lease purchases - may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are acquired by non-UK residents, making prices rise and making it difficult for first-home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a cut of seal tax to help young people acquire their first housing.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining the prices of high properties when boarding lands that they do not use, calling for Ms. May to leave quotas on affordable housings to solve the "home disgrace" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a set of appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification" discharges.
It also wants to attribute to the widespread municipalities powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that the living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain it is so easy to buy home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning his house has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep in relentless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland”
Coach of Sunderland Jack Ross said his “last ambition” is to become Scotland’s selector.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeast club, currently ranked third in the First League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren in return to the Scottish First Division last time.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only achieved an internationalization B," Ross told the BBC Sportsound program.
“I grew up seeing Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you’re successful in club management.”
Ross’ predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel afraid of succeeding such consecrated names in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success is summarized at the moment to “can I take the club back to the Premier League?”
Considering the club’s structure and facilities, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not easy to take the club back, but I'll only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross’ career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton’s deputy coach and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the downfall to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the title of champion the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a true crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It looks strange because I went well, I won my life as a player and had a few high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face a lot of challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressure of the position, but I feel very well as coach.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt throughout my adult life.”

The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups recorded a 2.7% growth in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin, CGA’s advisor, who compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s career in the World Cup of Football longer than expected, made the June standard, where the pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in sales, repeated in July, but the restaurants found a delay.
The 1.8% drop in restoration sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the drink-based business had far the best performance, with a counterpart growth that more than compensated the decline of restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out to drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, drink sales increased 6.6% over the course of the month, with meals retreating 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst in the RSM recreation and restoration sectors, said: “These results extend the trend we have recorded since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sports events remain the main factors that influence the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual sales drop of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the cost pressure extension.
The long and hot summer could not reach the worst time for operators with the meals-based business. Only the weather will tell if the warmest temperatures we know in August will provide the so desired relief."
The total growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of brand release.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion, being recognized as the industry’s benchmark.
One in five children hides parents secret accounts on social media
One in five children – some only 11 years old – has secret accounts on social media that hides from parents and teachers, a study revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed growth of "false" pages on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "major" account to show parents
One in five children – some only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students claimed to own a “major” account to show parents, simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account discovered that her teenager encouraged others to "violence her."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (HMC), revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said, “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Athletics Voice" in Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and worldwide community of athletics and we are sure Scottish athletics will have much to win with its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute to help guide sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the evidence of 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular BBC commentator, stopped walking after suffering a transitional ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter, “Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only the time would say if it would be able to recover and to what extent.
It has been a harmful job but I reached a total recovery, I learned back to walk, and even do agility exercises!
Thank you for encouraging messages!
Milk Extraction Pump announcement compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk-extraction pump company divided online opinions with an ad comparing cow breastfeeding mothers.
To mark the launch of that which is described as the “first portable silent milk extraction pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic announcement inspired by musical videos to highlight the freedom given by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a vacancy filled with phenomenon at the sound of a song that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I don't have tail" and "If you didn't remember, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refrain continues: "Bomb, pumping, food babies, pumping, pumping, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company’s Facebook page created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the spectators, with many saying it aligns the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“That’s sad decision to use cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discretely within a breastfeeding support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?”
Someone said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted to find the song "hilarying."
“I think the great idea.
If you were still breastfeeding, you would buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy but it makes sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at workplace) and feel like "vacuum."
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women extracting milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly within a breastfeeding support, giving women the freedom to move, pick up their babies, and until they leave home while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, a member and creative director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is so revolutionary that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women extracting milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extract, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, in part because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have hindered children’s deprivation.
Traditionally, most of the “patrons” are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering themselves to steal a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential patrones and other adults who integrate their households would have to record their fingerprints, with data shared with immigration regulators.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior employee of the Immigration and Customs Control Service, witnessed before the Congress that the service holds dozens of people who applied to breeding minors not accompanied.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal history.
“Nearly 80% of patrones or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In seeking to accelerate the processing of children, employees have introduced new rules that require some of them to present themselves in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the rule above, according to the staff of the host centers.
Many are present by video conference, not in person, to defend your request for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be deported promptly.
The longer children remain detained, the greater the likelihood of being anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of host centers and with reports produced by the system in the past few months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo’s, where the large dimension contributes to the ignorance of the signs of disturbance of children.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye from friends worsens the trauma with which many already debate.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
In heading to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country meeting in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that “will be treated as such.”
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, in a war that left millions of people displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to "travest this sacred battle until we release all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by the war.
As for the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for his return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spalting irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
“We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to reconstruct Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major Idlib rebel bastion created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack of the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear times" and expressed hope that military action aims to the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, that they will "be eradicated."
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, claiming that the panel’s work should be limited “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warning against possible interferences.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the contest and scandals finish his pre-presidency in advance.
In that which would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic final of an ever-presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, noble-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million noble-time spectators, a rise against 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
“This is a strong call for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC’s “Designated Survivor” program, on a head of office who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedian veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembers once he called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has value for entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington will be able to determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to migrant family meeting and the health of the global economy.
Changing program is a luxury to which only the most privileged spectators can be given.
And however, it’s more than being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of a debate of experts about Bob Woodward’s use of sources “with deep knowledge” in his book “Fear”, the $15,000 strut leather bluse of Paul Manafort.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he has done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, on Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily turns of the cast (antagonizing with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss any episode or we're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week were 26th on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not distort television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but after all they were right."

Significant external funding in intermediate elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania meets a flow of funding, thanks to a re-alignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race at the same place.
The recent adjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburgh put in the race Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb applies against another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the ancient circles unconstitutionally favor the Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle triggered a hard dispute for the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely disputed extraordinary elections of March for the 18th electoral circle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied over a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump gained the circle for 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, retreating afterwards
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a Panama hotel until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the direction.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama after the “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the State Department in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, who received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalised this Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
With the continued internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year faced as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked by mid-October, a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any tough messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be released could be the report of legal advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, on which there are currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will supposedly guide his investigation to determine whether Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If the Congress changes his hands, Trump will face the responsibility of that body, while preparing to present himself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many chances and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – neither that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnifice that followed.
The course of history turns around inflection points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or cracked.
The Americans currently face several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested to secretly record the President, speculating about his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says The Times' news is incorrect.
“How will we answer if the FBI’s recently requested investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible charges of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a Congress that accounts for Mr. Trump?
If we plunge in these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I think we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at times occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, migrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swasta.
With such an inheritance, how could it not be optimistic towards our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive empate in Spain with the Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in good position to qualify in the European League G Group.
A knee injury prevented medium Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the two-goal match with the Villarreal, but he believes Rangers could use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
“It was a good point gained by us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We looked at the game with a positive mindset and won a point.
Perhaps we could have won near the end, but in global terms, the empath was probably the most fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first part, but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure we will give our best to achieve a positive outcome.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the workouts run well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this saving-reform account
Despite the fact that the participants in the investigation have a clear idea of the kind of care they want to enjoy, few people talked to their relatives about this.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study referred to speaking to their spouses about the cost of continuous care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of himself, but they’re not having this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is how to start.
Talk to your spouse and to your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care if you do not give them to know their desires with the appropriate in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to get care, since these choices can constitute a significant factor in cost determination.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Your financing choices for continuous care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a monetary hybrid policy to help cover such expenses or funding by using your own savings, provided that you have those values available.
Prepare the legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care prosecutor by choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensuring that professionals respect their desires if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a prosecution on its finances.
You should choose someone who trusts to make financial decisions by yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapable.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and finds himself on the way to the hospital.
Would you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“There are not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Shot man multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the 40-year-old house, was in the area of Oxford Grove, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when it was hit in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random action."
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not imply life risk and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the number of dead to increase.
With the interrupted communications, rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends along more than 300 km of coast, northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with a lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian catastrophe management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, leading to a tsunami that dropped on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, along Sumatra, depoleting a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among the people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin’s older son detained for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for accusations of aggression.
29-year-old Palin, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation on domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to denounce alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is preventably detained in the Mat-Su prejudice detention center, subject to a $500 fee, reported to KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself “obviously, innocent,” he reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three A-class crimes, which means he could be sentenced to a penalty of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also accused of a B-class crime, punishable with a prison day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is to be judged by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the allegation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of moving on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating the child’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electrical and communication networks have been cut off, expecting the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake reached the region of Sulawesi Central, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people met for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Sentence for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to run an attack in October, on a cycling road on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the Southern New York Zone.
Both charges can be punished by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor in cases of organized crime, and an charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed him as "atrous, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini’s family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” said in a statement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade the Southern New York Zone has not asked for death penalty for an accusation.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murdering two drug dealerships, but the penalty was switched to perpetual prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was executed after being condemned for conspiracy for committing acts of espionage in favour of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court’s documentation, Uzbekistan’s natural Saipov has demonstrated no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He declared to the investigators feeling well with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He declared himself innocent about all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the charge’s decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for perpetual prison, without possibility of liberation, will only extend the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Deputy says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosetics, while one of Theresa May's members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Rear Conservative Deputy Peter Bone said in Birmingham’s demonstration that the UK “ would have already left” if Farage was the Brexit Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided correligionists was emphasized by the conservatives who defend the remain, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been discussed to maintain its commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of the attacks of Brexit parties, the defenders of remains and the EU.
Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosetics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave committee in Solihull he intended to "finish the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been assigned responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was the responsible, we'd have already left," he said.
Wellingborough said, “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he stated: “We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservices.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their thoughts and intend to remain is completely unexpected."
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular to the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular to our own party and to the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Only prime ministers who know how to maintain promises maintain their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel pressure" if they prepare to betray the 2016 referendum's departure decision.
"This became a matter of confidence between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that they're not going to get out of it."
He addressed the excited crowd, he added: "I want to pressure our political class, which is on the edge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud UK that governs itself."
Meanwhile, the advocates of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour committee in the city center.
A crowd of activists stamped tracks with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was released this weekend.
The representative of the Workers at the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for security issues they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the congress.
“These are those people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada more’, to the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously sponsor" eventual candidate to President
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "seriously hold presidential candidate" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe news that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-mandatory of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that Trump will be able to face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s ownership.
One of the participants asked him whether he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman in the top place.
Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced a suspect arrest on Saturday in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims’ murder on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was killed near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, following which he was finally dead," police chief Murphy J. Paul told journalists on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the site, holding a gun, recognizing that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the police office of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was holding 10 times last time, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 retrievals per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and caused Hamilton to face the end traffic of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes a round later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a relentless smuggling, after which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was at the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, exchanging tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxes on the 44th round but failed to improve his pace in the last eight rounds, which allowed Raikkonen to end in bedroom.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman, leaving me out of it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to end in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Poor Body Language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Sen. Dianne Feinstein on a committee on Saturday due to her insistence that she has not revealed a letter by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a committee in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead that what happens in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false."
“See the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, see the anger, see how bad people are, malicious, and false,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks of information and the communications and when we say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, the escape broke from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you reveal the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn’t come from me.”
Well, wait there.
The escape came from us... No, we weren't," she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges sent by Ford against Kavanaugh in July and the escape took place in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected your request."
But his dismissal did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night committee: "You know that more, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the nominated for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favour.
“They are determined to resume power by recurring to all means.
We see evil, evil, no matter who they can hit, who have to step to take over power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals by Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from the defeat on Friday in the First Division match against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial advantage of two goals with strips from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie hit the house team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard hit Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald goals to guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a twist on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, having the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal appeared in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier to increase the advantage four minutes later.
In the first frenetic period, Sullivan again placed the house team in the match at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the empate at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to reach the first interval in leadership, scoring their second night goal at the end of the first period.
The house’s team reorganized and Bouchard empattered again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing the victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, received Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been acclaimed as a hero after death in ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers drops safely.
More than 800 people died and many continue to disappear after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to destroy the region, leaving many residents buried in the debris in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues have fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower squared violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained concentrated to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was then on the track, dropped safely.
He then jumped from the control tower in front of the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated with this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we still cannot rescue,” said Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are carrying aid and food to the site.
Laugh Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
Mini-markets are being stacked everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations, are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Airplane drops in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man missing after a plane drop in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane dropped in a lacune in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the plane to sink.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon it was unable to confirm the location of a male passenger.
The company said it was working with hospitals, researchers, and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane was painted in the water when trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable clinical frame.
It is not yet known what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous to state that the plane failed to reach the track and yellowed in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone out of the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
"It was the best thing that happened," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the waist and reach the emergency outputs of the plane dropping.
He told that the board assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small injury to the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, the sailors who were working on a work of improvement of a nearby wet also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinking at 30 feet (100 feet) depth.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of night events when a woman was burned alive
The accusation concluded her allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in the Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstitute the movements of the 20-year-old accused Quintom Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that confirm Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made before.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked if Tellis was telling the truth as he claimed he was in his truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the truck was in Nashville.
Another incongruence in Tellis’s testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they only met one another a week ago.
Rowlett said, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"You destroyed her from her life," Hale said.
The defense will begin to file its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial will begin to be analyzed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Conscious?
A trio of the hip hop wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed group claims that the hip hop has diverted from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York Lady prosecutes couple for dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A lady from New York is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having mistakenly received a SMS from the mother to complain that it was "a more black."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the process was an act of “extorsion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, demonstrated some fear when she discovered that new girlfriend Giselle Maurice was black when she appeared for her first working day in 2016.
"I can't create a black one," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gap, a "shocked" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous African-American lady and she was waiting for a Philippine lady.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple and applying for a $350/day dismissal compensation for the six-month period for which he had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be impunished," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that fire Giselle was perfectly logical because they were afraid not to be able to trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent her something that I actually didn’t want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
Would your children trust someone who had treated wrong?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe."
In calling the “extorsion” process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother just two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to pursue someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment bankier added.
While the legal proceedings take place, the public opinion court was quickly condemning the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a speaking bear.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said the letter: “It’s hard to porn on the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know this now, after Paddington was so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear of playing to write the child's book, wouldn't have taken to chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a sharp taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as “a very important member of our family,” said that his father was very proud of success.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to the boast,” he said.
“But as Paddington was so real for him, it was like having a successful child: we’re proud even when it’s not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling a friend to say that the situation was really bad and there was no chance to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye from her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart running were slowly stoping effecting and leaving her system.
He had died some time ago and all his organs were stopped.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or regret me because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning for the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane along with other trial passengers why she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
"I've always shot low head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved you."
Mourning women fix bridge cards to avoid suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who suicide struggle to prevent others from going the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached cards on a Wales bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old and resident in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it was lighting the room."
However, he abandoned the work before he died because he had "dipped into the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I am always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posts so that they know that there are people available to help and whom they can talk to, even if they are a friend.
Do not close yourselves, you have to speak."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Sharon Davis, has lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, very shortly after his mother-in-law's death.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in their behavior.
When the kids opened the gifts, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death has traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to go beyond: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms of similarity to what I asked for - a defined time and scope investigation - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, fearing the committee would "fall down" in the face of a rooted partial impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your reluctance is a merely temporal issue.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their Supreme Court candidate frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and through whom he met the wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to launch the vote of decomposition and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea deserts decreases during Kim’s regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserts to North Korea has decreased since the rise to Kim Jong-un’s power seven years ago.
In citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that the rigorous border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people’s smugglers would ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statement.
In general, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserts.
Soul revealed that more than 30,000 North Koreans passed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Korea.
China considers desertors to be illegal migrants and not refugees, and it is often to return them.
Relationships between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are on an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general lines, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Ministers Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances it is impossible to be ourselves to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman behaved like this, it would soon be called hysteric," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all legations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in striking and solvent voice, talking about his family and the high school years.
He also explicitly accused the commission's Democrats, calling the allegations made against himself of "grotestic and conspiracy assassination" organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton losing presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudicial behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to dispute Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, it doesn't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, nor even to serve in its current court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Relationship of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democratic, he feared Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (best known as Obamacare) or the case Roe vs Wade, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh contourned questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiceful to the Supreme Court and hope we're happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women have to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of anger to overflow, and can't disappear without crying.
"We cry when we were angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something strange, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me she also cryed when I was angry, but she had created a technique. When I was angry and started crying, she told the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it was still.
And I thought for myself... it's brilliant," Mrs. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because in a more common context they are misinterpreted.
I perfectly remember, in an old job in a office dominated by men in which I crying of inexpressible anger, being gripped by the neck by a older woman - a no-friendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say.
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be pleased that they managed to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, Colorado’s Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidate to the presidential.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was captured in an extraconjugal relationship on board a ship called Monkey Business and resigned from the application, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn’t see why she couldn’t apply herself to the presidential.
"It wasn't a very weighted decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the "Snow White and the Seven Drinks" situation.
Given his late entry, the fundraising was beyond the desirable and swore that he would only enter the race if he could earn $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his supporters would only give him $250, though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
“Would you think I have the right to a discount?” he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the top - thanks for the people who had supported it, frustration with a system that lifts so many obstacles to fundraising and brings the message to voters, instead of delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Until it seemed to be depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder as he talked about the media reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaphy?
"She cryed?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first saving of the trade war between the U.S. and China was insurgency, and although the end of the conflict is not seen, in the perspective of experts, the displacement of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was stage of a significant aggravation of the situation with the new taxes to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taking in fact half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to following the U.S. steps and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will go vacuum in the coming times.
Making Washington back would mean suffering to the demands, but showing a public service to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trunfos, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that a timeless political decision from Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher devoted to the study at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for refugee return
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a devastated country for more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilite the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive aid to the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He noted, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Selection beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National surrounding Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is again winning after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who demonstrated having serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, hit the starting tee to the water in the hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari brightened all of his rounds, making himself 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst ranked player of the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best ranked player, has lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England in which he might have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European in all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't stop.
It was a tough year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for having chosen me and believed in me.
I'm immensely happy to have won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He gives the word to his compatriota Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the U.S. Gulf, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing him playing," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
Ungular statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 big titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-quality performance during the entire tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection discussed for reaching the fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance.
This tomorrow, we can get some fear in Europe.
We've demonstrated fight.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were great.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I am proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat from the other team.
They were better."
