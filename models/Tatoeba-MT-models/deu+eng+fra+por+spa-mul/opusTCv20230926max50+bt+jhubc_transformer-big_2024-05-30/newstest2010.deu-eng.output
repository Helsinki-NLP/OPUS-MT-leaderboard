Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. President
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth U.S. President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House comes tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northern Vegan metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony where Obama takes over the premium.
He receives it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when the prize was taken.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he takes the award as a president who currently leads war in two countries.
He reinforced the war efforts a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama also received the Gol medal, diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then provides a bank with the President and his wife, where except Norway’s King and Queen will also be present the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests.
Obama was very retarded to the prize from the beginning.
He said he felt he doesn’t deserve the price.
He also repeated that it is not only the price for him, but for those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he found that this is "invitation to act" for him.
Nature Protector is accused of expression
The Leitmeritz-Policei accused the Chairman of the Citizen's Association "Natural Protection Community Leitmeritz" of depression.
In several cases he launched appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from investors in his favour, Leadership Police Speaker Alena Romova said.
Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he threatens a prison sentence of up to three years.
Sorting fuel containers in Brno smell not good
In Prague, people can sort the drink packaging, in the Southern Morocco villages you can find again step by step and trip the Sorting waste containers.
What about Brno?
There you need to book a few minutes to find the suitable garbage tons.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it is my opinion that the councillors are insufficiently taking care of this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste breaks in the Urwald League, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to discharge only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but especially due to the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have you sometime tried to remove the PET bottles in a collection basket in the center, for example?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only spot I have found until now randomly is the father's place in front of the affected Gans.
Mr Onderka let us not be upset by his colleagues, but this is too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey crack in other parts either.
Therefore, all my friends rather don’t sort the waste.
From faulty.
They are too far to the garbage tons.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to remove a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn’t see any color waste tones in a visual range.
Luckily, I came to the right spot on tram driving.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the entire city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics likely leaves the Brno socialists cold.
You rather buy the city an ice hockey liga that makes us embarrassment throughout the republic instead of buying a few more garbage tons and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire Southern Morocco district.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn money for pensions and health funds
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health funds and construction savings.
But not for the public debt rates or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected that the government will additionally pay the money for sensitive spending, age pensions, or for sickness money. "This is just a decrease of problems in the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The loans are paid ever higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from where to take, the state cash is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the government are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all whom the left party now gave more money: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later for her children too.
To get the pensions or health funds from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid that they get that money.
But with the price that the state is indebted even more - next year, the state fund will not only be missing 163 billion, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and, together with him, also costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise VAT only slightly or cut the maternity money, as the government made in its area efficiency package.
Due to the money abduction in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing to expand highways and railways next year.
These are mainly the sections gained in the competition, which cannot be re-projected and possibly confused.
Get the highest, which is not free either.
This means delay or adjustment of thirty large buildings, also at risk of Europe money creation, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, warns.
The CSSD has suggested that it will solve the flow of money in Salmon - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends in which the state owns the majority, and from them then the money will be spread into the transport funds.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it is not anyway an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ came to the budget.
Annually, the dividend pays the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is filled up and this money is also a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the snow of 5.7% GDP.
However, the carnival of the changes does not end yet.
Nearly three billion dollars declined the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and offences or expenses for the disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state will manage without this money is not sure.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay that anyway, Janota clears.
The Minister must then save money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million lack also for the already started two billion State Cash project, which is intended to allow on-line monitoring for what individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a mobile phone where the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It’s enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will be switching Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly the possibility that the American company wants to imagine VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti said at VMware’s interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will come to the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM storage of 128 MB, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems run simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full capacity.
Now VMware works with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the customers are expected to come the devices within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owners hurt
Scneelose tracks are not just worried about the giant mountain residents.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and bed and breakfasts.
Therefore, you can still receive free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Years.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when you call us, you immediately ask whether we think this year’s Christmas holiday will be on snow or “on mats,” the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, directed.
Whoever wants the New Year’s stay in the spindle mill precisely according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer the savings and where the quality of the stay only comes to the second place can try to wait for a few days.
The Spindle Mill Hotel Owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year’s Day.
I think they’re going to strive for a while to sell them, but then they’ll also have to give up, and come into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates are always offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week that has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last moment, director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, led.
The New Year’s Day in Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by no snow in Giant Mountains.
People wait if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowing within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely and a little better than last year, it succeeds in occupying the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On Christmas and New Year’s Day we have just a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, said the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80% for the New Year’s holidays, Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking place in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds will still be free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
This year we were surprised by January, for which we are already occupied by about 60%.
A little weaker is now in February, but when the snow comes, interest will certainly also rise in the stays in the Giant Mountains, said the hotel’s director, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the giant Mountain Hotel Owners are waiting for a greater snowfishing.
On Thursday it should cool and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards heating is to come again, Jiri Jakubsky reported from the Czech Weather Office location in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of cleverness
It’s almost strange, with what student effort Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he even considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated his desired Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it from the Bush Iraqi scenario three years ago via the copy paper.
Not only does he use the speech in the text himself several times "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Path forward" without deterring.
Three years ago, he also criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quota in the Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "unresponsible and in its consequences a catastrophic decision."
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy coming out of the military recommendations was the only possible and to the extent that we no longer talk about Iraq in the news today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the troop contingent, the military once again asked him, especially the senior commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the habits of subordination hardly criticised the dug shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation to the better.
The President hesitated three months, but has not come to a better idea, and thus he deceived the General of Wenist by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
His plan is to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the semi-creased increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brother’s war in recent years, Iraq’s society has been relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally correctly founded, remain only visible buildings behind which the patriarchal core relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inexperienced conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The construction of a "actible state", which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizons of Obama’s strategy outraged by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the edge of the explosion.
Believing in this that the small soldiers who have broken out into the war cries about the “free home return” can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political perspective, the date for the troop withdrawal is purely unresponsible because the Taliban will take up the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The latter NATO Summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the Afghanistan fights is near.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindukush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States is a very serious question whether the problem would not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America goes to Obama for the retreat of victory from Afghanistan.
Each solution will, however, also mean a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation blaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years before the presidential election remains, and therefore remains enough time for him to reach another strategy, if this would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash
The chief executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive prize bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers in the trap if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the efforts to connect Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go, the former JPMorgan bank officer, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had put aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over this year will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure shown today, according to Reuters.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it is intended to burden the bankers’ bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm have taken the Nobel prizes this year from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, German writer Herta Müller, among them, was a Romanian origin.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the Chromosone area.
Israeli Ada Jonath received the prize for chemistry together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the enlightenment of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the Economic Report.
The only specialty category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for glass fiber research and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, took this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax equipment, or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and certificate on the acquisition of the money prize.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided below them.
Traditionally, the American President Barak Obama has received the most expected Nobel peace prize in Oslo today.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and besides, stands at the top of the country which leads two wars – in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in keeping with his policy he supplemented that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fighting of world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes Finance Minister Eduard Janota early Friday, who thinks about his remaining in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the next year’s state budget in the form that was released by the Member Assembly on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed of the meeting.
On Monday, Janota will negotiate with Premier Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should economy with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals for the movement of money were voted and increased money for the officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that they covered increased budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party, on the other, therefore emerged a sharp internal political dispute, because of which the questions arise about the further work of the Fisher Office Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of savings measures that were implemented by the fisherman’s government in the autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State budget law but doesn’t have to, today, at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs, explained that the politicians have neglected the “great problem” that represents the “inconsistent deficit” of public finances for a long time.
According to him, there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget was terrible, and the government should consider its further existence.
ODS Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial, Premier Fischer called similar words “strong claims.”
The CSSD chief Jiri Paroubek responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was terrifying that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows a lot of the country, of which struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and about Nelson Mandela.
The tired fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and her first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Another meaningful role takes over Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'm going to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he has finally become a slaveholder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Allpower", but rarely someone is living for many people.
The former South African stateman was in prison for his active activity in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was placed on foot in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film shows a true event where Nelson Mandela gathered his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically shared even after apartheid.
He believes he can agree to his people through the sport, so he decides to agree to the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises until the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than playing this role in order to approach it as narrowly as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him to dinner and be behind the scenes before his talk.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela his hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transferred, and I felt I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have overweighted.
The actor said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded the door ring that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look much bigger in the movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the leadership of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects of an Oscar.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well performed movie."
In the movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive assessments.
Dissolved light secret about Norway: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only agreed yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was unsuccessful again and the missile called "Bulava", which originally should be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket tests also had no positive effect on the success of the trial flights.
Bulava has usually not started or damaged in the air at all.
In Russian newspapers, it is already written about “Bulava” as about a “missile that doesn’t fly.”
A missile that doesn’t fly but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, technical damage to the missile occurred.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which led under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the shot out of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light on northern routes caused by an undetermined flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has retained itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although no test launch was made without errors, the Department of Defense only sees six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear heads with a total weight of max.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov, at the age of 51, presents himself in a professional Irishockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympic Winner and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow in trouble, and probably already takes place in the Friday Dual KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect a game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other players, co-player Nemcinov introduced.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes after AP the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary stormman Gordie Howe, at fifty-one-year-old, played a whole season for Hartford and was able to benefit himself with 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union Dress he won two Olympic Gold Medals, seven World Championships, and he also won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice above his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai left the trade unions. All overhours are removed
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union to withdraw all overhours.
Because often arranged overhours, the union announced the willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management will agree with the trade unions over a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overhours were proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on the Saturday layer.
The employees will also receive it afterwards for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overhours.
Either they can be paid for the overhour supplement or they can take the replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek launched.
Furthermore, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid for the cash and lunch.
Considering that the overhours of the most urgent and burning point concerning the demands and complaints of the trade unions who had ceased production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overhours for December, Vanük introduced.
The employees of the Automobile Factory were forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour layer yet two overhours until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they can agree to fulfill the claims and sign a common document, they will be ready to remove the strike willingness.
The location at the automotive factory last week, on Wednesday, went on when approximately 400 employees strike spontaneously due to constant overhours.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged shikans.
The management said employees had to make overhours to comply with the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unions also requested that the employees who interrupted production on Wednesday did not have any sanctions.
In the area of overhours, trade unions demand to reduce overhour work to a minimum.
In addition, this year, they demand the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was launched in the company last November.
Until this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with the current manufacturing capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on “stained” HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact is overwhelming against the disadvantage that the compound on usual virus variants does not work as strong as one of the already existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, the patient can extend life and prevent the multiplication of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of resistant viruses against which no drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the CR Academy of Sciences, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarboranes are active on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus multiplication in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists reach new "improved" compounds, prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metalocarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two varied cages consisting of bor, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homemade and resistant virus
HIV protease is HIV virus protein, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the multiplication of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe entire rows of compounds in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, including its consistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however, it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metallocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Dispute about budget. ODS started on fishermen who stopped
Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "gray" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider their further existence.
The statement of the SDGs referred to the Prime Minister as "strong claims".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether it comes to his remain in the office using the Parliament's lefts.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas said.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with Link Party amendments proposals over more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the money for official salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The Government has prevented the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should economy with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The SDG has left the room before the vote, so it has met the government's desire, because also the changed budget is just a less bad variant of the budget provision.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota registered for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
He suggested that he considered his further remaining in office.
This is the reason for his disappointment about the disruption of the budget.
To what extent fishermen speak for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominators of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will withdraw if the Parliament continues to accept deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning health and pensions or the new laws of service.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not mistake
This is the matter of the prime fisherman and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, people sitting in deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to refrain from the fight against the deficit high of public finances, "it is completely logical and accurate that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he supposedly cannot expect the support and tolerance of the Citizen Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and if this will be current, then I’m going to deal with it, the Citizen Democrats-nominated Minister of Defense Martin Bartak told the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council meeting.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas emphasized that the SDGs would likely vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask Citizen Democrats' members to allow them to adopt the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, so he then replied to the question of whether the ODS was not repelled in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the President of the Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be especially about bolshevizing Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway) less trains will drive for approximately the same price.
The Czech railway ends or limits some less loaded fast and local trains from December 13, while other connections are reinforced.
The entire traffic range is reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer driving fares are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, receive the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway operates trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The quick train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less quick trains are also taken on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, and direct trains from Prague to Letohrad are generally reduced.
The biggest reduction plans the railroad in the Hradec Kralove district, a total of 8%, can be expected to increase Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and to a few days a week, the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis will be reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct traffic route from Milovice to Prague, while currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the fifteenth traffic route of the suburb traffic system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance distances to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive at the distance of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers have no longer been able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's bill for regional railways: increased by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the overall railroad receives for the so-called liquidity loss next year four billion crowns, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, overall they pay for this next year eight billion crowns, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and quick trains, the railway has re-enrolled a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been enrolled for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps therefore it has not seized to increase prices in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes only occur on one-day CD Net tickets and cheap eLiska internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Million people today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which initially only informed about 65 kidnapped people.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The abduction occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 million people allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when they escaped from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to issue the remaining hostage.
According to the Agency AFP, the militants belong to the New Volks Army (NPA), this is the weapons fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers for the violence calling for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election to the Governor’s office, there were 30 journalists.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Phillippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On Mindanao island, Muslim separatists are also active.
But those who on Tuesday resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
South Africa’s story affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the American movies "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of former President of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The legendary South African champion's role in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
The film’s movie’s movie show is also reacting to critics as well as to the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 along with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas in a time in which South Africa, on the one hand, culminates the preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media shake the world with frightening news about the rising race hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants on the side of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new movie in South Africa are formerly positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new movie, according to his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I can receive his energy, as one says, he launched in the interview after the Los Angeles film’s festival premiere.
I think it’s good if we can handle the personality of Mandela and his message with this movie.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Teams
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives throughout the film to bring together two groups of races and for the years and day, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African National Rugbydress to the World Cupfield that South Africa won at the time.
For the entry of the grass in the dress, which applies almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly by the white audience, winning the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may take it to bring people together to a single people in turn, rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the expected situation in South Africa is improved, that will only show up.
The white South Africans are however skeptical, such as in recent interview for LN of the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformator of the Ceps company in the switching system at Vyskov municipality in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the District Fire Defence Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, the fire attacked six units.
Originally the firefighters wanted to burn the transformators, but later she changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-inner shortcut.
No one was injured, the avaria has not been threatened, according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the line system.
The damage has been estimated to be several 10 million crowns, and the damage will not be accurately figured until after the burn.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, it added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the Northern Bohemia company spokesman of CEZ, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trap station did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech area as a single operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates, and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which electrical energy is transmitted into distribution system and line lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura charges criminal charges for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The Student Agency’s owner, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal prosecution for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Morocco, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leads attack us and say that we take the rosins out, while we only submitted the offer over the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
Therefore, nothing else remains to us but to defend us.
Because of this delusion of the Student Agency company, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he indicated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the commissioning of the criminal charge for the continued media show of Jancura, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call for further leads.
I assume that even in this matter it will be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway traffic and uses liars and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas, and continue the campaign after New Year.
He precised that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railway with the Czech railway and had no tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such a behavior is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he threatened, according to Jancura, even a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not give up that we can also lose the bus licenses.
He imagined himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumokoks free and voluntary
Inflation against pneumococcus changes the habit from January.
She is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But now, votes report that the vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcus vaccination culminate.
The Drug Institute already determines the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance needs to pay.
The professionals are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August Children
As of January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition st that you have not received vaccine dose yet.
Those who have started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further vaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the child’s 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of young children, four doses are required.
Overall, the professionals estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for the vaccination doses.
But you save in the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent approximately 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcus infections die from us in hospitals per year after examination, up to 28 children up to 10 years of age.
Outside Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococcus was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be a duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, the insurance will be paid and voluntary.
That the duty-vaccination would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the citizen association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association is already promoting pneumococcus vaccination in the long run.
The professionals at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with having voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we managed to make at least that.
I think that's the way we need to go now," Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
The chairman of the company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of repeating vaccines: "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Professionals expect more than 80% of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also basic in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
Doctors have to purchase the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern associated with practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the initial project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines expenditured to them by the State.
However, some members were afraid that the insurances could “execute the money from the health insurance providers.”
Therefore, doctors will have to purchase the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pay them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns a month, which is a significant sum.
That’s not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken with trailers when inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used an excavator to enter the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of figures such as Conan of Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family defeat.
The agency reported, according to a police sworn statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father to "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior dismissed to have granted any permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, economics and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have left an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also under shooting that he aimed at workers with low and medium income.
Its main suggestions include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1 percent capping limit in public wage accounts for 2011.
Social Insurance
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low wages receivers will be punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned for upcoming "problems".
The increase in social insurance – to approximately 3 billion UK pounds a year – has angryed the private sector, which says that this is a job tax, although the focus should be on the economic rise.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
SCHWERPUNKTS OF THE PREAB STATE REPORTS
Increase of social insurance by 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is declined by more than expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Control discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of State pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the Treasure Office, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorest for £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorest for £190, while a person with £10,000 per year income will be richer for £110.
The ministers said their goal of deficit halving by 2013 meant "tough decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be 5% of top earnings.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the sketched tax increases and spending stops would be “a drop on the hot stone” compared to the necessary measures.
“These are big numbers, they’re going to bring us the deficit decrease and this is absolutely necessary for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
Predictions of the Labour Party about future economic growth – which affects the extent of redebt and the speed of deficit deduction – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise earlier numbers.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably decline by 4.75 percent this year - far more than the decline predicted in April by 3.5 percent - while the debt of £3 billion would be higher than previously expected.
"Missed opportunity"
The conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn from Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be unavailable.
They added that the ministers have failed to introduce a credible plan on how to repay this and push themselves "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond said. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
“The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever they win.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour continues to ensure that schools, hospitals and police will be preserved from future cuts, unlike the suggestions of the conservatives that will see the deficit capture come faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand".
BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson said some at the time of announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalid pensions next April – would suspend the Treasury Chancellor to the charge of voting as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Holler State"
Although the ministers have not announced state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only take place in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Examinations said the numbers of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong breakdowns in many areas, possibly in the future even in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"It only moves the pain to later," his director Robert Chote said.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever it wins," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor at Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-estate report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates “U.S. citizens’ captures in Pakistan”
The FBI investigates the arrest of five U.S. citizens reported because of the suspect of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault of a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it will be investigated whether they are the same men reported as missing in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemenitic background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the accusations they are accused and under what circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in connection with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused foreign minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but said that the U.S. must work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eliminating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students were reported missing at the end of November by their families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns “miss customs” in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization, Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected its former human rights balance sheet.
Officials said that such criticism is politically motivated.
After the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentence and accusers said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak criminal institution.
But since then there was no tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
“They beat me in the face often,” he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted abuse took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said he had been arrested in a container in a criminal facility in Kahrizak with more than eight weeks with 75 others.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would have been unclear and the results gained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said at least 90 people were arrested over the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was furnished in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark in Bristol into a race track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the hill mountain in the Brandon Hill park, there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100 meter long hill.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also very terrifying.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added, "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices have been awarded for the best artworks - or tricks performed on the hill.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban for minaret and the concern is widespread about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated and integrated into one of Europe’s most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the author’s last work: “Why the French don’t love head towels” (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a question that shared and busy the country over a decade and a half and its effects are perceived even today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, now offering the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces".
He is a good listener, he returns to debates between teachers and students about the issues that worries them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a bank-oriented system to get a mortgage?
They are these apparently profane affairs, he claims, which make up daily life, unlike the political dramas that the media dealt with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation attempts to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and on the other a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are mistrustful to the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who surveyed Bowen are mostly uncontrolled with their salafi pieces – defenders of Purist Sunni Islam, which is connected with Saudi Arabia – which today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions, to what extent French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so passionately guards the separation of church and state) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims might experience rigid treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in their part, had to make their historical compromise with Secular Republicanism.
He recognizes rather a "exacerbation of value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The Most Trostless View in the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that she characterizes melts at alarming speed and takes life with herself, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the latest open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their Kielwater.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the ice bear.
Immigrating into the complicated history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who proved themselves in hunting ice bears.
Admiral Nelson’s meeting with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old father to the lake, who fighted only with the pistol of his musketes, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were captured when they sweamed behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circus.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an imagination.
Even today, zoo plants still typically possess a millionth of the area of life of a wild old man. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore has been fully green from the algae that grow in the hot hairs of his skin.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the landing goes on in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful Inuit helicopters and motor-sliding storm guns to bring their prey to the path.
Ironicly, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and troubling description of the science of the Arctic and an impressive insight into how the future could evolve.
Not for example, scientists have all answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.

Marine infantists were among the 6,000 who laid down crown in Arlington
The upper-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never hit.
For him and the other marine infantists who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they went.
In a few months, from wherever we are returned, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show that my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs on the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an eighteen-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who are making this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (crowns across America), which also extended the event to other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers laid crowns on the tombs at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville's National Friedhof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airline Flight 93 memory site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated for the second time more than $150,000 for buying and transporting the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return to the victims.
She said that is a small contribution to supporting our civilians.
It's like visiting a family burial site.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked across the wide-ranging grass surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not as often visited as the newer graves, the organizers say.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held on their hands while carrying the fresh pig branches to the grey grave stones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
Section 60, located nearby and where veterans of wars are buried mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the dark mood of current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cryed openly, others prayed and families and friends stayed in the ice air.
Some read the names whipped in stone, while others fell down to small black-white maps, which were placed in the wet sludge for those whose grave stones had not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who burnt bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She was eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrastructure Under-Office David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’ve been no longer, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebooks in the country, representatives of the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Authority for International Development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. stakeholders in Havana attempt to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special accusations have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of the "danger".
All so-called contrarrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical scriptures, are at risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are tracked and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorization to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro-Bruder in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relationships with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will make a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average worth of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to purchase a mobile phone since this year, they are used to send text messages, since a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are sitting behind grids for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba brother, the official of the country's leader Fio.
Vivanco said the accused would often be arrested, convicted and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move for more dialogue readiness.
Pakistani Government Representatives Cover Plan to Send Men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hoped that this case could help discover an extensive network of terrorist candidates searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had been looking for an unclear insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them had given comments on terror attacks on the YouTube video site.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah was the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote territory in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was unable to convince al-Qaeda leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermigration the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the unusual mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge site.
They were viewed as part of a hidden operation.
That’s why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more importantly in deciding who is trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence service has made it an urgency to accommodate human active posts within Al-Qaeda.
The organization’s applicants act as porters who do not allow in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American wishing recruits are subjected to special examination by A Kaida, analytics said.
Due to their potential access to U.S. goals and their propaganda values, they are also considered hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation’s highest analyst, said terrorist groups have become much more careful in recent years in terms of whom they have allowed access, as U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
When trying to insert someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now based on the internet much more.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand in Copenhagen Climate-"Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded dangerous action on climate protection from negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than about 25,000.
The event went relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the climate negotiations supported by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparents, where in English, “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish, declared “The Earth says “It’s enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s birth country, made her aware of what hearty problems the country has to fight because of the already notable impacts of climate change.
"This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to transmit the word and call for the world leaders to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," she said.
It’s not a easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no way more to drive around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be called, as he was involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes ignited several explosives near the main Copenhagen Channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as lighting missiles, but then followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, Chinese Chief Climate Dealers.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international thoughts, he answered in English: "This is something I didn't know."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the broad public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Examination data shows stainful race air
The testimony on mathematics performance was welcomed last week good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools in the country, the testimony shows that the fourth and eightth classers have made progress in the last two years faster than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the hardship of performance between African American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of white fourth classers from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 over the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their African-American partners only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, performance air increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-class remained basically the same, he fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample range was not large enough.
The image over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth classers in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that the children of both groups have reached has grown in this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some educational supporters of the district expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven for the most part by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group entering for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I don’t jump up and down for a range of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Basin School.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of examination points is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What fears me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak powerful students.
For example, this autumn, some teachers are trained to use a new reading schedule, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of the primary school and middle school, which basic reading skills have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and the significant behind their equal-classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on from kindergarten to sixth class games and true experiences, has been brought to Washington under former chief school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NAEP progress reported last week will be attributed to this curriculum.
I mean, we need to keep working to make the best measures benefit students below the rating level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while still providing additional money and resources for the weak performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, studying urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could cause political repercussions that work against this important agenda point.
The weakness, of course, is, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can obtain excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance airport is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teacher union last year, which he considered as “a mileage stone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future perspective
The travel bus reachs the Gettysburg college with a sound pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, goes out and blinds a moment when she looks at the white pillars, the brick facades and the smaragd-green grass.
Graciela’s parents hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lived in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the attitude of the other eight classmen of the group exploring Gettysburg where the classes cost $38,690 per year was rather the one of a fearful visitor than the one of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I'm going to be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported the school's low teacher-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is an increasing concern about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States who do not end or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these “second generations” of Hispanic Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigrant parents, usually from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workers.
Those who investigate powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inhabiting drive to success.
Many of them also have parents setting their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence with American schools.
But advisory programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like they come to college, especially when these efforts continue for a long time.
If you consider low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching for the system, then a single action will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gandara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children, from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College Tour funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Switch up a gang - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that begin when low income students are in the middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to lead larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry’s 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies suggest China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry that has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to account shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that made an order has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multiples at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq long.
Safety concerns, still underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military probably stopped American oil societies from engaging more in Iraq, analysts said, possessing the world’s third-largest raw oil reserves.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and take more risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, maintaining close relationships with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and assisting with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, spokesman of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the bid fee, pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil that the ministry was ready to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al-Qaeda’s top planners apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al-Qaeda planner is supposed to have been killed this week, U.S. terrorism fighters reported Friday.
This would, if confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a senior responsible for the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities representatives, who met their vehicle near Miran Shah in the province of Northern Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s unlawful tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official representative of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents who were suspected to belong to the militants ran to the place and quickly took everything left of the "fully destroyed bodies".
Local authorities failed to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. combat of terrorism indicated undetermined evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate character of U.S. air attacks on Pakistan’s ground.
Assuming its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. authority representative said that Somali had rapidly risen in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained the best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not at all reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribe area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a non-profit website undertaken by an organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability, while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul will withdraw
The leading UN messenger in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would withdraw from his office in March, which would end a stormful term that was triggered by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN messenger said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. military retreat schedule, which will begin in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We must accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in Afghanistan’s political shift.
The military side force increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not denounce his office, but only fulfilled an agreement reached to his family in March 2008 to stay only two years in Kabul.
He said he wants the notification to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now transmitting so he can have time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, Eid said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s leave and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban began searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say he considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and led the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eid position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy Peter W. Galbraith accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections in Afghanistan and to bear evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - which was fired - "the mission have undoubtedly harmed because there was already a large degree of sceptics regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the confusing UN settings have undermined his possibilities of bringing people capable in.
The UN rules have been designed so that since May, he said, only one person could hire.
This is catastrophic and it is not possible to go on this way.
U.S. Defence Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 U.S. soldiers in North Iraq and decreased the prospects of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said in answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such development.
“One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that our own unpredictableness to war.”
The Obama government draws a package of sanctions considering that is aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required to "convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer hugely" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European politicians in warning that Iran has to expect "credible" consequences if it doesn't have its nuclear program the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would re-establish the talks on the restriction of his nuclear program and renounce a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear tree materials for his medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has urged this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left negotiations on the preliminary agreements since that time -- partly, experts say because the Iranian leadership is divergent about whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community in terms of some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October, openly said that the international community, including Russians and Chinese, gathered together in a way they never were in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to track other options, including those which Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “expressive sanctions”.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned that on Thursday, some members of the Security Council called “basic and unfounded claims” on Iranian nuclear activities and said they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve a suitable long-term solution.”
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurdish and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the division of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to lower the US force by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to scatter the Kurdish concern about the upcoming troops deportation. U.S. representatives quoted Gates to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: “We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a single Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change of course in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda lectures, leading to them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a tomb more."
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course due to the low birth rate and the older population this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
Nothing left for a second child, Wang, 31, said, a staff manager with an eight months old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child Policy in China, which has generated two generations of notoriously thick, excited single children, lovingly called "small emperors", draws up a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time that this policy came into force.
Department of Population Issues is determined, while the number of populations from 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively by 2050, which is far above the global average of approximately 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people have scored almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported inhabitants, while the birth rate has been under one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples in the generative age need to get babies to "help the relationship of older population shares and to reduce the lack of workforce in the future."
"Shanghai will soon be as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Anchored in the country’s Constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial arrangement introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples that violate this policy have to expect enormous fines — up to their threefold annual salary in some regions — and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy that critical use of natural national resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuse in enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some pregnant women who had already a child have forced to remove.
Many couples had also performed gender-selective abortions, resulting in an unnatural high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one child’s policy.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions from the rule—including city inhabitants, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children—and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Institute of Population Research, said government representatives have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to allow two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters teaching families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that detailedly describe who is in question for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign was launched is to be detected, the urban districts report no change.
In the Huinan municipality with an inhabitants of 115,000, only four to five applications remain as an example per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be about 165,000 despite the campaign — slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai Caolu municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have anymore children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a small sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly assess one-child policy as a question of human rights, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we are robbed the opportunity to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff leader, said she wants only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone cared about us.
We are not used to taking care of others and don’t really want to do this either.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblooded.
For parents from the middle level with double career through which the birth rate drops, he said, it is about to be successful and you must be selfish for that.
The age group of 20-39-year-olds today grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want a life for themselves at all, he said.
A single child, he said, also poses huge demands for the time of parents.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild his apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is nine months old, you have already to have a CV for the best pre-schools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to bring too many victims.
UN Group designs plan for reducing emissions
The UN-backed climate conference – which has so far been distinguished by wild possessions and mutual accusations – has again focused on Friday with a document published, which will have an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, with industrial nations in the near future to share the biggest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that goes on, as next week more than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that the rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, head representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-sided document, has summed up a 180-page long negotiating text to focus on what the leading UN climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the whole.”
It shows the foundation of a possible agreement, in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95% by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to the talks on Friday through its assurance to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poor countries adapt to the impact of climate change – from the master of floods and droughts to the avoidance of deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The U.S. Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is driving a harder line with China, as representative of the Bush administration not only two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreement without the rise of larger emerging countries and taking action, so star, which also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders as well.
Stern announced his opinion an hour after the statement by Chinese Vice Minister He Yafei, which stated that it was either "reasonable" to the leading American climate dealer or "very unresponsible" from him that he said that the United States would not financially help China to master global warming.
As the future economic marching direction of the great world powers stands at stake, both within industrial nations and between industrial nations and emerging countries have opened off lines.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, while China and the United States command themselves for their corresponding commitments, while poor countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more daring measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are struggling for who should bear the cost of breaking the greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have made it more aggressive to account for countries with very high greenhouse gas taxation for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who also operates as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-side draft contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "exert political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks were a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions have to be addressed before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, have escaped their planes and raced through the Bella Center’s runways to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to set down claims negotiated over the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the congress center daily, guitar players host night shows in which they are funny about the countries that sell themselves in their opinion, and contract drafts are broadcast hand-to-hand rather than e-mail -- is already a challenge.
Intensity just builds up: almost all major ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 will be government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
UK's first 225 km/h faster train redefines the feeling of Monday
Monday morning at 5 o'clock 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in the traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed dealer train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent to London St. Pancras and 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin pending service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually couple faster to an international rail network, reliable trains and connect the largest settlement areas of Midlands, Northern and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant pendler cities, working times would be radically reduced, and the shift from aircraft and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and the storage on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage could still lead to the brakes in the British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will send Lord Adonis the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass a space of five meters across urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the outdoor terrain, the plan will display the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 is also designed to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route guide where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham, and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," a railway insider said.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first part route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to drop the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The designs injured the trains to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned to drive 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operating on the London-Birmingham route.
This would, in turn, mean that a terminal station in London would be needed, on which 20,000 travelers could be deployed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing train station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his view or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made until after parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains should first switch from high-speed trails to existing rail trails in the north of Birmingham, so the travel time between London and Scotland would remain over three hours.
This is considered as a crucial snack point to ensure a shift from aircraft to railway, a directional measure for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative's orange
Alan Duncan, the leader of the Conservatives’ underground member, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery, which he is planning to build in his residence in his electoral circle.
The prison spokesman of the party, degraded by David Cameron for complaining that underground members have to live "from lean rations," has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to allow himself to build an oak wood plant cultivation at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to invoice the taxpayer the additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The heads of the Under-House approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditures of the Under-House members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been yet cleaner or understandable.
Duncan, one of the richest underground members, has a two-storey house in a village in its electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure inspection point of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a winter garden, which is referred to in the plans as ‘orangery’.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to make a comment on the increased money intake.
Last month after an examination of his expenditure, the Committee released him from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his electoral house, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election to be a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage rate until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) a month.
Duncan’s RBS-Hypotheca’s interest rate has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the intake of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
Normal stepless RBS hypothecal rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Underhaus show that Duncan continued to apply his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) a month in May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the underhouse in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him in the event when he said after the exhibition scandal that parliament members would live "of lean rations".
“In essence, it means when you work for the state that you have to live by lean rations and how you are treated by S******e.”
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and raises the right to a disappearing little part, measured by what is belonging to.
And I could have requested the whole damn sum, but I don’t do it.”
The Parliament member, a millionaire from his previous career as a oil wholesale, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the Fees Office that this could be seen "as excessive demand."
An activist, as a protest in Duncan’s grass, digged a hole in the form of a pound sign after becoming known to have claimed for 4,000 pounds over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by the Fees Office, and following it by Legg to increase value."
He added: “There is no debate on evasion and permeation or bending of rules or similar.
Everything is completely visible and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's Beach Cottages Advents Calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new living content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every December day with Christmas songs as theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 a.m. to 18:30 a.m. at free lightning wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Christmas", wherein the decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old television marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergy of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect as a church from people to enter a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and host enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach cottages advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday worldwide and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a degree until Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, a Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilization in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, wholly dressed in black, had cracked out shoes with plasterstones and hams, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance police intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimates primarily members of "the Blacks Blocs", this extremely violent splitter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and stressed that some hundred of them were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with handhelds and position in sit.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters away from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to be able to welcome the intended speakers, for a night with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators are travelling with bushes and trains from the big European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with blue rain jackets, have made a first rise in Copenhagen in the morning as you have followed the call of friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a repair of the ecological fault to the south,” said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue and tell ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that can be dried out, water running where you can walk, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached the environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a form of globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate rights and social rights": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where there are many islands that are particularly threatened as a result of warming, has given the starting committee for demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have gone on the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
There were a few hundred people in Manila, mostly students who have marched in red and hated Bandanas where you have famous the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (West).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatism Abchazian has elected its president, Georgia denounced that it is a "strike" here.
Abchasia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independently, Tbilisi denounced the "street".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the South-Ocean territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The voting sites closed at 17:00 GMT.
The election participation was approximately 58% a few hours prior to the closure, according to the Abchasian electoral commission.
The first premature results should be announced in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President Serguei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
His part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abchazija is now under total rush-reliable occupation, said his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the autonomy of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After having separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousands of people died, Abchazia wants to prove, through this election, that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the choosing, who went to choose to an election site, located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, to choose a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of these presidential elections, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the District Head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election implementation.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an appreciation to Moscow’s support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abchasian autonomy.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated everywhere in the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for employment, arrested about 700 people at the edge of a major demonstration.
Thirty-thirty thousand people, according to police, hundred thousand have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries in search of an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013 until 18 December.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters away from the center and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was built to be able to welcome the planned speakers for a evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters who were fully dressed in black and armed with baking stones and hammers began hitting dishes, an AFP journalist declared.
Anti-disturbance police officers have immediately circulated you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg in eastern France in April.
At night, a police officer suffered an injury by a plasterstone on the chin during the incidents where twenty people were provisionally arrested, according to police, and four vehicles burned near a house.
"We have the extreme groups controlled," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the officers circulated in the air.
Most demonstrators travelling by train or by their own vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rain jacket, were formed in Copenhagen in the morning after calling the Friends of the Earth to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "climbing righteousness".
“Today we are going to the street to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the south,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition from the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves anymore: we still have time," says Benin's singer Angélique Kidjo.
“In Africa, there are rivers that drows, there are water flows through which you can run, which was never the case before.”
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalization opponents approached the environmental protection organizations.
The French deputy of the European Parliament and globalization critic José Bové told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the boost to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, around 50,000 people went on the streets in Australia.
Some hundred people in Manila, in most students, dressed red with Bandanas, have made claims for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also met in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the “Net of the 350” several hundred people joined together, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the "Journal du Domingo" that the subjects geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the high schools, even if they are not compulsoryly taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four week hours and the same program," Chatel said.
For the Minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but generally a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of scientific, and he continued, "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who had been angry about the lack of historic-geographic education in the terminal on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticised the state project of the erasure of mandatory teaching in history and geography in Terminals S (12th school year with scientific profile).
The Minister replied that there was no question about restricting the philosophy of the Terminals S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is victimized by the educational education of future teachers.
The Minister expressed that at the beginning of the year, they were subjected to an aptitude-related examination in Master 2 (M2) and that at the end of the year they were subjected to an approval examination in which their teaching skills are examined.
Furthermore, they conduct internships during the year in M2 and then teach students as a teacher in the internship a year before.
He continued to say, "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally explained that he wants to "offer individual rights to education" - a "matter that does not exist in folk education."
He once again confirmed that he wants to remove the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the operation at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced on Saturday morning at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each contact the audience with fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to achieve people and make them feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event returns to the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts were selected around the twenty discussion participants, even according to their charisma," he explains.
"One can speak for hours for climate heating, but the core goals can also be depicted in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that listeners may see that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos drawn by these conferences will be found online on the school page from December 15th.
The next Ernest Day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Payment delay: angry prison guardians, planned actions
The trade unions of the criminal execution officials called on Friday for a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overhours whose payments were discharged for budget reasons by January will be transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second union of the criminal executive officers (FO Penitentiary) urged employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday tomorrow before the criminal executive officer in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they do."
The 3rd union of the Criminal Executive Officers ("CGT Penitentiary") called on "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overhours, night supplements, and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December are considered to be "hazardous and unacceptable" market.
The first trade union of criminal executives, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on “common mobilizations (...) to demonstrate dissatisfaction and anger.”
The Executive Office and the Ministry of Justice declared that overhours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Department of Justice said in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal enforcement officials, guaranteed that the payment will take place next month.
“I know very well about the staff’s efforts to keep and modernize our penalty enforcement system functional,” the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the executive office to take immediate action so that such a situation that was caused by the lack of assessment of the overhours occurring does not repeat in the future," Alliot-Marie added.
Therefore, the December wage is lean, except for the leadership personnel who enjoy high service and target premiums, UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "budget requirements" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional union FO in Marseille announced to boycott "all meetings and calls" up to new instructions.
“The staff will not go on work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid; that also applies to their overhours,” the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“In a time when more and more tasks are taken up without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” Bordeaux’s CGT union said.
According to trade unions, the situation is not equal in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, UFAP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget, said.
Obama believes he is giving Christmas better than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has explained at the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is giving better and better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special show broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC Channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the game.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” reaffirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog, of course, also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama decisively rejected her husband’s claims to the quality of the gifts. “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she said.
"So please," he advised her skelmingly and indicated on the First Lady's pearl chain, "and who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known television moderator, who had so strongly supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten runs and also a basketball that his father had seen very rarely brought to him for Christmas from Kenya.
“I remember when my father visited us once Christmas and brought a basketball with me,” the president said.
“Only a lot later in my life I understood that I had that ball from him.”
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house,” Obama told Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was moved into artificial koma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "harm" after a surgery in France. According to the surrounding persons, the situation was "controlled", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial koma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated on Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had noted that he had suffered a band disk incident in Paris on November 26, his production company in Paris needed a re-surgery.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications”.
Only after 48 hours, however, we had a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
There was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company on the demand of the AFP.
RTL also confirms that "it shows from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a band disk incident.
The operation planned for several days was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was introduced to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a successive infection after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, on Thursday was RTL’s view that his friend just goes through a “deep valley,” but he assured that “no worry” is needed for the rock musician as this “a good fighter” is.
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles, and I told him it was fool to get on a plane after such a surgery twelve hours, that's not going so," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer’s producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacts good to antibiotics” and that “infection was prevented.”
Mr. Camus also explained that he spoke with Laetitia, the wife of the singer, and he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern about the singer’s health has grown increasingly since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was told that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer OP", which came to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been broadly commented, and fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer has been struggling to move on stage.
Only in mid-November, the surrounding persons had to deny a re-insertion to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Coursebahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, took an international title on his favorite distance, 50m free style, on the Euro 2009 shortline in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition when the last time the polyurethane costumes were allowed, there were only three world records, while one had expected a true record flood.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 meters and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 meters.
Shame for bousquet who wanted to catch the world record at the 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - an international premiere.
Bousquet conquered the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can always believe in greater and in the present case I have said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try it.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began for the first time in the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time has not been paid out for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m of leisure style (3:32.77), yet he has performed himself with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I cannot earn a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
US: Zola’s grave plate estimated to be $1.5 million
A Roman grave plate, which appeared except at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday over its value, the art dealer Sotheby's said.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm height. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been rated at $150 000 to $250,000.
The marble, on the "four scenes of Dionysos in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President of Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still going, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered most for so far,” said Dan Abernethy, spokesman of Sotheby’s, to the AFP.
The discovery of Emile Zola’s purchase of the marble part goes far away.
The record was nearly 300 years at home in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then she appeared piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used for it in her Paris hotel bathroom and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When he browsed the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "inheritance of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico has been denied
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the collapsed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to homeland as no longer compatible after the Putch Government rejected that this trip was unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya held at night, everything seems to suggest that one is dissociated with the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the immigration authority, the Mexican government’s plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, returned to its starting place.
The Putch Government wanted to require Mr. Zelaya to “acknowledge” and request political asylum for him abroad.
However, the bothered president rejected this because he wished to return to Mexico as a welcome, official head of state.
The coup regime "suffered a renewed failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...) they wanted me to give up," said Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often reported since the beginning of the political crisis, which remained in the Middle American country already five months.
I can stay well and like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the stubborn president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, beating some acords.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for a trip, which we unfortunately cannot accept, however, because it does not include asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, the Interior Minister of the Putch Government, explained to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I’m not asking for asylum in any country at all, answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur Channel, whose headquarters in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had emphasized, would only be the president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about an exit M. Zelayas had mobilised on Wednesday the followers of the collapsed president who rise to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around them, then the military there had strengthened its effort.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putch Government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, was crashed on 28 June, on the day of his organized folk survey to prepare his reelection, in contrast to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He was surprisingly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had escaped to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be imprisoned for high betrayment of which he is accused by the justice, the Putch Government says.
Putch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to revoke Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogres voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street Returns, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimization
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, U.S. trade balance figures testify to a recovery of the U.S. stocks and their partners: the Dow Jones increased 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq increased 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has increased from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was 0.58 percent (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market focuses merely on “half-glasses,” she said.
According to Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed to the numbers of the American trade balance sheet, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit dropped by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
In contrast, the analysts expected a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trade partners in the United States, Christopher Cornell commented from Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the status of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers has “fallen to the lowest point of the year over the last four weeks,” said Scott Marcouiller, Wells Fargo Advisor.
The obligation market has fallen.
The profitability of state bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from Tuesday night, and the profitability of bonds to 30 years has increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% from previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing at the power hold "Ladies in Weiss"
Some hundreds of partisans standing in Cuban power on Thursday have piped the wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day of political prisoners and also dismissed another rally due to which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
For the forty "ladies in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were pipped on open streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the foot march to the center of the town to demand the liberation of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Selders!", "the street belongs to the Revolutionaries!", "There are lives Fidel and Raul!", the empowered partisans scandaled against the dissidents with an elevated hand.
These latter were escorted by civilian agents who appeared to "secure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" took place in Havana last night, where there were neither injured nor arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took place at the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced dissidents in civilian vehicles, who were defeated by the government’s partisans, using violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As applicants for the Sakharov awards awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "Please to release all political prisoners" whose number has about 200 people, according to dissident list, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prisoner's at 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom until now sit behind grids.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime opponents as "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the stated Arch enemy, the United States.
A rare in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" fighters.
The Cuba ruled by a unit party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of dismissal of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Crazy kills eighty-year-old with the knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in Clichy-la-Garenne (Haut-de-Seine) city centre and injured five other people.
According to the first inquiry, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from unclear cause in or before a pharmacy at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, accordingly, police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a responsible for the police syndicate Alliance, is reporting the consequences of his injuries in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in the triennials, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were injured seriously to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured is at risk of life because, according to police sources, he apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in the "shock state".
The armed man, who, according to police, seemed to stand under alcohol or drug influence, was supposed to immediately escape the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently accidentally: one thirty-year-old and one forty-year-old, the latter heavy of both.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two flesh shears, which he was crossed behind his back, Arnaud Pressé, a responsible for the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine Area, said in the site.
Several passengers, including young people, are supposed to have attempted, according to the reports identified by the AFP, to crash the crazy.
I saw a guy in the three centuries with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn’t succeed because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a locker of an obvious bar.
A horde fell upon him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superintendent, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife labels, police reports.
This happened in one of Clichy-la-Garenne’s main struggles, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers came to me to tell me that there is a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them in first-aid stage and noticed a clawing wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came injured by cut wounds.
State police forces have finally arrested the man who did not carry any identification papers.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district reference of the criminal police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to inform the case.
The crazy was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn’t exclude that he’s being delivered into a nerve healing facility.
According to another source of police, six police officers had a dough to counter him at the police office in Clichy where he had been dropped.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" such as "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tather.
U.S.: Polanski’s Lawyer Calls on Return to Legal Prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called for law enforcement on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop his customer who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a conventional dismissal of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", has accused three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California in 1977.
I immediately call for penalty, Mr. Hummel said before he added that the behaviour of the judge Laurence Rittenband commissioned the case at the time of the trial "is leaving a cold down the back."
According to him, the meanwhile deceased judge Rittenband discussed with a prosecutor told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a serious proceedings mistake.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired) particularly by the disputed prosecutor David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally explained at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "began".
If the Court refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a proceedings that would enable him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The accusation has repeated the evidence already explained in First Instance, i.e., that a discussion on revocation of the accused stocks cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, still before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old.
Since that time, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
Phyllis Asayama, Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, said that Roman Polanski “must be there to join the trial.”
In this matter, you would like to spread the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused who is an escape possibility? asks Ms. Asayma.
The filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority.
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even stressed that “there would be other escape targets.”
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the arrest of law enforcement against Roman Polanski.
The victim’s attorney Samantha Geimer also once again requested the revocation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer be harassed by every resurvival of the affair Polanski and added: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland for the initiation of an American arrest order.
After he spent two months behind grids, he was then convicted in anticipation of a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is burned by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a rate in a market that was broken down between better indicators than planned in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 0.03 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Looking Silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains closely limited, the trade volume has become very low, and I think that it will remain so until the end of the year.”
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which “have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the economy recovery,” analytics summarised Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, therefore already two months in a row and much more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumers’ trust has significantly improved in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s index preview.
However, the indexes have been burned by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, thus pushing the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost somewhat in the ground.
The obligation market has declined.
The return of the treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3,540 percent on Wednesday night compared to 3,482 percent, and that of the bond over 30 years to 4,497 percent compared to 4,492 percent of the previous day.
Miss World re-election in South Africa
After a month’s round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the Miss World title on Saturday will cross the last obstacle to accomplish their dream: being elected to be the most beautiful woman in the world and watching this before a billion television.
During this great beauty trade fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the surrounding of Johannesburg, five of them have already earned their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were ranked to Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true struggle of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was just exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and made a lot of experience, Miss Sierra Leone said with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transmitted live on Saturday, from 17:00 a.m. (15:00 a.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine any more beautiful country to pass my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second residence in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "awesome landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, encounters with the press and safari, the miss now focus on competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to move into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and both were Bollywood stars.
It’s of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition with music and dance will be underlined.
The candidates defiled in traditional costumes and not to forget in swimsuit.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, Chinese Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a responsible Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows the world with a hardly overwhelming heart and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost by bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting was very exceptional with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the outlet in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people whom I probably could never approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised excitedly Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles airport where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, everything's going very well, said David Hallyday of the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 MEZ).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured he would "fastly" go to Cedars-Sinai hospital, to which Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial infection after a surgery in a band disk incident on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "moved into an artificial koma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his heavy pain and perform his treatment," the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial koma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, in which he was introduced to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial infection after a band disk operation on 26 November.
The singer had to again undergo operation in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the disease changes caused by the ultimate intervention.
His wife Laetitia attended a school event at the French gymnasium in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, an AFP photographer depicted.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They explained to us that he had done the newest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were totally angry, Camus said.
I have heard that you might start a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday “has been too fast and this has been traveling to Los Angeles with the Paris surgeon’s permission.”
I personally spoke to this doctor who assured me that he looks at this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me, as I had already two band disk operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer appeared to have left the hospital "without drainage, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artist milieu.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematome after brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has already been convicted several times because of missed surgery and not to forget about tax retreat and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the Chamber of Doctors, has referred to him as “a man without scrupe” who has to be “regular” before the Chamber Board and “all others are recommended.”
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have "perfectly gone" and post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "does not express bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been experiencing since a summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a little too short for the continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges Party Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The Party Alliance, which was monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, on Friday attempted to acquire the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, responded vigorously by the chairman of the Party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him to no longer use this seal on any more.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal because he believed that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
For his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claims the property of the UDF brand as he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propiedad industrial" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF-Friends of François Bayrous’s UDF-Friends oversaw the silence and clearly understood that they did not decline and set the Minister and the Deputy a deadline to no longer use this seal and transfer the property rights of the trademark to the Minister and the Deputy, threatened a court persecution.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF seal ++, the party’s alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau Centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, on its political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, UDF’s office explained and requested NC to “unexpectedly remove the name of UDF from all materials and (her) website.”
Hervé de Charette was also requested to transfer the trademark’s ownership rights to its legal rights of claim.
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to provide respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signature warned.
In their writing, they emphasize that UDF "since 1978 is a fully political movement and remind that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave these in 2007 to start a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The Party Nouveau Centre therefore, according to the signatories, has no rights to use the UDF Seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was at the time he requested the brand name for three years no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he benefits from the absence of depositing the UDF acronym to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, keep in mind that this inconsciousness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us more likely in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name instead of trying to come out of anonymity by adjusting oneself a name in a fraudulent way."
Affair Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Justice of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as Billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to slash some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be held in court on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime convicted with a maximum three-year freedom penalty and a €375,000 penalty.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this affair that is worthy of the saga one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fasten themselves and at the same time have the trains of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oréal in hand.
Likewise, the 15th Chamber of Criminal Crimes ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's legacy and principal shareholder has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted during the investigation by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre.
The physicians appointed on Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which they clearly announce whether and at which times Liliane Bettencourt may have been found in a condition of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) and the opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that must be protected, he reaffirmed.
For two years, Liliane’s only daughter Bettencourt has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years to give himself a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer whom she considered as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' appeal, the lawyer’s plaintiffs led to a large family deback on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer called himself to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please, you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once to twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since her marriage.”
The prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the view that the applicant had no right to respond so, especially because a guardian judge has rejected her application to initiate a court protection proceedings against her mother in the last few days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legitimate, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in her place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the trial took place on Mme Bettencourt-Meyers' accessibility.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Disclosure?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies has been our struggle for the development of economic intelligence for free ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies in relation to consumers before the marketing revolution: It is determined for the employees to join "values" the best as it was previously designed to impose on consumer products by technicians at the factory.
By giving the customer to the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customers' preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demobilization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much bigger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) calls "by all parties involved (...) for a proactive approach and a future-oriented perspective"; it demands from employees a commitment to which the instructions of authoritarian management entirely oppose.
Therefore, we ask for a business revolution that would consist of putting employees in the middle of the company’s concerns equally alongside the customer.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately, not.
- First of all, because I could find that the entire fitting in the face of a new situation after many ways is finally trying to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioral theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknownly spread widely by research institutions and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to actuate the “lift” (sic) for employees’ commitment, Ipsos’ Le Figaro.fr’s current survey encourages the leaders in a position towards a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a operational revolution required for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the acceptance of a final view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of control: for the wage recipients, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business based on a predetermined Doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and replace their human resource management right.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is advantageous for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: “Right war” brings Obama’s praise from the right
American rights greeted the speech held by Barack Obama last night in Oslo on Friday and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked Obama’s award assignment on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidential Candidatin in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the Right Wings of the Republican Party in the USA Today daily newspaper and added that she himself spoke the theme of a "sometimes necessary" war in its published memories.
War, of course, is the last thing that I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, endeavored to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the presidency did "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who recognized especially the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts, I felt this speech entirely historically, explained Ginrich, who was asked in the radio station "The Takeaway".
The previous deputy, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and could not give a prize for peace if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer by George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held “a very American speech.”
In addition to being “cosmopolitan” as “he always does it,” he has “spoken like an American president,” when he pointed out that the Europeans “live like in a safety bubble that they didn’t create themselves and do not do much for their protection,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a fake of the era Bush, spoke on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, high-race and inspirational."
To the left of the president, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the back-up to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praised on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was early awarded to Obama, called the speech for a speaker like him known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "provides a schedule to manage international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper excited.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and refers to his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Remote driver: Three Marathons for Agreement to Secure Christmas Supply
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday night that ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass for Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated themselves in the early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And that even though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "caused a lot of damage to companies" and "it was worried that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides an increase in salary by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transportation) and by 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transportation).
The hour rate for workers with the lowest wages is therefore rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not very much, but we’re starting small first,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to no longer block the supply centers.
“However, there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement,” he added.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on healthy understanding and respect for employees,” says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “a historical agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintainment of the total road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable to address the 13th monthly salary and the modernization of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the taxes for employers of 100 million euros" was the subject of a Government amendment to the 2009 Draft of Correct Finance, which was adopted at night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls for a "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the enterprises attached to that organization and to then apply to the entire occupation in the event of an expansion by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," insured Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR federation lamented a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "was already promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to dilute the Gans-Essers on the nearby Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "swape a large tomb to small and medium-sized companies in the industry in the coming 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions disagreed with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on the line RER A, the largest railway network in France for the largest area of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transportation administration), the strikers with their claims for wages can continue to wait.
On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route only one of four trains were ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to move.
The Galeries Lafayette store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP strives to engage the large businesses in a technical way.”
The line RER A passes through the Paris municipality from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the places of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one of two trains to the main traffic time was scheduled, and almost none during the poor traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human climb on the railway as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had addressed the situation.
So early in the morning, the railway station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overwhelmed than otherwise, especially due to the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he would have “staged up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, who had planned to assist the travellers by employees and officers, noted that there had been no crashes at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER line A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed through the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed which the associations had classified as “necessary” after the meeting with the top of the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER business manager proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER line A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional courses, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, however. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-paid wage supply.
The CGT was angry that the RATP itself puts its wage supply proposals in clamps and emphasized that the leadership point "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP stated that a re- meeting was intended for "comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company “ignores the weekend drivers.”
In the morning, approximately 150 drivers set up a committee in Paris.
It was once again the leadership point, which until now rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after calming the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a previous announcement of Unsa and Independents.
The associations call for a wage supply from 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, 30 of which are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and also complain about the worsening of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers are traveling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of €2,200 to €2,700 as well as a wage supplement of €600 to €650 for layer services as well as Sunday and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision that followed the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which strives to get the hands of the Kurdish community to end the conflicts that have been in the last 25 years.
The “Party for a Democratic Society” (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “place for activities that are harmful to the independence of the state and its indivisible unit,” says the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision towards the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision was made unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including President Ahmet Turk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political event for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the revocation of parliamentary immunity, enjoying Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders of the Party stated before the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament rather than as party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a prosecution initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "whiteness" of the Worker Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that “no connection” with the PKK, however, refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court works between the Government who seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurdish in order to leave the support of the PKK by the Kurdish and to end the conflicts.
The DTP leaders reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a re-eruption of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in the million town of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mostly populated by Kurdish.
The officers used tear gas granates and watersmiths when the demonstrators began throwing molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen despair even further”.
“Turkey cannot clarify this question (Kurdish editorial) on the basis of the prohibition of a party,” he said.
The government, consisting of a party that came from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are in principle opposing the closing of the parties.
This doesn’t solve the problems,” says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedation of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government,” said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"Obviously, you can get touched to a PKK reaction," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was acknowledged to be an attack in which three days earlier seven soldiers killed in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break can come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to scam the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
Instead, so that its employees can try and learn to master all the vehicle technology.
The weekend, according to meteorologists, could be so far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES takes place according to an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-streets with large-scattered vehicles are disappeared, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and crossroads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, public routes, pedestrian zones and trails with cracks, such as the Atzbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3 p.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would need to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
This is why the FES starts at 3 p.m. at night, "so that the routes are free until the traffic starts."
It will be difficult until it snows at 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, the winter service manager says, “because then no one is ready to make the spread vehicles space.”
Only afterwards, if it doesn’t snow further, there are carrying and expansion roads, including the Council-Bil-Road, on the row.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on the road, hazard points and transitions are prioritized.
All cycling paths cannot be worried about the FES.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly keeps the bridges in the eye from 22 to 4:30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is softness on this quickly, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the road.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Dinosaur's Weight
Tawa Hallae looked like many other flesh-eating dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long-scale skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle scrapes and a long tail.
Had the kind lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The animal lived approximately 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was at the time in a dry zone of the Pangea supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relationships, the spread and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began burying on the Ghost Ranch in the North of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on a day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new type.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about dino-free history
The name “Tawa” comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional foundation: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only individual fractures are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinos is usually controversial.
For example, experts debate when the axes split into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropodes, among which later the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which belong to those known as the "long-hauls" of the species, the four-legged sauropodes and their relatives, and the eating orthis.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
The researchers found, for example, indications of air bags, such as the descendants of the theropodes, the birds, on the skull of Tawa hallae.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropodes later also had air bags and lightweight construction bones, probably the joint predecessor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the axes appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three development lines were separated early and spread from South America over all land parts, which at the time formed a single land mass as the supercontinent of Pangea.
For this, the fact that the team, together with Tawa, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropodes.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions as well.
An even older kind, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion might result in a distorted picture, because in South America, many particularly primitive dino fossils have remained, while there is hardly anything to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian stam to the dominant farm animals of the earth’s middle-ages, it is still mysterious.
During the trias, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and fly saures and with numerous other axes.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread across the world and developed many new species, while the relatives at the border died from the Trias to the Jura.
History of success was not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that survived the dinosaurs randomly, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition from the field.
The story of success was not eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite intake helped to flourish a group of animals, which had also developed in the trias and since then frested a shadow-being: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto stand on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police house of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University hits waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarised with the protesting students at the campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "missbilled" the police operation led by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and faculty in educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been lubricated.
Five students were injured.
The subject damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The household represents a “non-acceptable intervention” in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimation and criminalization of the protest" and departs from the contents.
The Bureau has removed the necessary discussion.
The teachers call for immediate liability of criminal prosecution.
The majority of beseters have not supported the damage, it says.
Legitimate protests
The youth of the union Verdi and the German union association are also solidarised with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi’s Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s minister of science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), defended the action of the unipresident and police.
We are grateful to the Unipresident.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday at Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, said CDU landtag member Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw that SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, you have taken up.
The left has filed a request requesting the Minister of Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, she was considered a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow’s capital, was a strictly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives have linked to the Frankfurt Sciences Location of Riedberg – with the uniinstitutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow’s vice-master Juri Rosljak and Prefecture Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd deployed the Russian delegation, signed Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it’s also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ are allowed to catch foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want to earn orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large groups Sitronics and Rossyjskaya Electronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") received his name from the forested hilllands where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital for a decade in a helicious building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head train stations with railways ending in the middle of the city were then considered as traffic-technical fossils of the 19th century, which looked like brake clothes of a modern railway traffic, as it once took a lot of time to turn locomotives from the back to the front.
Enter, hold short, drive further - so let's go.
And this is why the railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a cross-train station, which lies about half the trans-European rail magic between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big town it is almost invaluable to implement the depths.
However, headbahnhofs no longer have problems with entry and exit since there are modern switching trains with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the ICE rebuilding route to Ulm are now being approached.
Country and municipal politicians have enforced it.
The train is also due to the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the State Group.
The project is still justified by urban construction.
There is a new city space, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the traffic system.
The tram station and the expansion of the trains are designed for travelling to which - typically in the 1980s - one has signed huge growth.
There was not the competition of the cheap flights at the time.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be about strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for goods trains because of heavy climbs.
Even more grave is that S21 indirectly tanges many other railway projects.
Almost six billion euros are expected to be curved in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion are realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other node points and narrow points on the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 kilometres long track through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the trail in timelupen time.
Urgently it would be necessary to correctly press on the tube here.
But S21 will work as a brake slot.
The Rheintal route is the bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment to airport
The state government has left open at Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go to revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally examine the over 400 pages comprehensive VGH judgment, Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had written that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest-Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country must re-regulate the night flight ban.
The authorization of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, should not be agreed with the legally required protection of the population against nightly flight noise.
The coalition must decide until January 4 whether it will go against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this downturn and urged government representatives to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election for a night flight ban.
It is damn tough to keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, in appeal to the FDP election slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the charge of Shepherd-Gumbel, the state government tries to come to their night flights with "right turning and tricking".
A precise legal examination needs your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a right-controlled dismissal, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken U.S. big banks decline their state chains.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp in a total of $45 billion (good $30 billion) on one blow.
The Citigroup also plans to repay the state aid according to a report from the US broadcast CNBC.
The institutions want to eliminate the limitations associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of manager bonuses and the charge of high fees.
The Bank of America had taken about $19 billion fresh money from investors about change bonds.
The rest of the sum she took out of her own cash, which was well filled, among other things, by splash sales.

In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned their help.
Fast choice
Everything went faster than thought.
About two weeks after the ZDF Board had pushed out the office of Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Yesterday night the Board wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadt studio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially in order to avoid the proceedings.
However, it is likely to have played a role not to further damage the ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter, even if this proposal should not be enforced by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed at the conclusion of the editorial issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, but Brender's defeat was a defeat for shepherds, however one expectable.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had signaled for weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
He organized the resistance to Chief Editor of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's news releases had lost at start rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly-supervised chief editor.
There were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was beaten shortly before the election.
Lastly, even 35 state lawmakers had been mixed into the debate, which considered the action of Kochs as unconstitutionally.
It's not enough.
To the person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked at the Südwest Funk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey switched to ZDF, first to "today's journal."
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 a personal referee of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgen Magazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional appeal after the Brenders election, which was still elected on Wednesday by the Medium Magazine of the Year's Journalist.
Koch’s counterpart in the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palsian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the staff proposals of the manager cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also concluded a removal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a smart chess train - criticizing the Board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalist independence, both shepherds could nominate him without a loss of face for the post of the chief editor as well as the Board of Directors, without suspicion of hiking a party member into office.
In the partial arithmetics, Frey is assigned to the left liberal.
Studies are discontinued
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Culture Ministers of the Countries finally led: At a meeting of Culture Ministers and Higher Education Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: Basically, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
It is also intended to review the workload of students and ensure a "realistic and representative degree".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audits between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making joint structural requirements for bachelor and master’s degrees more flexible.
In addition, there should be no country rules that are differing from that.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and University Rectors carry the poultry word from better studentability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: “Each module usually concludes with only one exam,” says a 30-page paper that is intended to partly re-regule the approval of degree programs.
With the "delicate reduction of the examination burden," declared Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm, "a stop of error development that significantly impaired studentability should be offered."
Furthermore, the "studiability" will be the "decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strength to check then", whether "unnecessary participation of students in choosing the
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "required to maintain playgrounds that enable and promote their own initiative."
The rules are intended to apply for the approval of new programs, but also for the review of existing programs.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, however, which means that it takes up to 2015 until all degree programs have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout the nation under the Accreditation Board established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called upon the countries to influence the agencies in such a way that the substance filling is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the departments of the country on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are mainly intended to set up tutor programs and to strengthen study advice, examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros for this.
In early 2010, the government wants to introduce a novel of the higher education law to Parliament.
After this, only one exam is needed for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to become more flexible, also to ensure the recognition of certificates of performance in other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the next year, all the country’s degree programs will be reviewed for their studentability.
Government and opposition on Thursday again discussed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso Highschool Groups called for the development of educational policy to be no longer held behind "closed doors" of ministers and higher educational directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now also be "talking about a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Higher Education Rector Conference (HRC), Margret Wintermantel: “We need the student experiences,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers with which the HRC discussed a joint reform paper.
The union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough as a whole of the Bonner decisions: it calls for a legal claim that allows each graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that today’s generation of bachelor students will be available enough master’s degrees with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, GEW Board member Andreas Keller said.
Countries need to hire significantly more faculty.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express a friendly access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany is almost no control..." is the initial line of a poem by the Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which it themes the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian Banat in 1951, had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a reader in a child book publishing before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian literature forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He made a significant extraliterary outlook last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where he was about "German literature in Romania in spiegel and scrappiegels of their security acts".
Visibly, Söllner uncertainly and dismissed an explanation in which he made his collaboration as a IM for the Romanian intelligence service towards German colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner said, "so someone who didn't reject enough against attempts to intimidate the securities."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time with the Nobel Prize Reward for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken by a case that makes it clear that a political system can be founded on monitoring and setting up.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrators but also the victims.
In his Securitate Act, Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession of the literature scientist Michael Markel and pointed out the positive influence of Walter for him.
He had him in all the difficult points for him at the time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, however, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not completely surprising.
Germany was a cozy reserve for Securitate Spice, Herta Müller had written in July in the time after reading her own record, 914 pages.
The affected persons, as suspected, are speculated and in some cases they probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the meantime very proceedings-safe viewing of the stasi acts in this country, the handling of the leaves of the Securitate Monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been disturbed and disrupted in recent years.
One of the relevant birth authorities of the National Council on the Elaboration of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded until in 1999, but the issue of the documents has been more slowly since.
Since 2005, there is only a law governing the administration of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate Chief of Temesvar declined to express the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only answered once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
The case of Söllner is certainly inevitable questions, as often in connection with hidden guilt.
Why only now? Who has been hurt? The sensitive response of the listeners to Söllner's confession hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by attention to knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
League Champions League
It appeared as if there just came a dressed foreign officer from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports product manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment climbed one quarter of hours after midnight into a triggered C-class.
The man with the remarkable flatness could heat himself because of the foreign city.
Otherwise he could also drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the 55-year-old wasn't so drunk before luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just go right.
In the words of the only three days earlier committed to the Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final," namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot leave ourselves blind of success: there will be a brutal hard struggle against the decline."
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the daily liga in Mainz.
And discontinue the weaknesses re-revealed after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Category: Outlook
The eighth finale of the Champions League (games 16./17. + 23./24. February/returns 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be enrolled in Nyon on December 18.
The joy of Babbel’s fulminating stand remained behaved.
Not only was the alleged healing provider, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professional self-confidence, engagement and game joy in the short period of time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them to be more bold, explained Soul Clipper Gross the so simple sound of success recipe, which had no longer given effect under the therapist Babbel.
He depleted a certain magic, Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, “If a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things that one would not have thought to be possible happen.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a week-long injury break, thanks to his dynamics equally to the best player on the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbally "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor worked: "He is a man who demands through and discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Babbel obviously lacked it.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs mainly Constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also kept themselves from overvaluing the victory against a replacement weak and completely overwhelmed defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before the evil awakening came in Leverkusen at 0:4 later, Khedira gave it to bear in mind.
And the Sports Board Horst Heldt warned that although one seasonal goal has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We are not above the mountain yet.
That heroes on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months had not been celebrated, were the events of the weekend, which broadcast in the form of a television interview directly before the beginning of the game by doorguard Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, hero contested the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the Board of Directors of Weakness and decided to change coaching on pressure puberty fans.
Also that his free day after games had been removed, Lehmann valued Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and misunderstanding.
Lehmann’s statements are “shaped by pure egoism,” heroed back and announced consequences for the final man.
You might not be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all others that without the preparing work by the replaced coach team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants have "a large share of success," said Herot and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Cup fighting in heavy weight
Hitching duel in Bern: Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko is always provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainians defended their heavyweight title according to WBC version.
The judgment of the pointer judges fell unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the WBC association defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points on Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC Associations.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to beat himself due to injuries.
Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th struggle.
About 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena wanted Klitschko to dictate the fight above all with its left-hand leadership.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly removed the beatings of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive target.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to come over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats hit the world champion rarely.
After all, he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
Before the fight in the Swiss capital, the challenger had provided a few vertebrae.
He insulted Klitschko as "hate zombie", which "nothing can correctly."
When weighing, the champion then provoked himself on Friday to pull Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth struggle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of break, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned to his WBC belt, which he had to beat without fighting before.
This year he then conquered Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one struggle in this struggle and I am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four major title in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the WBO and IBF Associations.
The WBA’s belt, however, was carried by the British David Haye after he was able to throne Nikolai Waluwev, 2.13 meters in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September-planned fight against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
Its promotional society is now planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left are calling for the Chancellor’s disclosure.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent findings of Kunduz's airstrike, the Opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone a conscious deception.
The minister said on the September deadly bombardment on two tank load trains "knownly the falsehood," Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin said Saturday in the ARD news release "Tagesschau".
It is called landly: he lied.
The command to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about destruction of the kidnapped lasters, but also about targeted killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air attack requested by German Cunduz Commander Counter Klein, according to NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and Left called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government - and whether Chancellor, Bundeswehr and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Collegin Renate Künast called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor has not influenced concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also a loud doubt about the presentation of the Ministry on the backgrounds of the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the backgrounds of the tank laster attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and dismissed the minister’s sensitive details.
However, the environment of the two senior officials stated that they had even pointed out the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including a two-sided document of the commander Court Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert was supposed to have asked in a letter to clarify the fact, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports.
He has not received an answer yet, he says.
On Saturday, the ministry did not comment on the charges and pointed out that this will be cleared in the Bundestag's investigation committee, which will constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mentally ill and in drug rush, the boundaries between imagination and reality flood.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is okay.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can unhinderedly dedicate ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
But whoever experiences traumatic conditions in growing, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special living.
However, such pictures and voices arise not only in mentally ill or in drug drowsiness.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels, sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality swim.
Such a dream changed waking consciousness states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystician Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanic removal states, psychosis and hallucinations can still be led to similar processes.
Hallucinations or madness occur when the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and mad thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore.
The association of madness and dream has been employing philosophers and doctors since the ancient times.
Aristotle meant hallucinations as a form of dream in a wake-up state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 a "large similarity of irreliance with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was equally "a psychosis, with all unreliances, wageness of such senses".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the room cover.
He feels a trick.
Behind him, devil-shaped wings with blood red, distorted fractures, teeth-fleating.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain on the whole body.
Sounds, evil voices thrown from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that slander and offense him.
Henning T. removes two cables from the stereo system, knot it to a blade and attach it to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays the slot around the neck.
Springt.
The slot is resolving.
This is going to be a teaching to you, shouting the voices in a choir, "Go to the clinic and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, plus he is mania-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The pictures are cruel reality
About one percent of the population has schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics, it is treated as a second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between internal and external worlds, they fall into an excited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is listening to voices - voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate important things from an unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the sludges for a flood of ideas and imaginations that emerge from deeper layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Superior Physician for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrene is located at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, he gets in a passive role, he becomes overwhelmed, similar to in dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality although they are usually not possible, the deceitful images are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Having once experienced a hallucination in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but remains in principle maintaining the sense and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis."
The mad thoughts and hallucinations focus in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain blows capriols, researchers still present mysteries.
Fuchs says that emergency states can lead to anyone to lose the reference to reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic prediction for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the alone-determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in affected persons.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a mystery about how the disturbance of the neural system occurs, which does not manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get one, Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten says.
Whether fake images are considered as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a matter of view.
Box has collected reports on hallucinations and deceitful signs for ten years, and last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Heads".
Although hallucinations belong to the typical accompanimental symptoms of psychoses, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline or depression, they often also include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease, and scalp stroke.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain even of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to the box, are composed of memory content that are usually retained.
They arise when cerebral reactions in which sense perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain runs hot, or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition just as brain damage or psychosis.
But just likewise, reluctance, stress, love suffering or other mental emergency states.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents said they had experienced a hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnastics.
A very normal girl, actually.
If not the pictures and votes were there.
During the break, it may occur that a stupid boy with long, dark hair responds to it.
If he answers, the students look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shameful girl is a spooned dream girl, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she's listening and seeing this boy, just as she's listening and seeing the girl in the bank next to herself.
She can even feel her presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
“Are I crazy?” she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other deceitful images are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often, the footprints are also a load.
When sitting in the classroom, she cannot sometimes follow the teaching material because the teacher just presents a new student in her eyes and ears while explaining mathematical equations for all others hearing and visible on the board.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening.
When in her dark room she waits for sleep that comes too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on arms and legs emerge in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be quiet, she screamed on the shapes.
Parents and friends tell them nothing about that they would feel crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the abitur last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist on the Internet, she knows that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from incitement, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, box says.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and ensures itself for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, she heard that the man she calls father since she can think is not her physical father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish those affected like Sarah K. to mistaken images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "is in the brain, the reality forms out there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they are so real.
Even night dream images consider boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not essentially different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their fraud as irreal.
Therefore, box advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our too consciously focused world, unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor at the Florence Nightingale Hospital’s psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, sad illness, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of traumaticly altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake-up state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations related to trauma or disease, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience motoric paralysis in full consciousness.
“When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete movement incapacity, he replaces the life-threatening reality with a very own, imaginary world decoupled by reality,” says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A type of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is presented in imagination.
An intense form of sentifying and sentifying in a self-indulgent situation that allows people to not undergo their own design ability in nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness is traveling after a heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation for days, while his body is convicted of motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen dips into a self-built world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bed prosecutor, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make noise from blood.
When a Greek is carried out on the motorcycle in his homeland, his hospital bed surfing in the Alps’ snow and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He goes completely on in the imaginated happenings, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels differ essentially from every dream for Clausses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys are obvious to me after years and in side details.
More clear and even more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other livelihood experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug smoking show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children should take the publisher at the age of 27
The new publisher chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company to his two children, he told Spiegel.
The holding is expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherited at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told Spiegel.
The details of this have been regulated by precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company will only arise afterwards.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You cannot apply 7,500 employees to your children if they are not sufficiently empowered.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he retired from the Board of Directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen to be his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for corporate assets came to it and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure was also responsible for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "overbridge 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
In view of the cases of Schickdanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies aren’t sure before the death: “This was always concerned with families who were infected by capital addiction who have fully speculated and thought they could so rise to the entirely great player.
My strategy was never.
He had “never had world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Complete Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1,000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao, Madrid, where everything is just about physical care.
In the wellness area on the eighth floor, among other respected firms such as Hedonai, which provide a laser hair removal; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatment; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that highlights its teahouse with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours, to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne.
The total area is 250 m2, divided to 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual coaches who take care of customers’ training units and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit with entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts properly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching exercises) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if after you have trained your body, you still want to go through the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments to regain hair splendour, gloss and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 in the morning to 22.00 in the evening 365 days a year.
The Most Various Decolletés
Christmas is ever closer and therefore it’s a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their clothes into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an overwhelmed and very complicated decolleté, which can only be abrated.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
Together with the city of Barcelona, the electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make mobility agreements by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is designed to summarize the electrocars and opinions and measures in the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the project MOVELE to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
It is however not the only initiative to participate in the endsa in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country’s largest exporter, “a horizon of peace.”
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures that the Government launched to support the automotive sector over the course of the government year.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would have a panorama of the neglect and closing of some of our main production plants today,” said the president.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automobile manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the part of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall automotive industry plan (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to stimulate demand, in accordance with Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with autonomous communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government, this plan allowed the exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to reduce an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong growth" in approvals that increased "by 40%" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally compatible sports
Mazda wants to prove that sport is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine’s automatic stop and drive system, based on the name i-stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out by its good ratings on the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strap behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good standing.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is awarded.
In further view of the unit consisting of the instrument board and the frameboard, you can find that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are derived from the nudity of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive easily by car.
All of this comes a large and clearly shaped suitcase.
The stop and drive system is so far available only for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a true pleasure. It emerges by its fineness, quiet noise, performance and low consumption.
And all those who do not drive a lot of kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the switching and low consumption, even though the diesel models are especially the best selling at Mazda.
In terms of the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test ride is a particular feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
In the series, the driving track changing assistant (RVM) stands out above all, as well as the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirrors, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, and Bluetooth.
Furthermore, this version also includes, as if it wasn’t enough of equipment, the premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, the learnable Bixenon windows and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behavior and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not take a lot of kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine at 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the model Sportive.
In return, however, at this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tepppich of sensuality for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shine more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is first limited to read a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to view certain attachments or surfing through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five-minute fame when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of interest especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example just half of the flat rate price of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has launched two new devices on the market: one intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise parade.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to refrain from all the data to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you desperately search for a café with WIFI (or a connection possibility with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It’s true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for abroad stays, but I’ve been in my experience, you already need a doctoral degree in physics and a good glasses to read all the small printed glasses.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission regarding affordable roaming fares across Europe almost always remained unaware.
Beyond your own country you are always afraid of reading your emails and rightly.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this type of rates, means that the phone providers need to rethink slowly but safely and start to consider various ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices includes downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vegans and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, when buying, and not monthly.
And that’s what I’m expecting one day from FonPeek to purchase with lifelong internet access as the peek already offers in the US.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at Barack Obama’s office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this colour and has re-elected the same colour to accompany him, without doubt, at his second most important moment in his lifetime: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama weared very similar models during both occasions: that it was almost the same colour - a shiny green yellow - consisted of the clothes of three parts - dress, jacket and jacket of the same fabric, and therefore she weared somewhat large-shaped stitched or a necklace.
It even goes to the extent that at the first sight it appeared that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
During the official launch, she weared a dress made of tip and a patterned sample in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high sets and for the second time an anxious model, but golden.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was stitched up as a hair crown during this occasion, while the hair was open at the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want to have children.
This results the study "Fruitability and Women's Career in Spain" conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of women working see their career opportunities on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract will be more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a firm employment, especially in the public field, move the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after joining together, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment that have taken longer to achieve this and that have accomplished their joining together and the first child only much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on maternity, although less than the calendar in terms of preparedness for conceiving," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they only have primary degree or higher education, were mother in average each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a primary degree marry before their first conclusion and getting their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree make it exactly different and only seek a conclusion and then marry afterwards and then getting their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his all-envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also tell the generally known advertising phrase "Because you are worth it."
The main actress of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actress at international level, will thus become another famous sketch like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actors Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (college of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today – met at the annual awards held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For that occasion they all appeared.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen to be the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Ass" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) to the three-way X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an eagerness to the glowing piece of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save any terror or lighting.
Because this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: “When I read his sides, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt without having found words: the joy contrary to the unhealthy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god.”
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegoric Christian, he wrote about what he had in blood, not in his mind, between the impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drawn by this woman with a passion, which was launched for thirteen years, derma in her ban, in whose flesh emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance due to adultery, a spiritual privilege consisting of coming into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, which is one of the 8,000 summits in the world’s literature, you have to climb up on the northern wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbers are trying again and again.
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange cause.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the inheritance of a county property owner and other times he said that he would be the son of a black and crocodile.
Both dreams have proven of a certain thing.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy scream that was shouted out of a bridge from that personality from Munich so that he could find his echo in his literary way to the night of the 20th century.
On Dorothy Parker, “One day she kneeled and lay down: ‘My worthy God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: “These verses of Spencer are engraved in his grave: ‘Sleep after effort, after the storm of the port, after the rest after war, after a rich life is pleased to death.’”
Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spy her between the Azaleans or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man raised so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was even much greater than her madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than trying to infiltrate Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet intended if he did not take Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did it do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he can stand himself upon this podest?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district last week in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer we brought out of the animal home and weighs just six pounds, and then from the heavy sky they missed him two foots and woundering him heafter.
Our indignation cannot be perceived in words, because it is incomprehensible for us, where the joy should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the line.
Furthermore, the crackdown attack a woman who was walking comfortably got when she wanted to resolve these people due to the incident, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a crazy man attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has spent the whole day.
Of course, we have returned advertisement at a close police office, but we have great doubts whether this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the fierce criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in the minds that they find a cheap attack on an helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially for younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “includes more than just designing and manufacturing products that become increasingly safer with each day” and continued to reaffirm that it also helps with other educational and informative actions to come closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, running under the slogan ‘To be or not to be’, will be distributed posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that road safety is a "constant concern" of the company, and especially because it is always committed to developing ever-secure products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles.
Sales of small cars increases again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be cautious, as the reference data used for comparison of November 2008, which was a particularly bad cause year with a decrease by 60% in relation to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, apart from the rise last month, the total approvals of the 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles consisting of the small carrier market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small cars, small cars and lighter small cars/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same clouds in the sky that affect the most demand, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the large part of the sales goes to small and medium-sized enterprises who in almost 100% of all cases make purchase with a third-party funding.
These restrictions, which are the consequence of credit institutions' accelerating money, must include other factors, such as increasing the unemployment rate or the perseverance of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial assistance in the purchase of a vehicle of the 2000E plan has helped little.
However, this plan is not only for individuals, but self-employed and small businesses have the right to purchase a small carrier of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 exhaust that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had recalled that it is absolutely necessary by the state to focus on these small-lasters as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealers association prophesies for 2010 a year similar to the last year, for which it expects a 19% failure of sales (for passenger cars and ground cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now obligatory
As with the anti-blocking brake system ABS and now with stability control ESP, the braking aid systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars in emergencies.
In fact, they are already duty for all newly authorized passenger cars and lightweight cars, for the remaining vehicles a carence period has been fixed by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's adoption aims to improve the protection of the pedestrians, however, these brake systems can also help prevent many accidents due to their functioning.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manufacturer that the system detects on the brake pedal using the brake strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision didn’t get to the brake pedal and half of them didn’t have completely braked.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid enters the brake system with maximum force, reducing the brake time and thus also the brake distance a car removed during the brake operation.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 deadly accidents in which fugitors are damaged could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with person damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems becomes popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (over radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while it already exercises a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the crash is already inevitable, the brake assistant will exercise the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves plan for Opel to January
While the staff of the Opel factory in Figueruela (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab will be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. car manufacturer so that it makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in touch with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer’s option of Skyper sports cars, who has back cover from the Russian Converg group, gains increasing advice.
If none of these buyers agree, GM could sell some assets to Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold until then will continue to be maintained.
On the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as a foundation and really managed to make it easier for 80 pounds, with which he now only brings 1,275 pounds on the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they first abandoned the automatic folding roof replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, so that alone you saved 21 kilos; thanks to the easily used aluminum doors such as the GT3's engineered, the additional 54 "disappeared" and the additional 15, by the exit of the air-conditioning, 13 times.
Then, by refraining from the audio system CDR-30, it had once again reached six kilos less and by replacing the door handles by fabric handles the missing kilos.
Although it is also available with the double coupling gearbox PDK, the trial drive was carried out with a 6-popular manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller landscapes of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note without blame.
However, the reduction of his weight has nonetheless led to that that he would no longer be so safely on the street.
It is rather the opposite case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and lightweight model, but at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a low running time, until we give him the commands to shave, brake, recover, and then remove everything out of his engine...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as well as accurate.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and it is still possible to increase with the 'sport' option as well as using a system that can change the engine noise already used for the first time in Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unthinkably brutal, whether it stands out or re-accelerated.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landstraßes we driven on with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track at all; and that, although we found ice in the morning and roll split in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, you can say that it’s an ultra lightweight car, a car with which you have an unexpected driving pass, as otherwise it’s rare and there’s much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl
The singer, a breast girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional star in the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her bad face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bad Girl".
Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to Maccabi Electra’s complicated football field and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team.
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of employment and teamwork, even if they were waiting for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 triple rated contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the guidance of the Bluerots, who sat at the top of the ad board from the beginning.
As the first four baskets of the Vitoria team already came out of the perimeter, they could already be supposed to have come to the playground with well warmed wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the Álava team decided for Barac’s innate game and for Eliyahu’s game, which was received on his return to the team with pipes and applauses, which is his home to further expand their advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitters already supposed to be that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game has not yet been decided and the Makkabaers wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini helped the "yellow" turn the wheel (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a few trains with safety to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who, with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, to make sure that the three-four-distance (54-67) was displayed on the display.
The Alaves were blown in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take them away from the victory they deserved in the first three-six minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team, and tried to give their team strength again through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitters were placed out because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended itself well, and although the Israelis still retreated in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from offering the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiakos and had to lead him in Group B of the Euroliga, which was characterized by the failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which facilitated the Greeks’ victory.
The team in Málaga was neither afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opponent team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. One aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blended at 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the erection of Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the ad board in their favour in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it was almost strike between the two Americans and Williams Beley.
The Greek team began to finally become warm and its superiority on both half of the game, while the exit of the Englishman Joel Freeland left clear traces at the Unicaja as a result of an injury and the three mistakes that Carlos Jiménez self caused.
Among their players in the inner field and Lithuanian player Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
A removal hunt was impossible
The third game district was distinguished by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, became greater and even managed to compensate for the difference of the match held in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the leadership within the group into the slopes.
Unicaja tried to move away from the many failures and the exit of the injured Scotch Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook’s triple guidance and Lewis’ use, there was some hope on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braking.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to abandon the leadership at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn due to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most advertisements of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users using more than 140,000 jobs available at Trovit in Spain. A form on Facebook is available to users in which they can enter their profession, experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker felt "badly paid on average," said Albert Ribera, responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros that a Spanish earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the net of a cabinet with an annual 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most popular jobs on the Internet in the last three months are the ones of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President deployed from the office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate is officially expired.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the television station TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate will be completed on that day and he must look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back deck of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner) Zelaya assured that he will stay in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker, whom the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to force him.
Thank you very much!
After the most attractive days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising as it is its natural condition, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The equity used to stabilize markets was to pay the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free hand at interest rates moving around zero so that the banks buy assets to be calculated.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been completed and, without challenging their heterodox liquidity policy, began to scatter some sand into the gearbox, as the ECB has already held with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just be witnessing a conversion in reducing risk premiums.
The flights of the exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached in the early year.
The states were forced to nationalize private risks and state debt increases again.
We now rely on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had so far hardly affected this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new review of Spain's rating down.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had again tried to generate awareness of what they had caused by the global economic policy, as they should have led to the devastating effects to which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs had a new day.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was previously anticipated.
A government that hides the state debt, elections and a new government that draws the same string.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary saves from the failure to fulfill its foreign payments earlier this year and thus allows a Euro Member State to no longer fulfill its obligations.
On the contrary, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with the duty to maintain the stability of government funds in the necessity of authenticated measures.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some distractions on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, you don’t have to worry as long as the differences of the state debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences decreased and the Spanish differences continue to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the current predecessors force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenarios for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which, with a Japanese scenario, will not prompt the long-term of the Spanish economy.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is required "caution when driving".

Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first in front of the Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where Spain’s energy supply strategy will be discussed in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave the press some key points on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date by 2030, assuming that current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this is not the case, the investment required would not be up to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, especially renewable energy.
In this case, he estimates that 18,000 MW will be required, under the prerequisite, of course, by other "support energies".
Galan, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has requested, in no case wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "it is clearly placed in this direction in the long term, despite some" individual" measures, as Iberdrola's president said.
Whether it’s like it, Galan believes that you should already make the decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to take it into account.
Ferrovial gets "handling" from Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important ones.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares have signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the investigation of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the authorization of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost $1.7 billion (about $1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high deep are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the eastern coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration has decided for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project in accordance with a business plan set by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortiums consisting of European construction companies competing in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in depth construction.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, Australian Transfield, is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the daughter company of the German construction company Hochdeft, which in turn belongs to ACS), which also owns the native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatization, however, has a barrier to overcome, as you only get access by purchasing a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the high depth or bilfinger companies, in addition to Asian references, which has to be followed by the Spanish builders.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its 30% share in high depth, the owner of the mentioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places this geographical field of highest importance for the industry, in which it is already known as energy supplier due to its activity and in the desalting industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which was commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s unsalting plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to maintain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll track, which is promoted by the Brisbane Town's Office of Infrastructure and Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the moving street in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through the tunnels of Briduban.
The city administration’s schedule provides the award for summer 2010 and the launch of the construction work in December next year.
Even though this toll track will be opened for traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government participates in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia repeatedly awards substantial orders to high depth, who signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fiber cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a quick Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not started yet and high has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has achieved its subsidiary, Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers of length for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company only received this contract a few days after it had received the supplement for the construction work for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experiences in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the reclamation and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two renewals of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies presented to this competition written by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, including TBWA, responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be tasked with the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million punishment for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted the competition on fixed networks and phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for disability in its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority watching the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become backwards.
Application Trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade site from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection on the Internet in order to increase revenues.
Basically, this application site is active by Orange in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 until these seven will be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has been playing in Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed in 1992 as a source of revenue for the football clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, bringing them the third and fifth place in the football clubs that have earned most money in the league.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory with itself, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Weiβe Club is the third place in Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times next to AC Milan.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 ranked fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And that even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third place of the countries that could eat money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bia Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious objection is explained by the complicated procedure for the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairmanship Michel Platini has, estimates that it has 1,090 million revenues through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs who participated in the qualification round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who fought to participate received 3.8 million by their bloody presence, in addition to the €550,000 for each game they disputed.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a decision (400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the eighth-finals receive three million each; the four that came to the quarter-finals are 3.3 million.
The last four gets four million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club gets at least 7.1 million and no more than 31.2 million fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are still the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places assigned.
The last year’s master receives 40% of the money assigned, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has left details about the purchase offer of shares to acquire between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos stocks closed at €1.85, therefore Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuven Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a 15-day period to inform their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos reaffirmed that it has been in contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would reach 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to structure its management.
In the attempt to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and the court of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book audit.
A decision she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all free from polemics because the company has been involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of more than 230 million Sos movement to other companies in the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves further capital over the next few months.
In terms of Salazar’s loan, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) took place before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the displacement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina's public tender submitted by Investment Company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this tender after having been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the lawful laws and can therefore be considered "sufficient" after the amendments of last December 2nd.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 Federico Paternina shares at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95 % of the capital capital composed of 6.142.786 euros in the stock markets of Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been reported that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the tender is concluded and their price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the lawful laws.
New Vehicle Review Programs
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only the CFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops where a reviewer must assess the damage and cost of the repair.
No one accident is equal and calculating the costs of parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and provide them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are created with their products.
The other two companies competing with the Tool Market for Review and Reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex’s sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them provides the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be edited becomes increasingly larger, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations came on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
Once a new car comes to the market, the work starts for companies.
It is a difficult task, because every single one of the thousand vehicle parts must be catagolicized and its price must be entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure advances quickly.
If this is a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information at 99.2% of cars distributed in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the vehicle park driving on the street, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There more than a hundred technicians (usually technicians in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they receive 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but, depending on country, there are also tools for managing scratches or calculating the remaining value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
In viewing the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution for accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is that it will be for customers who use it rarely at a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros a month.
In contrast, each insurance company that makes thousands of opinions negotiated the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it runs from the assembly tape alone on the basis of the driving arrangement number.
AudaGlass is dealing with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for vehicles declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analysis or for the purpose of receiving information about deviations to brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car trademark had to be in the workshop due to pannens or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt estimates, also designed for reviewers and in the same way provides digital images, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the evaluation of damage, pannen or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They collaborate with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 pensioners and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased with 20% annually over the past three years and sales in 2008 amounted to €10.8 million.
Earlier last year, they began to go even on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of their business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Total revenue in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they are at the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor’s reference index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the opportunity to get access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals such as insurance companies, advisors, car rental companies, workshops, scratches and car dealers who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany alone.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3000 ads are managed daily and 100 new ads are added daily on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose number of passengers has been signed off may no longer drive on the roads, but certain un damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars with historic value can be re-allowed even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Cost rate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company ensures that the user receives a cost rate in only four steps: vehicle identification, search for spare parts, creation and creation of a cost rate.
Easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are passenger vehicles, 109 terrestrial vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the repair model has been identified based on the drive chassis number, a graph of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price of the work hours, additional charges or discounts, and then can print the cost rate and pass on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluation such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
