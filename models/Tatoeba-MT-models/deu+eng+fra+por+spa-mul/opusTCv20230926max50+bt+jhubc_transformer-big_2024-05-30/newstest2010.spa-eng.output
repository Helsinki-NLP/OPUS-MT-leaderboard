Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president of history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visiting the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet the five members of the committee, which, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Then, the presidential couple has planned a meeting with King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president who receives him, even though the third who receives him in his position.
The White House has already announced that, on receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and another 250 guests.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize from the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserving it entirely.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take actions.”
Nature Defense accused of blackmail
Police in Litoměřice accused the president of the civic association Společkost ochranců prýrody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature defenders).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, police spokesman Litoměřice Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Nature Defense Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that in Brno the garbage doesn’t separate for nothing.
I think, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely delayed in waste separation, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't get angry with me, but that seems too little.
It is not necessary to mention that elsewhere it is also easy to separate the garbage.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By Vagancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered myself, after a party, to throw a number of glass and plastic bottles to the garbage.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already full of the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which ashames us throughout the republic, and not buying any more containers or offering the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravský kraj.
"Paroubek" budget took money from income and illness subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adding funds for farmers or officials, there may be not enough money in the budget for income, illness subsidies or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those governing in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they believed that the government would subsequently request a loan for sensitive expenses, income or illness subsidies.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay increasingly higher interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce the State’s social subsidies or operating expenses, you have to increase taxes.
To all whom he added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, too to his children.
People don't have to worry about income or illness subsidies, they will receive them, and 1.8 billion of these accounts have disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not lack in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s effort, debt will continue to rise along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer arrive with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity subsidies, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the displacement of money in the benefit of some voter groups, next year five billion will also be missing to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the bidding has already been held and the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The maximum thing you can do is preserve them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cease of the thirty large buildings; the possibility of getting European funds is also in danger, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka warns.
ČSSD proposed a salomon solution for decreasing funds: you will get money from ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a backgroundless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividend is liquidated ecological damage, served to complete the income account, or serve as a reservation for prepared income reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to victims of communism and offences, or for dispute expenses, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay it, says Janota.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, hand over the reserve of the government budget.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Státní Pokladna (State Box), whose price is two billion and has already been initiated. It must allow you to watch online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user, by pressing a key, will be able to switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just pressing one key, you pass from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses above all on the development of computer virtualizator software.
On your mobile you can bring two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between themselves and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the above-mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile technology is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is concerned with hoteliers
Not only are teleski holders in Krkonoše worried about the snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid of booking with commitment.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," said the holder of the information portal Spindl.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a New Year according to their expectations should no longer doubt to book your stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place may try to wait for a few more days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotel hosts offer mainly weekly stays for the year.
I think they will continue to offer, but soon they will give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what is most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remains free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-time Christmas stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí’s travel agency can still offer the New Year’s Day in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are regularly sold.
This year’s interest in winter stays is harmed by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snowfall during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was harder.
We are about five percent better.
For the New Year and Christmas, we have the latest free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s stays are already occupied in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, half of the beds are still free at the latest Janské Lázně hotel on Christmas.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we found about sixty percent of the occupational capacity.
February has been a little weak, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in Krkonoše stays will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, hotel director of Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that Krkonoše hotel lovers will be spent the snow desire waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures should fall and, if there is rainfall, in the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové of the Czech Republic Hydrometeorological Institute.
US: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s comic that Barack Obama, the president with the smartest man’s reputation, as a diligent student repeated the Afghan matter of his predecessor’s strategy, which he himself took for the foolishest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the word "like in Iraq" used several times, but it didn't use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for its own statement: "A new path forward."
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering for civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing is talked about Iraq in the news today.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal, who even despite traditional subordinated relationships, submitted to the undecided rifle at the White House to a tough criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president emptied for three months, but he didn’t think anything better, so he at least deceived the general over 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing Afghan troops in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will be the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricised wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreements are fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces if they are used to change the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, and after him the patriarchal tribal relationships will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocked by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to get worse and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, may believe that the military sent to war to "soon return home," will do some miracle here.
From the political point of view, fixing the date of the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect statement of the U.S. defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don’t know, and they don’t want to explain to their voters, what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: trying to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphly withdrawal of Afghanistan troops.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic reversal to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years lacking for the presidential elections and that’s why there’s still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the hard criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Furthermore, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that they had taken overrisks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it should be undertaken, JPMorgan’s former investor bank officer Douglas Elliott said.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after setting up nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 30 billion) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the entity’s bonuses for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate topic in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax once, with a fifty-percent tax, the bonuses for banks that exceed 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories less physics
Five women, which is a record figure, today in Stockholm, received this year’s Nobel Prize from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden, in specialized categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
Nobel in Chemistry received it by Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosoms.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, received it by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriota Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award-winning received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the receiving money certificate.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million Czech crowns).
In the event that there are several awards in each category, the award is shared to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the Peace, received it today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even though their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is raising his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the next year’s state budget, approved by the deputy chamber Wednesday.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the issues of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finance.
On the appointment, President Radim Ochvat spokesman reported.
About her stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The chamber of members, however, approved left-wing proposals for fund transfers on Wednesday and increased money for official salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they secretly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the one hand, there was a serious conflict of internal policy, and because of this conflict, the future activities of the Fischer bureaucratic cabinet begin to be controversial, whose shape was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Party of Greens.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to stop public debt.
Klaus may but doesn’t have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long been dismissing “the serious problem,” that is, “the unsustainable deficit” of public finance.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be based on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
SDG leader Mirek Topolanek mentioned that the budget is terrifying and that the government should think of its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentences.”
Chief of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying the budget deficit is scary, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday, ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for the next year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new movie by Clint Eastwood, performed by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some criticisms say that the protagonist roles play American actors.
The story talks about sport, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play in Eastwood’s film.
Another important role Matt Damon plays.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being, the fictional president of the US, and even God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African stateman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country.
He believes he is able to join his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong worldwide to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for Mandela’s story to reach the cinemas.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it would be as much as possible as reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be among the frames before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to stretch Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by pressing your hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard rugby world.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally first met with Pienaar at his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made movie."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense ended up acknowledging that near the borders with Norway tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or an air failure occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write “Bulavá” as “a missile that doesn’t fly.”
A missile that doesn't fly but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and is immersed at the same time.
That’s why the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, is likely to actually be the failed “Bulavá”.
Norwegians have equally since the first time failed to be a Russian missile.
Generals this time defend themselves claiming that one cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately faulted in the first stage.
Although none of the launches completely failed, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the 13 were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulavá" one day will fly without trouble and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed annual contract with CSKA from Moscow at age 51
The legendary advocate Viacheslav Fetisov will again be presented at the age of 51 at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly will play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal matters, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, Moscow’s club coach.
It’s still unclear whether the famous player’s return will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of the Russian hockey.
Legendary front Gordie Howe played at the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one-year-old during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The biggest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumph at the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had hits in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hockey Glory Room.
Hyundai fulfilled the unions' requirements. He will cancel all the additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the trade unions declared the emergency for strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The direction, however, wants to agree with the trade unions for this year a further Saturday turn.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, so we propose additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, i.e., it will work in two turns, Vaněk said.
According to Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday’s turn.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the supplementary work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a free day on December 28, i.e., prolonging Christmas holidays on a day, Vaněk said.
Furthermore, all employees on Saturday’s turns will receive money for the journey and for food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of unionists and strikemen, who stopped the manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the additional work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will cancel the emergency of strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists should be held on Monday morning.
Trade unions chief Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that if they commit to meet the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency for strike.
The car factory situation worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously came into strike for frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management found that employees had to work over hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement of emergency strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
In terms of additional work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year requires a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing began last November.
Until last September he manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in HIV viruses
Team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, patients’ life may be significantly extended thanks to a mixture of medications that prevent HIV virus replication in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarbone have effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbones are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the medicines used today, and therefore they can solve the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘better’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedre cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and no mature and infectious body of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press news published by the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry at the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was performed in a test, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbones on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used medications, however, they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medications often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes that metallocarbons are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčova, the head of the Institute of Structural Biology in Biological and Molecular Chemistry.
Fighting for the budget. SDG attacked Fischer, he defends himself
Chief of SDG Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for the next year is "extraordinary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think of his future existence.
The SDG statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it is left time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the chamber of members he wants to rely on the minority, trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDG and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The chamber of members approved the 2010 budget, however, with the left’s amendment proposals, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government rejected SDG proposals as they coveredly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s desire, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten the resignation in case of approval of the amendment proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota, he asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said he is thinking of remaining in the role.
The reason is their disappointment for the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do for the ČSSD nominees, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, whether he will resign, if the chamber approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to illness grants, income, or amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not blamed
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The SDG nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries at the household positions there are people belonging to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which supports the leftist majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies."
However, it will not be able to rely on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven’t thought about that, when it’s time, I’ll take care of it, told journalists in the Deputy Chamber, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of the SDG.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS granted on Prime Minister’s request
Nečas stressed that SDGs in the chamber of members on Wednesday probably would vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask SDG members to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, he replied to the question, if SDGs are not concerned about the absence of the party chief in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn’t realize that my vote was missing.
By resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the next few months it would be above all about bolchevizing the Chamber of Deputies and destruction of all positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will be circulated for almost the same rates
České drahy (Czech Ferrocarriles) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most fees including the basic and customer price will not change.
More chances of links to the capital will win, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendoline carriage.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the line Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice will circulate less quick trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in drahy-planned transportation is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transportation will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the track Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surrounding cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
As of December 13, travellers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year’s regional railway account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive the next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them nearly three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that’s why the prices of a vast majority of tickets didn’t rise.
The changes will take place only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without customer card, ČD Net price will rise from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for travel between two regional cities.
Philippine armies continue to stop more than 50 people, children were released
Armed people have kidnapped 75 people today in the southern Philippines, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was said by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All the 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction occurred in the Southern Agosan province.
They say that about 19 armed people use hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed belongs to the New People’s Armed Force (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously pursued kidnappers due to violence, whose cause was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23th November killing, related to the Governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
For the suspect of the involvement in the killing, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
On Mindanao island, Muslim separatists also operate.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA’s story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days a new Hollywood movie by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a portion of the biography of former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known apartheid fighter plays Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the protagonist role Mandela himself.
The second role, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, played it Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Award for Freedom of Thinking, in 1993 he received, along with the Nobel Peace Prize from Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time, the media are stripped by alarming news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination of inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to this new movie at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of protagonist roles for Hollywood’s “little interesting” stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the paper and prepared me well to play it.
I often met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as it is said - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also dressed the rugby national team and enters the playground. RSA won the World Cup at the time.
By entering the scarf in the suit, which in RSA is considered something almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995, said.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said in an interview for LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformator with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has grabbed in the morning a transformator from the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Vyškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústi region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformator be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire was extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special extinctor matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no wounded, according to the company’s spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the failure does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is turned off.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps’ activity, nothing similar happened, the flaws of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesman of the society ČEZ for Northern Czech Republic, electrical power supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation does not affect the operation of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive holder of the distribution system, of electric driving 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power of the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for calumni to three ČSSD Hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura today will file a denunciation for calumni to three social-democratic Hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the Hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radiožurnal.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České drahy.
All the three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "take the pastas of the cake," however we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say we are more expensive than České drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but defending ourselves.
It is because of the calumni towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnal Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, and he said that no necessary measures have been taken in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
I am naturally prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to other Hitmans to do so as well.
I suppose that it will also be clearly demonstrated that Mr. Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses liars and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radiožurnal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be held against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the charge of about 150 billion crowns did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims he was threatened by a ČSSD member due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we'll be able to lose the bus licenses.
He was presented as a member of ČSSD, I know, what lord it is, I'm not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnal today.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As a first vaccine, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcus vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the highest prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
As of January, the pneumococal vaccine will be given free of charge to children born from August 2 last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third to the fifth month of child age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily left their children vaccination against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns on vaccines annually.
Without clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
Until now, the state has spent all the vaccination of children about 500 thousand a year.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of medium otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Pneumococal infections in our country die each year according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neumococal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine compulsory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, for example, Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Nahlas said.
Its association has spread pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health however does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination procedure.
At this point we did not think of it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatric society Odborná společkost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it can be reasoned about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccine as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, from next year, that more than 80 per cent of young parents will let their babies vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The pneumococal vaccine is a huge change as well because as the first vaccination in children is covered by healthcare companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “sack the money from health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will be nothing easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in the theft of a museum
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million U.S. dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while loading 90 pictures in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The news agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta, a 52-year-old son, declared to police that her father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the pictures into a deposit."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to have granted such permission.
Labour Party defends tax increases in budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the previous budget report, faced with the criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance has also received severe criticism for harming low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals is an increase of 0.5% in social security expenditure and a top of 1% in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
The trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future “problems.”
The increase in social security spending, which will grow around £3 billion a year, has angry on the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the previous report to the budget
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The increase of 1 point in corporate tax for small firms was dismissed
Tax degravations for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £110.
The ministers said their goal to halve the 2013 deficit involved "tough decisions", but insisted that 60% of the supplementary tax burden would be over 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax rises and outlined expenditure cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
“These are big figures, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and how rapidly the deficit is reduced, have been doubted after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75 percent this year, much worse than the 3.5 percent decrease forecast in April, while the loan order would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the projection of loan application for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to submit a credible plan on how they would return the money, added, “cynically” preventing the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
“They have not included anything meaningful about what they will do,” said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. “They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it.”
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insisted that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further shorter-term deficit reduction.
But Democratic liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and expenditure cuts would be used to sustain next year’s expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the time chosen for ads, such as the increase in inflation of some incapacity subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered the next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided with it most needed and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that public expenditure adjustment would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“This is really delaying pain to later,” his director, Robert Chote, said.
“All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. The markets realize this."
FBI inquires about "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating Pakistan’s arrest of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S. last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descendants, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are American citizens, of course we’re going to be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what circumstances they’re holding,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was in awareness of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if they are in fact the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of them's uncle.
He said the house was already in the sight of local police and no charges had been filed against the detainees yet.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on arrests, Reuters reported, but said the US had to “work closer with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuses”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equal to disabilities, according to a report by Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime's "models of abuse" before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes, another said they threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
The officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC’s correspondent in Tehran Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei recognized some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak’s detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
"Fake Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report by Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
“They often beat me in the face,” according to their words.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head...I was threatened to execute and humiliate me."
Amnesty said after five days she signed a false confession and released it and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some detainees after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had existed.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed they held him in a container along with another 75 people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authority had established committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government’s response, but said that the agencies’ mandate and powers were confused and the parliamentary committee’s investigations had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert an interesting site in Bristol into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash awards.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre-length track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the track summit, but it was quite scary.
It looks under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titting.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were given for the best tricks or manoeuvres made on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will leave to melt.
Still they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Laic State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested forbidding the construction of minarets and there is a widespread alert on the alleged Islamization of Europe, an American academic John Bowen has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly laic societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as fans of the author’s last work “Why the French don’t like the veils” (2006), an elegant and detailed study argued about a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen called "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays debates between teachers and students about the questions that most interest them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims teach about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
They are these apparently mundane issues, he holds, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab academic and scholar Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot spread this argument entirely.
The Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen’s interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes Muslim values and French laicism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions how far French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends laicism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “a value adjustment.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The world’s most desolate picture
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing of the complicated history and whale hunting policy, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a 14-year-old brave Cadet, fighting only with the end of his mosque, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The kids, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circus.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the zoo areas are still usually a millionest part of the area of a wild adult’s area. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore has been made green by the algae growing within the areas without hair of its leather.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters present the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Skima motorsnow Indians use high-power assault guns to burst their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist writer, offers a clear and scalowing story about the Arctic science and an overcooking look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of changes.
It's not because of lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering trips at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave signs for the first time on the displacement of ice masses.
The cold war submarines then drawn a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the system affluent inside the Arctic ice, made up of jets of salt water compressed while frozen.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is withdrawn, which is thought can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington graves
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it is us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stoping in different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the New York City Battery Park and on the United Airlines Flight 93 commemorative site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career military.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to pay a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in warm clothing layers, the volunteers walked through the wide grasslands and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older tombs of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the burial pencils.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tied on the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan were buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of current wars invaded the area.
People cryed openly, others prayed, and families and friends relyed on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loudly names sculpted on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose pencils have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who washed the tears of her eyes in front of her son’s tomb.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of marine artillery Sgto, David Shane Spicer, who died in fighting in July.
Nobody should never forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
“Much after my death I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although in accordance with Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incisive blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but permission has been denied.
The detention of an American contractor can probably lead to tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improving relationships with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobile and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where a government worker’s average wage is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are especially used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, press officer at the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in jail in Cuba are among crimes for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly uncertain.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, like free mobile distribution in Cuba, is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called “Nuevo Castro, Cuba itself,” a reference to Raúl Castro’s place as the country’s leader, to replace Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unleashed plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistan’s authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, demonstrating that they hope the case can help unravel a broad network of terrorist recruiters, who run the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case on Saturday said that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing northwest mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke since anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not change and were even trying to obtain appropriate approval to access the al-Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has put the main priority to try to infiltrate people into Qaeda.
The organization’s recruiters act as guards, not let those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda is examining with special attention to American aspiring recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attractiveness, because of their potential to have access to U.S. goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center, more bold actions for the climate.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day that little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked throughout the city holding letters in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish stated, "Earth says "it's enough."
Several famous joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru’s travels, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country should deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but you have to do it, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black clothes placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flames, but they were followed by "a pair of large explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seemed to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, Chief Climate Negotiator of China.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I was really not aware of the situation.”
Then he continued to say in Mandarin, "Since the meeting place is big, I can't hear what happens outside."
He pointed out that it depended on each’s perspective to define whether the march was harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "It can also be said that it affects the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
The federal rating book of last week on performance in mathematics was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performance systems, the rating book showed that fourth and eighth degree students gave a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance difference between African American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average scores of DC white students of fourth grade over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the painting is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black students of fourth grade in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances held by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not giving joy jumps for a difference of two or three points, said DC Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an assistive Rhee’s administration style critic, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
They always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what concerns is that we are not dedicating the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the higher degrees of primary and middle school, who did not master the early reading foundations in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, to which he is credited some of the progress informed by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students below the degree level, Rhee said.
Others say ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to decrease the difference.
Here is a kind of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who study urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to address its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban supervisors, she tries to stick to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We have to strengthen our barrier schools so that all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
We have to reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of her teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers as a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong solution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and climbed for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and smaragd praises.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated in a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-degree students explored Gettysburg, where the enrollment costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of potential student enthusiasts.
This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Wow, seriously?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide spoke of the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not if you are going to university.
The question is what.
Although there is increasing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated at university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the path towards a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performance people say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate trend to succeed.
Many of them also have parents setting high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutorial programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach university, especially if efforts are maintained over time.
Watching low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from infant garden to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to execute college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in the middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent frequenting the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reachs agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a key role in restoring the Iraq oil industry, mutilated for decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with only two of the 10 auctioned houses.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned sites in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of the Iraq oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asian and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will spend a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Safety concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military withdraw, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more strongly in Iraq, which has the world’s third largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases in disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have narrowed ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main landscapes.
We know China is on the road to become a major economic and technological power, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be along with its competitors and meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-elected to submit proposals made offers that then confronted the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each farm.
Al-Qaeda’s main planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A supposed U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a leading al-Qaeda operation planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, an official of Pakistan’s civil intelligence agency said, talking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the place and quickly confiscated what remained from the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al-Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspiracy around the world, a senior official said, who spoke since anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air strikes within the Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the Qaeda Higher Command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly risen in the rows of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not decrease in any way the threat that raised us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-range agents.
The pace of CIA-led non-pilot aircraft attacks has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a count of The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to enhanced tactics by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while implacablely killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. Maximum Envoy in Kabul to Resign
United Nations top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his position in March, terminating with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of corruption extended in Afghanistan’s UN-backed presidential election.
Eide’s exit happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he would support the increase, but he was concerned that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months drives other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We have to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who work with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that it’s better to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism regarding international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate U.S.-led assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
He also pushed UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, lending to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration for the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, suggesting that the U.N.’s fatty hiring regulations undermined its ability to capture talents.
That’s why the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That’s catastrophic and can’t continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” against Iran for his failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, heading to a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that I think is that if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeted to Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He said it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentive", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insisted that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressured for that agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and earn time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of commitment to the United States.
I honestly believe that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before replanning other options, including continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it on Thursday called “unfounded and lacking basic charges” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions continue to be raised between the Kurdish and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and partnerships.
Gates urged both parties to decrease the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 in late August.
Gates also sought to relieve Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. U.S. officials cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave them.”
In a ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters that preached them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children" and "one more baby means another tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the old population of their city, they suddenly changed their way this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, a 31-year-old human resources manager with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after a single child’s policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously reputable children, single malcried, affectively called “small emperors,” a demographic crisis in the country is emerging.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six of when the policy became effective, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of 60-year-old and more residents is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, which is far above the overall average of approximately 20 percent.
Imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly population and mitigate a future labour shortage."
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the country’s constitution in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have approved politics for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually undermined their position on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife were only children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be suitable to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures below the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the answer has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing answer
Although rural town officials outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the most urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want any more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his 26-year-old wife, Liu Juanjuan, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese people, they have only insufficient health and living insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social protection network, they hold, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological motives for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wants a single child because she was also so: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone to take care of us.
We’re not used to care for others and really don’t want to care for others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more contundently.
For parents with two middle-class races, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about to succeed enough to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years old grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best child care when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest level of life, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group draws out a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging postures and mutual recriminations, caught a renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the load on their shoulders in the short-term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is leaving timeless, with more than 100 world leaders that will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text doesn’t talk about how much money the rich countries would give the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN’s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as “the great picture.”
It shows profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was presented the same class of verbal artificial fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims requesting mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a harder line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries move forward and take steps, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common feeling,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically face global reheating.
With the future economic path of the world’s leading powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most brave action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should cost the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to pressure on a legally mandatory treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that the talks will produce as high as a political agreement.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "set political pressure on the whole political process," in part because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most exceptional issues should be solved before the heads of government were able to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, went down from the aircraft and ran to the Bella Center halls, to closed door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims to be arbitrated next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, activists playing the guitar present night shows mocking out of the countries they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for Global Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train 225 km/h from Britain redefines the feeling of Monday
At 5.13 p.m. on Monday morning, a silbido will drill the darkness to indicate a train departure that marks a revolution for travelling in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes as a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Secretary of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected apart zones would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would shorten, and the shift of aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still stop Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a range of five meters in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a broader high-speed network towards the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninus to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," a railway member said.
Once finished, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km/h, turning the British network to the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to support 400 mt-length trains capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal able to receive 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to fit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a switch from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a £75,000-orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, earned the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange he built in his electoral district house.
The party’s prisons spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the members were living “rations,” increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build a framed oak extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the supplementary interest, summing hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the requests at their time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of the expenses of members. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the planes as an "orange".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee absolved him from violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was calling for approximately 1,400 pounds monthly in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland’s mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the £75,000 loan.
The BRE standard variable mortgage rate dropped from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, which is now found.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as chairman of the House opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the members had to survive "rations" after the expenditure scandal.
“Basically this is nationalized, you have to live from rations and be treated as m**rda.”
He said, “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don’t do it.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenditure in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this " could be considered excessive."
An activist caught a hole with the shape of the symbol of the Sterling Pound in Mr. Duncan’s grass as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the wage office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about eviting and criminal or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be clearer or simpler in any way.”
Come those who have faith, to see the Brighton Beach Palace Adventure calendar
Brighton’s palates have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Adventure calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each day of December, using villancics as their subject.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last step from 17.30 a.m. to 18.30 a.m. daily, with filled cakes and ponche served free of charge.
So far elected villaincians include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palate presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
The 50-year-old Martin Poole, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is a unpaid clergyman of the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond.
“We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we expect as a church that people come to an old strange building? I think the church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Adventure of the Palap calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to test and represent it through spirituality.”
Massive weather mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday as a claim for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Approximately thirty thousand people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the Danish frozen capital in claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change must reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, increasing climate mobilization worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen to be very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke out showers with hammers, a journalist reported.
Anti-disorders police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, she said, it is especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were "without distinctions" detained, emphasizing that one hundred of them were "immobilised on the street on Saturday night and sitting in spite of the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
Demonstrators stopped approximately 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candled awakening.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from the large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, the majority with heavenly dishes responded forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we took the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying, there’s time, said Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, water courses you can walk through as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
France’s European Deputy José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “unite climate justice and social justice”: “Today the fight against global warming does not oppose the struggle for another world.”
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial score on demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dress and shine clothes with slopes in favour of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act strongly against climate change were formed.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatists Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounced "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Osetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Electoral tables closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to Abkhazia Electoral Commission officials, the share was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in race, including the outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved vote scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili "asserts that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousands of deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that he is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted to Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Sookhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sunny landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for Moscow’s support, and very particularly for the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one who gives Russia control of the abjack railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen, where police in alert arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Around thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, parade in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peacefully, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
Demonstrators stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, not attempting to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candled awakening.
A few minutes after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke bricks and hammer displays, an AFP journalist reported.
The anti-distortion police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, pulling several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people specifying that they were primarily members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquin, and four cars were burned near a busy house during the incidents that led to arrest about twenty people, police say.
The extremist groups did not remove their eyes, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the helicopters of the order forces flew over the area.
Most protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, the majority with heavenly dishes responded forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we took the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippine militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization along with the former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial score on demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dress and looked up clothes with slogans in favour of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act against climate change were formed.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday Informativo (JDD, according to his French sigla) that history and geography would be "fortleced" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from mandatory teaching in the second year of scientific bachelor's.
From now on on, all the students of the first bachelor’s degree will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "based on hypocrisy" because, he says, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch," but "in general, it calls the best students."
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be subrames of the C, he continues even emphasizing: “I didn’t even hear that historians or intellectuals were angry for eliminating history and geography in second bachelor’s schools.”
An IFOP survey published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven of ten French (69%) disapproved the government’s project to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography secondary C Bachelor’s. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticised this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "it's not talking" about eliminating philosophy from the secondary bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended teaching reform, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), early year will be given an admission test that will target their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year against the classroom as teachers of practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education."
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge he accepted Saturday morning, Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Expert Group on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey them to know more, he explained in the framework of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the school pond fish.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts in their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he emphasized waiting for the public to understand that “the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific file.”
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s internet site from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is forecast for February, followed by others at a bimestrial pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, actions are expected to be taken
Prison guard trade unions called on Friday to a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and extra hours, which was delayed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Worker Force (2nd guard union) asked out-of-service staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "lock them" to thus denounce the theft of their households.
The Penitentiary CGT (the 3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", since it is "shameful and unacceptable" the breach of payment in December of the "extra hours, night prizes, Sundays and holidays" working in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase dissatisfaction and anger."
The Office of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted, but they ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions ensuring that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours will not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa declared.
It is a true scandal, Marseille’s interregional FO union announced his decision to boycott up to a new order “all meetings and calls.”
The staff will not work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with the extra hours, also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase our tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare attack staff wages, the Burdeos Penitentiary CGT estimates.
According to trade unions, not in all regions the same happens, as some are more lucky than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he does "better gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: "I'm doing better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC channel will issue on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they are thinking of celebrating the end-year parties at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be on the match.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program extracts broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," he said provoking the president.
It was true, he was forced to admit it before answering humourly pointing to the First Lady's bead necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the an hour interview, in an atmosphere extended to the famous encourager who devotionally supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gifted him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to meet us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I heard that he had given me that ball.
On the other hand, the First Lady reminded her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, however, I loved that doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he is in coma induced
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "low control" according to his allegates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again on Wednesday to Thursday night at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked “injuries derived from the operation” of hernia disc carried out in Paris on November 26, noted his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries “need a repair operation.”
However, the singer’s press service tried to convey tranquility claiming that the situation was “under control,” and reported that a new medical party would communicate within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, being subjected to an induced coma to avoid “pains and complications.”
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about his state, RTL adds.
The press service, interrogated by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic at Monceau Park due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the art environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday’s close friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was “a bad time,” but said he didn’t make “a problem” because the rocker is “a fighter.”
I called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a fool to get twelve hours of plane after such operation, it is not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to reassure by claiming that Johnny Hallyday “reacted satisfactoryly to antibiotics” and that the infection was “controlled.”
Camus said he had talked to Laetitia, the wife of the musician, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer’s health problems were multiplied since July when he was internated for nine days after a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed to have been operated from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is exaggerated. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on scene.
In mid-November, his associates had even to deny a new internation.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first title of Bousquet in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the 2009 World Cup with long swimming pool, won an international title on Thursday at a distance by which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were overcome when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who desired the world's record in 50 m free, brand that owns in a long pool (20.94).
At one of the two queen distances of swimming, at 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed at 20'53 during a final where they competed ten swimmers instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet went forward to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to drop the world brand (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane bathers from January 1 will be prohibited.
These bathers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, ended their epopey in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his brand at 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up thoroughly in this race.
I knew this time I wouldn’t be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A panel of sarcophagus belonging to Zola sold in $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, Sotheby's art walker announced.
This 2 meters long panel for 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysiac scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by sathyrs and ebrious women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions from ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's, explained on Tues.
It sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but until now, this lot was the most shot by buyers, undoubtedly, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was found that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared subsequently in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as element of her bathtub in her particular Paris mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Mariscal Pétain to take power.
For about fifty years, his place was uncertain.
Revising the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted departure from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the goal government denied the safeconduct.
At the moment, after a phone talk with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday to El Salvador to take to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the goal government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and request political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to get to Mexico as a guest-in-exercise head of state.
The goal government “suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...) they wanted me to present my resignation,” Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, he added playing a couple of accords the deputy president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico submitted a safeconduct request, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing asylum requests, Golpist Government Interior Minister Oscar Raúl Matute said Wednesday to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, replied Manuel Zelaya in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as President of the Honduran people, he said.
The rumors about the departure of Zelaya on Wednesday mobilised supporters of the deposit president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, strongly based by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the Golpist government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, day he had organized a referendum to prepare his reelection, rejected by the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and refugeed at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must respond to justice for the crime of “high betrayal,” according to the goal government.
De facto President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, he elected Porfirio Lobo, which was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until its mandate ended on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are faithful witness to both the U.S. and its partners' economic reactivation: the Dow Jones won 0.67 percent; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final closure figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.58 percent (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotic, he said, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-filled glass."
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, "this reflects an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit dropped 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular goods exports, which reflect the growth of major economies that market with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants “was the lowest for a year,” said Scott Marcoiller, at Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bonus rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year Bonus to 4.492% against 4.408% on eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power abuse the "Ladies de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power abducted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration that a dozen dissidents were convened.
About forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro while walking towards the center of the capital claiming the release of those detained, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankies died, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!", with the handle up the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian dressed agents who came to "protect them."
Eve, a similar demonstration disappeared against the "Ladies of White" in Havana, without wounded or arrested.
But in the Haban neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who was also prepared to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, was arrested by civilian police officers, AFP journalist said.
The agents forcedly climb to vehicles to dissidents who were slaughtered by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in such circumstances only lasts for a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded the 2005 Sajarov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners," about 200 according to the disidence, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a 20-year prison penalty.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom follow the shells.
The Cuban authorities turn opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" to the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Done very rarely in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “counterrevolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of footing rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An injured killer of an octogenary with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the biggest flow in the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have hit with two knives and for yet uncertain reasons, an elderly, in the pharmacy or in front of the pharmacy in the No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, police and witnesses reported.
Following the serious wounds, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union official Alliance.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of this, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elderly died.
The life of the other wounded, with the apparently affected vital organs, is at risk.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fault and was internated "in a shock state," a police source said.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the Jean Jaurès boulevard.
Apparently randomly, he would have injured two other pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene remained unclear.
He was armed with two meatmaker knives wearing crosses on his back, an Alliance union official in the Seine Highs, Arnaud Pressé, explained in place.
Several transitors, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to the testimony obtained by the AFP.
I saw a thirty-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn’t succeed because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a nearby bar worker.
A crowd was thrown on him, including a police officer who broke his doll, he added.
By the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were injured, according to police testimony.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous stores are found.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old lord on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I perceived a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person approximately 35 years old came with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Attorney's Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Sena Court Police (SDPJ 92).
The crazy was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention he did not say any word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of entering him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to master him in the Clichy police station where he was moved.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all of this type of disturbance whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer asks the cause to be dismissed again
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who dismissed the cause against his customer, who is under home arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurring more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director of "The Pianist" attorney, denounced before three judges of the appeal chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural mistakes at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel declared: I claim that the charges are disregarded at the same time, since the conduct of the judge responsible for the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "has resulted in scalour."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (failed since then) would have talked with a prosecutor who would have commented to him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison prior to judgment, which constitutes a serious lack of proceedings.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), of the prosecutor's own mouth, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "haver lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court refuses the rejection of the case.
The accusation, on its part, reiterated the argument exposed in the first instance, i.e., that no rejection of the charges could be seriously assessed as Roman Polanski would not be presented to the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was dictated for "illegal sexual relationships" with a young age under 13.
Since then, he never walked the United States again.
Los Angeles District Vice Vice President Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "has to be here to present in the audience."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is the possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favour to the court, although despises her authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the cause against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s attorney, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his customer no longer stands to harass her every time the Polanski case resurge, and adds: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by American arrest order.
After more than two months after the shells, he was sentenced to home prison in his Gstaad cottage, waiting for an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses the road and breaks for the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without direction, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closure figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average raised 65.67 points reaching 10.471.50 points, while the technological component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to be 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained so until the end of the year.
The trend remained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “help improve the market’s opinion regarding the strength of economic reactivation,” analytics summarised Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November per second consecutive month and greater than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumers’ trust was visiblely recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were stopped by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads to the lowest sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury Bonus yield rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year Bonus to 4.497% against 4.492% on eve.
Miss World's choice again in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are in the final straight to fulfill their dream: being elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of 1 billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surrounding of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revolt.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone said amazed.
This nineth-time tournament in South Africa will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17.00 a.m. (15.00 a.m. GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to give my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have been alive twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering “African landscapes that take off the breath.”
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of every woman is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, Miss India declares with a great smile.
According to the organizers, the music and the dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a bathtub.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former Queen of South African Beauty, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will conduct the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with difficult warmth and pride to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, who narrowed their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
Your best memory will certainly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I tried people who never thought to get to know.
Probably returns to the 2010 World Cup, she says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he dropped from the aircraft that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 hours local (21 hours GMT).
The singer's son said he would move "as long as early as" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the disk hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "induced in coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus managing his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been undergoing a coma induced by physicians at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, sequel to a disk hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laetitia went Friday morning to French school in Los Angeles, whom his daughter Jade attended to witness a school act, AFP photographer confirmed.
Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be next to the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic at Parque Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were angry, Camus said.
It is talking about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with Paris surgeon's authorization."
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured that there was no problem in doing the trip, as I was operated twice with disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer appeared to have “gone without cannula, without anything,” after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
She operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened by actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of brain bleeding.
He is a doctor with bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for malpractices, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a scriptless man" accused "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention was "done without any inconvenience" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
No doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as expected, I seem very risky, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its sigla
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) by François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Acquisition Offer) on the sigla of the former Giscardist party, inviting him to withdraw it from all support.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he believes that François Bayrou was not in the position of defending his political heritage after he has set his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
As a support for his management, he received the assistance from Mr. Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by François Bayrou’s friends who don’t want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the member inviting them to renounce the sigla and transfer the property rights of the brand to them.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe properly to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'our in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, hold the signatories of the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the sigla, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any support, as well as from (his) website.
She also asks Hervé de Charette to "transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate owners".
If not, justice will be appealed to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they say that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the UDF sigla.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 for three years to join the MoDem and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continues the office, "when he registered the brand," he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years," but of the UMP.
Use scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking out of the NC strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthwhile to get their own name than attempting to get out of anonymity fraudulently by taking a name that is not entitled to.”
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of multibillionary Liliane Bettencourt claims, it took advantage of the weakness of the octogenary to expoliate her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for weakness abuse, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and €375,000 a fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputed the rides of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to be undergone a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's inheritance and leading shareholder has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Attorney's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday must deliver a report before March 10, 2010, in which they must report whether Liliane Bettencourt had weaknesses and during what periods.
I think you'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer Georges Kiejman, when he left the hearing.
On the other hand, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer Olivier Metzner was pleased with the court’s decision.
It is a great news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated criminal action against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, by checks, life insurance contracts or artworks.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer who considers him a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the proceedings by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations sometimes resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary who said she was distrusted by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, “I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I could never talk to Françoise again.”
On the other hand, the Prosecutor of Nanterre once again considered that the complainant was unable to attend, as much as a guardian judge in recent days refused to take place on her request to open a judicial guardian proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to attend justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
Nobody else will be able to appear in his place,” said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would be pronounced after the trial on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the leadership of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees to adhere to “values” specified from above as before it was about imposing products on consumers thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that do not relate to customers’ preference factors is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demobilization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to have proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it needs employees a commitment that entirely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion surveys, such as Orange’s questionnaire among his employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Lastly, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient conductive theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “commands” of executives’ commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanical management position, inadequate to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses implies adopting a finalistic view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into every reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for the employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
Studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate the management of human courses "to the place".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: For the "fair war" Obama receives praises from the right
On Friday, the U.S. right, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States, acclaimed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the Obama award on October 9, this time applaud the presidential speech, just like Sarah Palin, former Vice-President candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, principal figure of the Republican party’s right-wing to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had addressed the theme of the war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing that Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself on Thursday in Oslo to justify the resort to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words, was pleased.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich declared, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, which some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased by listening to "a left president" when he recalled members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current chronist at the Washington Post, Obama spoke “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as "always doing it," he "spoke as a US president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a safety bubble they didn't create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few not very convinced rights, a halcon of Bush's era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech as "monoton, pretentious, and lack of inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left center press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Time, although he continues to believe that Obama was awarded Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech “superproduction” especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the Californian newspaper excited.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” said the New York Times, judging it “at the same time as dark and build-up.”
Railroad transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three Marathon negotiations, road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organisation that remained until the end, arrived Friday afternoon at an agreement that ends the strike signature and the threat on Christmas supply.
During the signature session on Friday night, Transportation State Secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators dismissed Friday’s dawn, hoping to quickly sign the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employer organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by carrying a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours starting at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 18 a.m.
The conflict "has been very harmful to businesses" and "it was afraid that it would disturb the end-of-year parties," Bussereau said.
The text foresees a 4% increase for lower wages (in local and regional road transportation), and a 2.9% increase for the highest (international transportation).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in supply centers.
But there may always be some disliked rebellion, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", though it was "tough to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “a historical agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment."
The agreement also provides for an increase in displacement expenses of 3% and the conclusion of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will primarily enable to address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “a €100 million low in employer burdens” was subject to a government amendment in the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will request the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply, first of all, to the enterprises attached to this organization and, second of all, to the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "in the shortest," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employer organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naive business," as the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wish to eat powder at the next Christmas dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts "the stability of many SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months at risk."
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions discording with RATP proposals
Conflicts in the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and trade unions were unsatisfied with regard to their premium order.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will circulate between 10 and 20 p.m., at a ratio of one train each on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train each four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to switch train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that “RATP strives to provide service to big stores.”
The RER crosses from west to east the Paris city.
The RATP track runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circulated in tip hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as expected.
There was no disorder in the Andeans on Thursday thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competing than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had “waken up an hour and a half earlier to reach schedule.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and order forces.
The RERs A operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with destination to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join metres.
New general assemblies of strike workers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, and the results will be analyzed, "not satisfactory" according to trade unions, from a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers want to claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals among parenteses, the CGT commented outraged, noting that the direction “was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved.”
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to conduct “a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession,” RATP said.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "doesn't care the users of the weekend."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which until then was denied to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have submitted a notice.
The unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the Prokurd Party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main prokurd party, a decision that immediately caused anger in the Kurdish community, southeast of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government’s task, which has just pushed a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that affected the independence of the State and its indivisible unity,” the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, and added that 37 of the party leaders, among whom are his President Ahmet Türk and Ms. Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the party’s assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that the members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision arises following a proceedings launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the “principes” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization for Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict intervenes at the time the government tends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen their rights, so that the Kurdish should stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a solution could cause tensions in the Southeast Anatolium, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan’s detention conditions degenerated in clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators met in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large Southeast cared mostly populated by Kurdish.
The Order Forces threw tear granates and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with honds.
In Istanbul, approximately 100 people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk claimed that the decision of justice would “deep up the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, composed of a party coming from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closing of parties.
Therefore, nothing is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision entirely boycott the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
We can expect, of course, a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in North Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It’s at all something you want to make life impossible for citizens, comments the winter road maintenance director of the FES.
But with this, your employees can learn how to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as heavily snow in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
Main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the firefighter body, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3 p.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which better adheres.
That’s why the FES starts around 3 p.m., “with that the paths are free until the traffic of the tip hours begins.”
The difficult thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“Then we have a problem,” says the road maintenance director in winter, “because then no one is ready to clean space to vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touchs the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
This is where the discomfort is generated, well know Brauburger.
About five o'clock in the morning it starts the FES infantry, mainly dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Usually, the FES could not take care of the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight primarily to the bridges, said Brauburger.
As these rapidly slide, the salt vehicle is running as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The dinosaur's kidney
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivore dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-tall animal running over the two strong rear legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with knife-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogic relationships, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in 2006 in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, this is something unprecedented for Triasic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, they gathered the remains of five specimens in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional find: "Dinosaur fossils of the Trias are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaurs experts don’t share all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn, for example.
According to the current opinion stream, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogic lineages: the carnivore theropodes among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the sauropodes to the birds, the sauropodes to the "long hair" and their relatives, and the Ornischia.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropode.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also possess the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae also the bones of the spine were obviously filled with air partially.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive airbag theropode, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the relative line of later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the sauries emerged there for the first time.
Consequently, the three genealogic lineages were separated in the beginning and spread from South America to all the corners of Earth, which at the time still formed a unique earthly mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other theropods not very intimately related.
The three cannot descend from a single relative predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration waves to North America have been given, comments Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in current Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion might give a distorted picture, because in South America simply many dinosaurs fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there’s barely something to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare sideline of reptiles to the dominant ground vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
While in the Triasic, dinosaurs still shared their life space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosaurians and many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triasic, the dinosaurs expanded throughout the world and developed many new species, while relativeness extinct at the border of the Triasic towards the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, said Martin Sander.
A massive extinction could have been given to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brake the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasic and since then carried a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers participate from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police displacement from the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt impacted around the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe, North and South America, they are solidarised with students in protest at Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police displacement promoted by the Board of Directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, dislodged the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike last week, because the walls and artworks were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The displacement represented an “inacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimate and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Board has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
The teachers require immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protests
The young people of the Verdi union and the German union federation are also solidarised with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of an increasing concern for the future itself, says Verdi’s national juvenile secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen’s Minister of Science, defended, however, the acting of the university and police director.
We are grateful to the university rector.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an Aktuelle Hour issue on Thursday in the parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are comprehensive with the protest, but we are not comprehensive with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of studying the arguments and requirements of the students, they are dismissed.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strongly guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives have contacted Riedberg’s scientist headquarters in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were held and now, Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Narrow Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
Vice Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Center.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research companies and institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortiums and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were settled.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed for anything high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simple and flatly dealt with "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at the time fossils of the 19th century engineering, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, as formerly a huge amount of time was needed to engage the locomotives backwards.
Rotating, stop dry continuing the journey; but this should be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which lies approximately half the route of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course have no further input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 including the new built ICE frame towards Ulm will already be initiated.
Federal and community politicians have arranged this.
The railway follows, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic carry the taxpayer and not the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time, the competition of low cost flights was not given.
But modern transport policy must first be taken to strengthen goods transport, since rail transport is considerably more ecological than truck transport on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is sure that in the next decade money will lack in other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rin Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-step layout is built.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator as appropriate.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rin Valley will be the bottleneck for international goods transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in Wiesbaden’s autonomous parliament if it is going to file a appeal to the judgment on the ban on night flights from the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts the legal investigation of the VGH judgment, over 400 pages, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had writtenly founded that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing track at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to regulate the ban on night flights again.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as the federal government foresees, would not be conciliable with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, whether it is going to file the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal to the nation’s administrative court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to comply with their promises of prohibition of nightly air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It’s quite difficult, if one left to fulfill his word, Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP slogan “We fulfill our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gumbel’s rejection, which the federal government would be trying through law-tergiversation and tricks still getting their night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would need a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
We need a legally unattachable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the claims of its group about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks return aid.
The large American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned once the aid that Tarp's bank rescue fund had been borne to it from a total of 45 billion (approximately 30,000 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the US CNBC.
This means that the institutes intend to release themselves from the restrictions that had gone out of hand with the acceptance of money, such as limitation in payment of bonuses to directors, as well as payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had achieved approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of rubbers.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked on Wednesday night especially U.S. taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult moments.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the investment bank’s absorption in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money on the capital market in order to be able to free from its obligations against the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce its capital increase by $20 billion by Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick election
At the end, everything was faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Board (German television channel) pressed the writing chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his position, the channel may present a successor.
Yesterday the board was intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it also surely influenced no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved either in the administrative council.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the board support.
The outcome of the vote was not yet concrete at the closure of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for five more years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destitution was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the writing chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious writing chief with the argument, that under Brender's direction ZDF information would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he flagged political influence on the ZDF.
Ultimately, 35 public law specialists had even been involved in the debate, who qualifyed the proceedings of Koch as unconstitutional.
But it didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanic philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "today-journal" information.
Next seasons: 1988 to 1990 staff reporter of the writing head; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after Brender’s destitution, which was still elected as a journalist of the year on Wednesday by the media magazine “Medium Magazin”.
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhine-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retreat of supporting politicians from the ZDF control boards was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the board for Brender's destitution.
Thanks to this journalistic independence test, Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of writing head without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving him the post to a secure supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is anyway awarded to the left liberals.
The university races are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally ceded. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in degree and master cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the examination load: basically each race module must finish with one exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to guarantee a "real and justificable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to more flexiblely making the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master races.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of universities are continuously talking about improving the ability to perform and successfully complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time it was talked about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to dramatically reduce the amount of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," is stated in a 30-page document, which intends to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, thus explained the director of the Accreditation Board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in the future, “studiability” must be the decisive criterion in configuration.
Modules and content should be examined thoroughly as to unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
The courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would be worth new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take to 2015 to examine all the races.
The responsible for this would be at the entire country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of matters and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Renania-Platinada provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement student tutoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a race model.
The configuration of the career should become more flexible, as well as ensure recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of the next year, it is intended to examine all the races about its "studiability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed once again the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Besides the praises there were also criticisms about decisions.
In the Federal Board of Directors of Juso (young socialists) university groups, it was required that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be made "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the strikes of education, now students as major involved should be able to consider as well.
Margret Wintermantel, chairman of the university directors board (HRK), gave student support: “We need student experience,” he said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the union of education and science (GEW) Bonn’s agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s career.
Furthermore, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study seats for Master with the best possible study conditions.
The federal states have to hire a lot of more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled," says the first line of a poem from the lyrics Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he subjects the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner gave several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he was director of the Hesse literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he should talk quite on Tuesday during a Munich meeting about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured from his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate against colleagues of German-Roman writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the presents in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts began slowly in early 1971.
"I'm therefore someone who didn't defend himself enough against attempts to provoke fear of the Security," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time with Herta Müller’s Nobel Prize for Literature and her literary controversy unparalleled with the dictatorial domain mechanisms, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken for a case that evidenced the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, which is known so far, not only author, but also victim.
In his file of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner’s confession, and emphasized the positive influence for him by Walter.
He had excused him or defended him in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner’s statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote already in July in the weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page file.
The people involved will certainly have speculated and in some cases known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the deal with the Securitate control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficulted in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the documents of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the documents since then was rather drawn up.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize of Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former chief of the Securitate in Temesvar spoke despectively of the condecored.
"She has psychosis," in the end they interrogated her only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, such as so often when there are silent guilt.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession lets us expect that the continuation of this story will be ruled more by the anxieties of knowledge and not so much for the attribution of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize of Literature, it is more than just a note at the foot.
The Champions League as a garnison to fill the stomach
When the new Stuttgart VfB football team coach, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his equipment, approached a Mercedes Class C taxi a quarter hour after midnight, it made the impression that an elegantly dressed member of the outdoor service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the manufactor of sport sports would have brought.
The man of the calva characteristic had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was also not drunk of joy.
It had been a nice night, but tomorrow it would start the job again.
Or I would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reach the eighth finals," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves blind for success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" was waiting for them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lucky
The eighth finals of the Champions League (inside parties on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return parties 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy of Babbel’s successor was limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in a short time had inspired the discouraged professors of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willing to deliver themselves and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, soul repair Gross explained his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but with the therapist Babbel had no longer had had any effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a pause of several weeks due to a injury, immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this was what it had missed, obviously, when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense because of a lack of relief and totally overwhelmed of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, gave Khedira to think.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which gateway Jens Lehmann had granted.
There are decisions that make others, not Jens, faced Heldt’s hard criticism.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the Board, which had decided to change his coach for the pressure of adolescent fans.
Also that his free day after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called him a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” replied Heldt, and announced consequences for the Zaguer.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with all the others that without previous efforts with the replaced coach’s team, the spectacle of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a significant participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the unison; and the man of the plastic bag also agreed.
World Heavy Weight Championship Fight
Ardent duel in Bern: Kevin Johnsonn was again and again provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a heavy-weight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC Association version won on Friday to Saturday night in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the nochee that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to give up due to his injuries.
Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
Ahead of about 17,000 spectators at Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower than before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was repeatedly avoiding the world champion's strikes, so Klitschko could not decisively lead to his dangerous right-hand target.
In general, Johnson’s passive did too little for a retaker, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his shots rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who held twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retainer had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "known to do nothing."
When weighing, the champion was allowed to provoke Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he won then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his “belt” from the WBC, which he had before had to deliver without fighting.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola, from the United States.
In this fight I only got one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all the four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion in the WBO and IBF associations.
The belt, however, belongs to the British David Haye, after he destroyed Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters high in November.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is supposedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal opposition attack: the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, called a liar to the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, due to false information about the Kunduz matter.
The SPD and the leftists require explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz’s airstrike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), having deceived with knowledge of cause.
In Saturday's news broadcast "Tagesschau", broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knownly had not said the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been revealed that this attack was not only about destroying kidnapped trucks but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. air strike, asked by German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to NATO investigation report, were killed or injured by up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to pronounce immediately in front of the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the chancellorship, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and her colleague of the green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected criticism.
The chancellery did not influence any concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there had also been doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It was officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden delicate details to the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-range officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeinerer Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer until now, he said.
The ministry did not demonstrate on Saturday regarding its reproach, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's investigative committee, which will be established next Wednesday.
Category: Onyric worlds
In the state of awakening, some people see pictures and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental ill and drug addicts the limits between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are sleeping in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves without impediments to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during awakening, or sees and hears things that others don’t see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniatic.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mental sick or in the drugs.
The fault has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design homes, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality be drawn off.
Onyrically modified states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, and in the worst case, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of mystical Hildegard von Bingen can be referred to similar processes, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of shaman possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of neural communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been broken down and the interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often, complex hallucinations and insane thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between crazy and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since the ancient era.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in a wake-up state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of crazy with the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, this dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproposed, forms."
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a bitch.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mugs like blood, deforms, screaming their teeth.
They are pursuing him, hit him with heavy and flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains throughout the body.
Stretching and malignant voices sounds from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offense him.
Henning T. removes two cables from the stereo, tie them to form a hanging knot, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
It goes up in a nozzle and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope is released.
What a lesson for you!, the voices scream in a choir that the timpanos breaks down her, "Go to the clinic and make them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, as well as maniac-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
She has learned to live with her illness, she has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times those affected can no longer distinguish between the outer and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of greatness, disorders in relationship, or persecutional mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
Schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, he enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remain in principle such as.”
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of exception may lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There is apparently a genetic arrangement for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinant factors.
The researchers suppose that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the detonants of a psychosis when there is already a prior arrangement.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitter system.
When the brain warms up
The unlogic thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has collected reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unseren Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompany symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as limit personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and cranioencephalic trauma.
In a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
It arises when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are little inhibited; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are missing.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love evil or other exceptional brain states.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents said they had experienced a hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to a high school.
A common girl.
If not for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it happens that a crazy boy with long and dark hair directs him the word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her surprisedly; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and goes and hears that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bank next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a load.
When he is in class he cannot sometimes follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations visiblely and hearingly.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to get the sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, you don’t know to distinguish whether you’re awake or dreaming, whether the images you see, the mugs or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of your eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, screaming to the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they'd think he's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. Today is 20 years old.
He approved selectivity last year and lived with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you’ve entered into contact with psychologist Kasten via the Internet, you know you’re not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after some time he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes the same care of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at age 13, he learned that the man whom he calls father since he has been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real.
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ in the fundamental ones of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as irreal.
Kasten recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Heidelberg’s doctor and chief physician at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhaus Hospital’s psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful illness, but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it was a dream.
Onyric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot distinguish from being awake.
Onyric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience a motor paralysis being fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a very imaginary world that is uncoupled with reality.
A form of limited situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inconsistent situation itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink in nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his oniric experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness embarked on several days’ journeys after an operation of heart-transplanted valves, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself pushed in bed, an elderly man on board a sanatorium in a train, a robot sail for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles producing narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow-firn and met a Korean mafioso.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will take over the editorial at the age of 27
New editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, Spiegel said.
100% of the holding will also be in the family’s hands.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm willingness to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to Spiegel.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained for that.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of their children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the board’s presidency from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
At the beginning he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was responsible for the treasury and thus came the responsibility for the company’s assets. After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he was also responsible for direct marketing, foreigners, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the cuspide of the editorial.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who was currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the family’s hands.
With a look at Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe either from the decay: "This has always affected families who leave themselves to be infected by the search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "deliries of greatness," Burda says.
I don’t look like a political preceptor in this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with the “Time” in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Complete Beauty
Everything you can desire – in the matter of beauty and well-being – in the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Mall of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the 8th floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation - Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetic, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the theatre stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while looking at the beautiful views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a champagne copy are some of the possibilities Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also features these machines, in addition to virtual ‘trainers’ who are guiding the steps of customers, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if after exercising our body, we want to pass through hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals for hair recovery, brightness or personal nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electrical company Endesa, together with the City Hall of Barcelona, have created the 'Live Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Electric Vehicle Deployment Logistics) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements about mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what the transport of the future will be.
3 'Electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to drive the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has actively a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sights "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country's leading export sector.
In the presentation of the Government Chairman ' s Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has taken throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closing some of our major productive plants," the president said.
“Thanks to this plan and the disposal of the brands to continue in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our leading export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), aimed at 800 million projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the governmental demand support measures, in connection with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Hall of Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine munt.
This initiative will be held on 5-7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exposure area of 20,000 square meters where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all types related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will include, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sale; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Mercedes Benz specialist Cochera Classics.
Skill tests in the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit enabled outside the trade fair.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sports is not thrown up with respect for the environment.
Therefore, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the stop and start-up system of the engine – built as i-Stop – a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the termination of the vehicle, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving station, we prove that the front buckets have excellent ergonomics and fastener.
Also, the touch of the wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument painting and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and flashing colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, to which the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitacle, this compact Japanese features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a wide baggage and regularly shaped.
The engine’s automatic stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter gasoline engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six-marches.
This engine is a genuine delight. Overwhelmed by its fineness, low rumor, performance and content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high comfort of march and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. that incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
From the series equipment specially supersedes the rail changing assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, onboard computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and bulb tires.
In addition, for little equipment, this version featured the Premium Pack, which adds €1,500: bixenon adaptive lights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact in the category.
It highlights especially the quality of the materials used, their behavior and the high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not make a lot of kilometers a year can choose this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which ranges between 21,770 euros from the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros from the proven -Sportive- version.
In exchange for this high number, the Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars stunned more than ever wrapped in models as stylish as 'sexys' in Nine's premiere. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to watch the mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given success, the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as his American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros a month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to renounce the data when crossing the border or desperately searching for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience you need a doctoral degree in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission’s repeated earthroats to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have only had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly.
That an appliance like FonPeek (it’s no longer curious to carry the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) get this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no cakes.
It is a connected device and is paid for when buying it, not monthly.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifelong shopping option like that Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he already went to the possession of Barack Obama as U.S. president in a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - yellow green with bright reflections-, twice the clothing was composed of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same cloth-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at a first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the stellar of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestiary.
But the fabric in which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession treated a fat lace, in Oslo it is a stamped third-spear.
The complements have also varied: green half-stop shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study ‘Women's Fertility and Labour Trajectory in Spain’, prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey carried out between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workspace due to motherhood.
The study shows that there are many differences in the beginning of partnership and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the household, work part-time, or have an unstable job, initiate coexistence in couple, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting coexistence, which increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital path to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of work performed exercises a lot of influence on maternity although less on the matching schedule,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differs the age of women when marrying and having the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the older the age they marry and have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those with elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at average 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
“A division between women is also established based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actress in the international panorama, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris files, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actress Evangeline Lilly ('Perdidos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in ‘Losts’).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty x-rays of writers who have passed through his literary life (and, in cases, also on the other).
It does not in the predictable and fearful genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the creator character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not save scared or lights.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
Here I leave a few instantanees.
About Albert Camus: “In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulsion, almost physical, the same that I felt without it: pleasure against destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any gods.”
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with stunning, meaningless poetic mood, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: “Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the northern wall, from which the best alpinists are repeatedly deployed."
About William Faulkner: "He was a rare guy.
Of himself, sometimes he said he was an inheritance of a landman of the county and others who was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the delicately launched cry from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century under his literary form and made it on a journey fleeing himself and invoking the posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she stood on his knees and prayed, ‘God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spenser were engraved: 'Sleep after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life tired pleases death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
Her husband accepted normally that she told her that Eduardo VII spied her between the Azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
It has never been given the case of a man such patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pius Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but trying to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do except to remove the fame of that man to serve him as a piedestal?
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15-18-year-old young people passed alongside her and our dog, an exemplary mestize race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six pounds of weight and, without average word, they suggested two kicked the dog.
Our indignation is major because we do not find fun in a free aggression to a small, defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this one must add the focus that caused a woman who walked quietly, and who, when he insisted on these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly, or ultimately with anything weaker than himself.
The event occurred at 5 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubted that it serves much and not to generate susceptibilities, just clarify that cowards killers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to report this fact.
We don’t understand that it’s happening among young people so that they consider fun freely abusing an undefensive animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
Tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest drivers, both entities today reported.
This initiative seeks to aware the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while motorcycling.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, that “goes beyond designing and manufacturing products every day more safely” and claimed that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving the maximum diffusion.
To conclude, Michelin highlighted that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of two-wheel vehicle tyres, one of its main purposes is to develop ever-safer products.
Rise the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units enrolled in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the figures of the employer of manufacturers Anfac and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good, non-obstant, data should be placed in quarantine as the reference with which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a consequence of this, despite the last month’s return, registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold summarized all vehicles that make up the light commercial sastre drawer: car derivatives, pick-up, vans, light trucks and light chassis trucks.
Also, clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are done by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in nearly 100% of the cases through external funding.
Thus, to the restrictions of the closed bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In the face of this landscape and unlike cars, the purchase aid of the 2000E has little served.
In addition to individuals, autonomous and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer can be accommodated, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, since Ganvam, they recalled the need for the Administration to dedicate special attention to these vehicles as well as industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecast a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of cars and 4x4).
Assistance to the emergency brake is already mandatory
As it happened with ABS brake anti-blocking and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency brake aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new-enrolling light commercial vehicles and cars, while for the rest a period of deficiency is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although by their way of working it can also help avoid many collisions in reach.
The emergency brake assistant is to increase pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s footstep.
But he doesn’t always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake stepping before the collision and half of them did not take advantage of all the strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, instead, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car employs to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 mortal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four sickness with people damage would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably on day 8 – according to the U.S. manufacturer Javier Ortega warns that it will take more time to complete the Opel recovery.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has previously been agreed on by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where factories are, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, since GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to have contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aims to acquire Volvo, but forces the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, who is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab is kept by the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to develop their latest, jewelry, engineers from Porsche took the Boxster S as a base and managed to slim down nothing less than 80 pounds, which has left the scale in just 1,275 pounds.
This led them, firstly, to remove the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by one canvas with manual drive, saving 21 pounds; using aluminum doors such as GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, five more pounds were earned and assembled by 12 pounds.
Finally, resigning to the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and switching the door strippers for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with double-clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by California secondary roads, in mountain sections with truly turned traces.
Its behavior can only be called untouchable.
Weight reduction doesn’t imply that the car doesn’t trace the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, all the opposite: for a long time we didn’t test a model so small and light that, at the same time, transmitted so much safety in the passage by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and re-express his engine...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with a surgical accuracy.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is highly achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the braming of the engine, already released earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stopping or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not tough or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car diced the baches well.
Electronic aids barely made a presence act throughout the journey; and that that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and grab, or in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, of the most fun driving one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be published in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.

Basconia is given a victory in Israel
The Labor Box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous lows with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and thus sits in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which was the eight-tripled best-noted team.
The Victorian team knew to supplement the important absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
Furthermore, the great accuracy from the perimeter, with 16 triple scored, had a lot to do in the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the bluegrans, which were placed ahead from the start on the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it preach that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the leading artists from 18-20 at the end of the first party.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's interior game and Eliyahu's work, who was received with pits and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the ‘less six’ rating of Splitter had already made it preach that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being entrusted with the rest, was not decided, nor much less, and the Macabeos wanted to remind the Victorians that in their court they won no one, and with ‘the hand of Elijah’ striving they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning back to the light (50-49).
More inconveniences
The people of Ivanovic, injured but not much less dead, needed to hire a couple of matches right to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machinery, which with three near-consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a quiet income (54-67), which achieved the third-finder makeup 67 locals.
The Alaves went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and St. Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not allow anyone to remove them what had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team did not resign and tried to keep his team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Nevertheless, with Splitter eliminated by mistakes, Ivanovic's did not haste, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match had already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first in the season.
Injuries prevent battle to the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost in Greece steeply in front of the Olympiakos and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the lows of the cashmakers, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagan team was not scared by the environment of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and not by the rival’s entity, perhaps among the most powerful in Europe and with a huge budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, disappeared to the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned back to the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, fighting conate, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, suggested the disqualification of both players.
The Greek assembly began to work by showing its superiority within both areas, where the lowest injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez were launching the boxers.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian slope Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, 19 minute.
An Impossible Return
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was higher and even came to equal the difference from the match held in Malaga 66-48, Minute 27, which made the group’s leadership beat.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last down of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was almost impossible because the Olympiacs when he pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to retrieve the basket average 81-62, 37th minute, and the Unicaja went off, delivering the leadership to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the search engine with the highest number of classified real estate, employment and engine ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application leads in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feel poorly paid," Trovit product manager Albert Ribera explained in a statement.
According to the data Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros annual gross and one French, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 who receives one Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros annually net in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is the salaried job, with 11,592 euros annual net; followed by the salaried job, with 14,725 euros; and the salaried job, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are driver jobs, half-day jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil dates to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has delayed Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deputy president must abandon the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010, when officially completed his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, business officer of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" knows it must leave before that date of the embassy, where it remains refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when he finished his mandate, he has to seek another destiny.”
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy prior to the set deadline: “The position of mine is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said via telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya as a political asylum that was intended to impose the "de facto" Government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since the past spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, uncertainty again appears in the markets, which should not be surprised as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions on the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free liquidity bar to near zero rates so that financial institutions purchase assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to throw some sand into the gears how the ECB did with its auction year-on-year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are assisting a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatilities of the Stock Exchanges and the corporate bonds’ differentials have repeatedly fallen back, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels they reached in the early year.
States were forced to socialize private risks and public debt again became affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differences in the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that it arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened a new review of the lower rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty doesn't get wrong to calm up the advocates of the moral risk that were trying again to create awareness position on those responsible for global economic policy for breaking the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, Dubai’s paintings a tribal struggle between the emirates to recompose power in the emirates and Greece has already seen it before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls out of the cover.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from a breach of its foreign payments in early year and to allow a member country of the euro to breach its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials expand just like European corporate bonds we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
When our advanced indicators are forced most studies to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their rise scenarios for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, there is no much life expectancy for their warning.
Again, it has all the sound that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".

President Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of Deputies’ subcommittee in which Spain’s energy strategy is discussed in the next two decades.
Following his speech, followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa’s President Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had put forward in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50 billion by 2020 and another €60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change and it will already have to increase power.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "support energy".
Galan, who considers that the Government's Sustainable Economics Act just approved is in line with what his company has coming claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policy.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as Iberdrola President named them.
Whetherever it is, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be started to make as they already take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on land, Switzerland Swissport, will play the role of Irish airline Aer Lingus’ preferred partner for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent ones.
The agreement, from which the economic terms have not exceeded, lasts five years.
Furthermore, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centre’s work will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona punches for its first concessionary highway in Australia, a market where he already works as a power company and water manager.
The play in play is that of a tunnel valued at 1,7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to accommodate in the country as a builder and highway dealer.
The City Council wants to have it at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to take the project forward, in a business plan guarded by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to make the work and exploit the tax.
In waiting for their offerings to be presented next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros) and in the last phase three consortiums compete with remarkable presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Acciona’s team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of British Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield infrastructure manager and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where they share the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it leads to a clear difficulty of entry unless it is by the way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the cited Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, which continues to be pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has only achieved a position in that market through its 30% share in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Bets on a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, in which you already have highly presence through your activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalation.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the Adelaide desolator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground tax path, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is called to unite the western Toowong highway with the circumvalation path in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel.
The calendar marked by the Administration fixes the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last few months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two directional lanes, electronic feed system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute $500 million to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to give remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who reported yesterday the achievement of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The participated ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer quick internet access to 400,000 people and will give Germany work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still started and Hochtief has closed the sale of 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awards a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometers in length for a Slovenian highway of 64.5 million euros.
The signature achieves this contract days after making the expansion works of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The beginning of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will extend for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore agency for an approximately three million euros per year, the rail operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each Ms. Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies presented to the contest called for Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
63 million fines to France Télécom for breaking competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviors in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephone with signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting barriers to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has actually been increased because the competition-keeping authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and therefore is reinfallible.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the step of other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have earned most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the leading sources of income from big clubs.
The competition has shared 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the season 1992/93 was created, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have gone well from this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has been packed most money for participating, and the only, alongside AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list leads the Manchester United and the Munich Bayern, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the previous Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for all four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated cash-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the agency chairing Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
The UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the previous classification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only because they were there, plus another 550 000 euros for each party they were disputed.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for empattering (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eighth quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed four million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, packed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But it is that there are also variable payments, to which they are aimed at 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year champion remains with 40% of the assigned money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Romania offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Romasa group degraded the details of the purchase offer of shares with which it purchases a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public acquisition offer (OPA) for all securities.
In particular, New Romasa offers €1,5025 per share that would be paid in 10 years and that would be repayed with an interest in such 1% annual delay
Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros yesterday; therefore, New Romasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Romasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual rating of Sos.
The offer is conditioned on the designation of eight of the 15 advisors.
The jerezan group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
The payment would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructuring his address.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible purchase offers and the courts of their former managers, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the election of Maria Luisa Jorda as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman who holds a high position in the food company.
This is a new-creation position that will directly depend on the president of the group.
And it is not exempt of controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged shift of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new funding deviations
Regarding the Salazar credit, yesterday at the National Audience, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared and claimed that they approved the displacement of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the exclusion opa of Paternina submitted by Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion opa presented by Investor Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms comply with the existing rules and considering the content of the explanation brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has stated that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of Federico Paternina’s 550.008 shares at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its capital capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the completion of the offer, from which it has specified that the price has been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools to Ride Cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are trailed to a workshop, where an expert should assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and calculating the costs of parts and labour time can be a long and complicated work.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter for a few minutes.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers and then developing and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex of the American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other firms competing in the field of rating and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is a lot away from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain, working with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of which provides them with information in different formats.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed does not cease to increase, to the point that in the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies start working.
It is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and introduced its price.
In addition, each model makes a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it’s a massive windshield model, work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the circulating mobile park, it exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for the management of waste parts or to calculate the vein or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the industry.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard sinister rating solution, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which makes thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is focused on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows for pushing for vehicles declared totally sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analysis, or knowing deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop because of failures or how many have suffered serious sinisters over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to assess damage, failure or car maintenance.
The Gt Rating Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at an annual rate of 20% over the past three years, and in 2008 they charged €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, its internationalization process began, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of their business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global billing of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares are quoted for a total worth of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for sale of cars such as bikes or sinistered special vehicles.
The transaction amounted to a payout of 59.5 million euros by 85% of the society’s capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, decayers and professional vendors who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily advertisements are managed and about 100 new advertisements are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose rack number has been given down cannot be circulated again, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare part.
Cars with historic value can be high even though they have been dropped down after striking management.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the replacement, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential conditioning for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, that in a greater or less manner they are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 all-ground cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer with internet connection is required.
Once identified the model to be repaired by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables such as the labour price, recharges or discounts, and then you can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The Audatex company is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn around to see the inner face.
