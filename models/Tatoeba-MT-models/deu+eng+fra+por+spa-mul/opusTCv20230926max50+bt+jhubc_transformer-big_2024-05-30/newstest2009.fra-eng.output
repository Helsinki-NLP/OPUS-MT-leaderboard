At the end of the exchanges, the Prague exchange basculates in the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange received its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague scholarship renewed its decline from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of stocks at Wall Street.
The market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the U.S. financial sector's stabilization plan, is thus notable for us as well.
Action drops in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were successful, over the course of the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of China’s Hong Kong Stock Exchange shares lost 3.8 percent, markets being closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent, but finally we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its indice, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about rescue action in the United States will influence financial markets around the world,” says Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume the negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be likely that other countries undergo the impact of it.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (about 12 billion Kč).
Legislators thus denied the appeal to the support of President George Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a blood bath and the main share indexes experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall from such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Cede: U.S. government can inject $700 billion to banks
U.S. Congress leaders and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
He will be voted early next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion financial aid (about 12 billion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not sure.
Indeed, before publishing the final version of the law and submitting it to vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, Chairman of the Chamber’s Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee, said on Sunday.
According to sources, earlier on Wednesday, the plan should a priori be voted to the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to raise financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "disillusion" will follow.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have made a great progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions regarding the form of the package of measures to stabilize the market," Bloomberg Democratic Nancy Pelosi said.
According to her, the final vote could be made as early as Sunday.
On Saturday to Sunday night, representatives of lawmakers met U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the bottom of the government a final shape.
It should purchase from financial companies unsale real estate assets that lead financial companies to considerable losses and threaten system stability in its entirety.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
“We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Exchanges
The global financial crisis has significant impacts on the declining stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators have made the Congress a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They therefore wish to calm investors before the beginning of trading on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress’s decision could influence Monday’s trade.
It is now impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations are not at risk of remaining blocked at the last moment by such a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still have many changes.
The total amount intended for the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first $100 billion additional, then, to the end, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the President can put his veto to this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finances for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value has been cut, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“The whole work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George Bush himself is happy with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush was happy with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the degree agreement, the development of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee, which will ensure the oversight of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides aid for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new deposits in the case of hypothecas that it will purchase, while reducing the monthly payments of the debtors and allowing the debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: A Psychological Aid
According to Chief Economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that we don’t know what the mechanism and price will be to buy trouble assets.
This point will be decisive to address the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” said Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or in the beginning of the next week, Marek says it is not so important.
“It’s much more important than Congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," said Marek.
An extreme fight: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
There are sufficient reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap high-end grammophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But if there are vinyl records in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you’re probably dreaming of such a grammophone.
The same is the same for music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say simplifiedly - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way as a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble to support the headphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and films, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, be used to navigate.
And if you take into account smartphones and communications, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Because no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television takes photographs, we almost watch a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And playing music is one of the most important energy flows.
There are rare mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this number is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (specially the most rudimentary) are significantly more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, consider that they will only play music for a few hours.
In addition, if you sometimes call from time to time, get a second recharge for work - this is valid even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able to, as a result of a recharge, continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially because not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Obviously, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take it without reduction, being given the small dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
With regard to the readers, you do not need any software, except for the exception (iPod).
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library ranked by the interpreter’s name, the title of the album, style, or the user’s judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a shaft structure, as Windows Explore, others are capable of both (irriting, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, be particularly interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of output of the sound and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and in the day you will hear that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you’ll just have any mobile reading the MP3s.
Almost all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone can play the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will just have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or other provider) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to purchase a musical mobile.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to quickly made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in boxes, which possess virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you can have a very suitable walkman already.
In most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and best tools, also provided with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone can control the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily match the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a grammophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by an immense data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive are out of it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding auditors, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent MP3 control keys, so the command comfort is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in Czech is relatively advanced, our operators offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still miss something - a virtual operator, which would force classical operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Agency (Czech Telecommunications Agency), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed.
This is how, following the last steps of the European Commission in roaming fees regulation, a paradoxal situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really wish to enter the fight.
This may seem paradox, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that greatly exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Board (Czech Telecommunications Board), who repeatedly stated that there was no room for another operator in Czech Republic, chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network apparently has no more luck (moreover, he would now find only frequencies hardly).
There is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market that resulted in a significant decrease in prices, which then also had to respond to conventional operators.
However, even before the entry of events such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were left to hear in Britain.
But it appeared that there was a place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We don’t have to go too far to find examples.
In February, we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only six months, this operator managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which, among other things, has the U:phone in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to make their operation effective, they indeed need much less customers than a conventional operator.
Indeed, they are exempt from the construction, operating and maintenance costs of the mobile network, relatively high.
This is how virtual operators in the world are profiling themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers at least twice cheaper SMS in Britain than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertising shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“The real men choose Mobilking – an operator who likes them and whom they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home as well.
Vodafone’s spokesman Miroslav Čepický, in doubt: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially because it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offering of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czech, negotiations are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area,” said Jana Studničková, spokesman of the Penta Financial Group, in a phone host for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic were, in any case, not favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for long enough.
“We want a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the earlier it will be the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl Group spokesman.
The future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At this moment, we do not estimate there is place in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us,” said Vlastimil Sršeň, the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she added, "It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate within such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone rather directs his attention to the fulfillment of requests to obtain his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe mean most contributions from the customers' perspective.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
What is then good to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand themselves like thefts in fair. The chicane accompanied by the creation of the U:phone also testify to it.
The most apparent pressure on the ČTU, when the U:fon was created, was the pressure exercised by the T-Mobile company.
This provides evidence of information accessible to the public from the Internet pages of the CTU.
Now, the U:phone is promised to serve as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: “Competition in the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would submit it, and above all its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulatory agencies seems confusing.
However, it is not only about the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has not the power to intervene in economic competition in Czech Republic.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
Now, the latter adopted, in the face of this issue, its typical position.
“The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible as a result of the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders a priori has not presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," Kristián Chalupa, the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations, said in response to our question.
A statement made therefore would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care, so that no one benefits from its position in the market, such a statement is more than disturbing.
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be found that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile phone services.”
However, pressure in the direction of an honest market functioning and a decrease in prices apparently does not be part of the OHSU's interests.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which comes from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a chance, is naturally asked.
Similarly, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the random and hard competition fight.
"The office has not noted signs of an anti-competitive behaviour in this matter, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour in the market.
The tools needed for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to lack even the telecom regulator,” said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discord.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the ČTU, according to which telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition, constitute a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some law experts propose another vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, you must obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least concerning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are visiblely performing in a similar manner.
However, complaints of many interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Retaining responsibility for the CTU is a fairly common tour in communications, through which the UOHS wash the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the newly adopted Telecommunications Act has not been introduced to an expansion of the powers of ČTU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised improvement in the situation.
This must be known very well by the UOHS representatives, but their interests are apparently different.
When no one looks, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price list of mobile phone services, but they are public only partly.
In most cases, it’s about multi-level marketing firms.
Specialized mobile phone services are thus offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected people.
The tour of magic consists of the fact that the company makes in front of the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbid such a resell.
"If what you talk about happened, it might be a breach of the contractual conditions we would examine and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the society in question," Martina Kemrová said.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the responsible of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
Any operator, however, does not decide against such a proceedings.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them unforgettable profits, and at the same time, in contrast to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, these are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded under their name, so they cannot fully arrange it, as the ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But this is precisely what should seem strange in the CTU.
Furthermore, another question is asked at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the UOHS has relatively wide powers to be able to disclose such a activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned repeatedly, the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has resulted in a significant decrease in service prices.
Now, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were sometimes more, sometimes less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But precisely at that level, in developed countries, the regulatory agencies have been involved, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measurements and by informal pressure, they finally obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the manner of a hot potato that we get rid of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
Because of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in the skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the sleeve after the crack.
If the scenario information says true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to create a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will hardly remain impassible in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new records of the national hymn Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was once again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care of that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that one can understand the words that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national hymn will celebrate its 175th birthday next year.
The song Kde domov můj sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka, Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriate it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first coupling became naturally an integral part of the national hymn.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Pragous public transport (MHD) will introduce chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragosian Transport Agency) will be entered as the date when the first passengers will climb to the subway, trams and bus, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and record it on their chip map at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the stations Muzeum, Můkastek, Ludrý and Rošovice
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the internet coupons on the Dopravní podnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can forget definitively the tickets in the subway stations, where they so far had to catch up with long tails in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon on the internet and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the 13 Městská knihovna (Municipal Libraries).
“In these points of contact, there is available to the passengers a checkout with trained staff, which will help those interested in purchasing via the internet and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their map,” says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will also be recorded on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several subway stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the ticket composting machines and the passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five of them, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety of them," Opatrný added.
An automat will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that are going to work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
In other words, in periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of Central Bohemian municipalities mainly use to access the capital.
"In trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava, controllers are equipped with card readers, with the aid of which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons," explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets from the Ropid organization, which designs the timetables of the common transportation.
The periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When embarking it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver,” Dr. Drapal said.
Passengers who do not take periurban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetes call for a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the Sudetes asked in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patron of the United States of America.
In 1945, some German groups of Sudetes allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This results among others from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov prayed in the letter the US president not to allow "Šumavská župa" - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have well understood the situation and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the US troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed, is written, “Nobody, to whom the fate of Šumava is at heart.”
Because the rallying with Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without respect, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter pray the U.S. President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has nothing contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of the million of the inhabitants,” he wrote.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire to revenge the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would, according to the authors of the letter, only have to organize a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the US employer.
Although the text contained in the letter, given the current knowledge of post-war history, may seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudetes Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least interview that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as the German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the Englishmen and placed in the Holstein region's capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult with him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be profitable to them," Chalupa said.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he believed, that after the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that is intended to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s office believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous behavior on the wheel.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It mostly wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, not forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidence of the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in majuscules on the registration plate.
Then, in a flaw of blood, there is the phrase "You Pay".
What must symbolize that one can pay life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hanter" spectators until 2010.
The department has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be commonly seen with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
“What works with the drivers is the system of sugar and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers,” says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertisements, the psychologist estimates.
The signs signaling the danger to drivers are, he says, already less effective.
“When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it,” Korán said.
Olmert would make almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favour of the restitution of almost all territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, even all,” Olmert said on a daily basis.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that peace will not be done,” he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wishes security in Jerusalem, and especially, does not wish tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as one of my best friends happened, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places” located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he subsequently stressed.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retirement from the Golan heights, which he believed is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relationships with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in precise Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency coach near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the coach during the journey.
“If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation.
The accident, during which a 22-year-old host died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the path to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident or even brake suddenly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical datasheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing seat equipment is not approved, the passengers must stay sitting.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; which was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the company director Radim Jančura.
“This is a question we dealt with with the department and, at first, it prohibits passenger movement.
Then they cancelled it and we obtained that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription takes care of this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription also prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road transport law knows only the term vehicle recipient; it does not define its rights and duties," adds spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals with the issue sufficiently.
“All depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
Everything is there," he said.
Buses are divided into urbans, where there are standing seats and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and higher permitted speed and long-distance-free standing buses with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, an expert says
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) safety in transportation, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"When regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Not there, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the host of the air can hit his head."
“Or, in the case that the bus would have suddenly braken, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the law point of view, the issue is not settled.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job as a risky job.
“Only as soon as I feel it’s a risky job, I’ll remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspapers on board.
This would also decrease the costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason that gives the lack of stewards in his vehicles the director of Asiana Alexey Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any hosts. We're opposed to it since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end with a deadly accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess in the Plzeň region, who has been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably removed the emergency stop strip without using a flashing and blocked the road by the bus.
The driver trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he broke it off by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company aims to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relys on the guilty.
A change to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the law, which has been developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts in the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movement of stewards on the bus.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in buses, but rather in point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the cell phone on the wheel,” says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as one thing that would fundamentally endanger passenger safety," spokesman Hanzelka concludes, specifying that the control of bus safety is under the power of police and office for work safety.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfians are based on Frankfurt.
The great words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the house employees.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be constituted, according to the letter released Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
Such a relationship could be the decisive sending towards other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a directoral committee wants to demonstrate its ability to action in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, always undergoes strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Authority for Financial Services Monitoring which, only recently, clearly made the Government of the Northern Rhine-Westfalia Land clear that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been concerned for some time – also on the Frankfurt side – of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Certainly, chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas told during the presentation of the figures of the late August semester that he saw no meaning in the fusion of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings boxes groups, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks have only started, however, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, has one of the biggest employers on Frankfurt’s financial square, entered into play as it is about consolidating the savings cash sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland Land Bank Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing has come out of this territory bouquet.
Only the plans had been made public that the country government of Hesse pronounced against all Hellaba's participation in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join each other either.
The Bank of the Rhineland Land Palatinat was attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new talks about the grouping of Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had spoken against any merging business strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the aggregation of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election in the country parliament of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the country bank of Bavaria-Wuttenberg could first be realized.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that requires new mergers should increase, potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far better resisted the crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thingure savings and transfers grouping, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba capital, on the other hand, pushed a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB would remain in rigor.
Such geostrategic reflections, however, only reflect one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match themselves.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, thanks to what commercial model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be secured, had not been solved by the German savings and transfers group.
In the end, a WestLb division could take place, division which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what it refers to in the letter of the Executive Committee in place: in any case, a "complete solution" for the establishment would be targeted.
How all this will be placed in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, near a tone of five liters of beer by the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party which deep sounds his goat can produce.
Elena takes Luca first, then kiss her.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the new Puorta train station, four bus take departure tonight at 23.45 p.m., `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled to arrive at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved above all for the Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively to Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking, the South Americans are singing then and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat doubled with false fur and glasses with wide silver mounts.
For five years, they have gone to the beer party, already three turned just this year.
They go there at night, stay at the party, and come back at 22:30.
And spending the night would involve unnecessary fees, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco has taken a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses already drive at night on the Autostrada direction ‘Brennero’.
There's no beer yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strengths.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates will once again take a break before Munich, on the 8th highway.
When in the morning, Marco’s group finally arrived at six o’clock thirty as planned on the parking near Teresa Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, the attack plan explains.
First: Hair up with the little yellow cap.
Below is written to the left ‘Beer Party’, in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco’s travel agency ‘conoscersiviaggiando.it’.
Secondly, “When the doors of the beer cap open, we’re running,” Marco screamed in the morning.
‘Course!’ Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Not ahead, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow headsets on the same benches, they must be distributed in the room!”
The shope, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
“Show to security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: ‘This evening, I’ve come back here at ten and a half hours!’
And this is, we went to the beer party.
Along the way, somebody novels the yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the panels and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the ‘week-end of the Italians’.
There are no specific figures; we talk about 50,000 who walk through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The Municipality Police is strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which performs a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Nights of insomnia for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word “relatively” and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside DAX, obtains a consortium of German banks a billion credit to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are granted up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate is now expected to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa-daughter company that supports the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financer had refinanced itself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since mistrust towards markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the clean equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, to zero, the profits from the allocation of determined debts and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only due to the significant profits from the refund of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Defa Group, as well as the refund of interest in the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the gain deficit of approximately 16 percent has proven to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer had first poorly speculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been subsidiated to the Aareal bank.
Because conventional state funding was not sufficiently cost-effective, Defa had then more intensely engaged in infrastructure projects and shared project funding between private investors and state (PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out deductions that should have on the calculation of the group’s gains and losses a vital material effect that still remains fairly flawless.
The fact is that dividend has been amputated.
By 2007, they had been shortened to two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been, since the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the interbanking market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the credit allocation between banks has once again became significantly tari, the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a party - approximately 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credits of a short-term medium of refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets widely outside currently.
Other sources say refinancing would be guaranteed through the funds until the end of 2009.
Chairman of HRE’s Executive Committee Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Monitoring (Bafin) come from the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now guaranteed.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have only to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be resorted throughout its scope.
But the opposite cannot be deleted either.
After the fact that the bank, according to the latest statements, is still at the doors of insolvency Sunday late evening, this at least provisional rescue will not be able to reassure the minds either.
The action price dropped from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The costs of obligations, however, are particularly good.
While the first chief's debts have barely moved, the second-plan loan rates are slowing down.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter Württemberg Hypo and of course those who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that entered the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the bank Depfa.
As long as emission institutions, governments and less affected trade banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to assume a resorption in time.
Or will happen what no one dares to hope right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached certainty today has become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights above all to long-term creditors on whether they have to separate their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn on to defer losses for the next few years on the next automatically taken capital income tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to attend for the first day at Tachibana High School, girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
“The first day of course in Japan.
What was I excited.
Already the way to school was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t lose myself.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in Lower Saxony.
Students appear each after each other from eight hours, until at nine o'clock less than twenty, a table round begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was my own to present myself.
I am not the kind of to love to talk before people, especially before a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have the uniform of the school yet, I put an old skirt of my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue up socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself in front of the pupitre, and tried to pronounce everything properly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to start learning language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have all made low masses, laughed and signed, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him already thanks to my sleeves.
It belongs to the indispensable vocabulary for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cute."
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone talked to whom better, saved laughing and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English.
During the break, they all came out of their Bento.
My host mother had also done this kind of lunchbox to me - it's really something else than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber salad and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is sure is that everything is really good.
Okay, except perhaps the salted prunes, brrrr!
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and that is then especially carefully prepared - in the hope of making a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could watch it here too.
"Why in particular Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
Ultimately, reading mangas is what I’ve preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
To me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak one for traditions, us and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
The rats also have sensations.
A rat or cock leaking from the danger, is that mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think you are true without having the proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else have so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or generally consciousness, we enter into hardly practicable grounds because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat stands in front of a danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes the dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave in the same way, so some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our lives subjective to that of animals difficult.
One of the aspects is that circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal side cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least therefore, for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence is linked to language, often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is as difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not let us measure or, due to this particular Hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems to us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness next to me that should be easier to be scientifically accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be considered without taking into account their contents, and that’s exactly what happened during short-term studies on primate memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens with emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its sequences, such as the body’s reactions) grabs the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and particularly humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of Cortex and brain trunk, just like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
Because this network did not change much during human evolution, it could entirely participate in transverse sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that cannot be demonstrated.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could we check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in the same way?
A cow runs out of danger, but if he feels fear?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cows, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the cause of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for man, how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cows (who knows?) have sensations.
But I couldn't know how to demonstrate it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is nervous as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Because I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It could be judged as short-term, but I rather move forward rather than constantly hitting on a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional one.
UEFA President Platini: A Grace Delay for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championships in collaboration with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The job just started, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the calendar of building or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League, Grigorij Surkis.
“The UEFA is constantly in the eyes of us.”
Even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There would be a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act under the rules,” Drzewiecki, Polish news agency PAP, said.
"We assured in a letter to the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted in the previous season for mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League has even been decayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignated counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - with the view and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis was infidel to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relationships for his new film "The Women" - there is told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as infidel husband fell clearly: it would be “Monstruous,” he said at the New York Daily News, 54 years old, that “Meg again remakes the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be more "regretable" that "the pain and disruptions that a divorce for each child will be re-reinforced in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
So was his answer to the claw: “Anyhow, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that goes best.”
Prices of plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial service and travel provider.
The company analyzed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after a price rise in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After hotels market prices have risen for years, hotels nights have already reduced to many places.
From January to March, prices increased by 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities still reviewed compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear above all in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "declining envious of American tourists travel."
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in hotels prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotels prices stand with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
Due to the rising price of kerosene, economic class passengers have to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-term flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economic class ticket prices dropped on average by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even greater than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price drop would be, on the one hand, slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand would lead ground in a lot of segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the "Open Ciel" treaty that liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal of non-revenue airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find an eleven functional.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Catastrophe landing for international player Marko Marin.
The player of Gladbach only returned late in the game and his shooting lifted failed against the framework of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffled Hermann Rieger in the Hall of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was happening in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most had relieved in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he has a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Where orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice was missing.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suggested to be more relaxed too."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle of time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
“It was a dirty victory,” Marin Jol summarizes.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121 years of age on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional rating paintings on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubted that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-engaged arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric goalkeeper just like Jansen dismissed from FC Bayern - is definitely formed gently, but it doesn't shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones came a little bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market index was 10,579 points with a decline of five percent.

The most losing Dow Jones were on that date American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could no longer bring profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs’ shares accused a decline of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called ruined mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid once, but gradually.
In contrast, the State should retrieve options on the shares of the financial society that can be exchanged correlatively with the changes of the course in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.
The prices of shares in the turbine in Europe and the United States

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe has flyed into space.
Due to soon frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been caused by disaster among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain an additional boost in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what researchers have been surprising for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of how it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Much more, irregularities appear at speed level.
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study always believes hard as iron that Einstein was not misleading and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter might be responsible for this anomalie, matter that is also near Earth,” he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had required a redemption of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be launched.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WORLD ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visiblely free.
This is what Egyptian state television, Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media have announced in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages were released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian accompaniers are safe and well done, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on the way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting prior to the release of the hostages still remain flawless: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to terminating the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without screaming railway station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
It was only left to collect the hostages, when suddenly “this surprise” occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six kidnappers in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and arrested two of them.
Hostages had required Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom payment.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe road to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law that led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by his stepmother led a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, in the Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges for indecent facts.
Truro's high-instance court said he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, between 5 and 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Miss Randle, 34, was suicided at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and tied her before forced her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, an assistant volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfing and cyclist, has appeared to be "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
They think she's suicided by suffocking with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who had, on the other hand, written a letter of confession that ended like this: "I bound him and banded him regularly."
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of seven.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And the most amazing thing is that if she had not made this gesture, her story would certainly never be finished in court.”
He added: "I highlight in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Condemnation for the loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, according to the BBC.
The Department of Defense man was on the journey when he forgot two highly ranked documents, on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be under the guardian of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments on Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies faced with the invoice B&B.
British building companies may have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savings from Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money of savings, including 59 building companies.
Director-General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it’s “irriting” that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages will be released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that the institutions that have had cautious behavior... now have to pay some of the institutions' bills that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a amount proportional to the deposits it owns, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will need to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Company Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair.
It's "irritant" to see that institutions who have had cautious behavior during the recovery of the real estate market now need to pay for the much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, dating the first annuals.
“We have to consider all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to avoid building companies and their members paying this salt invoice,” Cole said.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, we will have to pay the interest of the whole year, which could also double.
Given that building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members finally pay the invoice either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny in liter
Jersey people need to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced she would increase the wholesale price of her milk from five penny to liter from Monday.
This is the second increase in price that follows a two-penny increase in February, and occurs as a result of a research conducted by a consultation company.
Retailers must decide whether they are going in turn, raising the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varying for the last time, in 2002.
Ex-Pm of Bangladesh refused caution
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request for caution to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who thus risks being arrested upon his return to the country.
His attorneys said the court refused to give her his caution because of her examination for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations that are addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s ever-rival, has been relaxed under caution earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country’s provisional military government first gives him its entire freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they don't see why she could remain free when she returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require a guarantee since she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," she said in a statement.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this guarantee to return to the country to prepare the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took over power, but was released in June to cure herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations they are subjected.
Anxiety for the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent immunization campaign against polio, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the UN carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she failed to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite Taliban’s promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV Justice Battle
BSkyB lost his trial following the decision of the Competition Commission, which would force him to reduce his participation in his rival ITV transmitter.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The committee said that in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB, shares of ITV, somed doubt on the effective independence of ITV, therefore inciting the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB said that forced her to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of US prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is from political causes.
Special accusator Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accusator able to force witnesses to file was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute begins with the radiation of nine US prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of the Congress, while others would have refused to investigate charges of fraudulent vote against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
Head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice have also given their resignation.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, declaring that he considered him "the first responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abdicate" his role as a leader," remarkably successful not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush’s former employee Karl Rove, were critical for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epope must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf has to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic singing Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the award is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly goes away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranking fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf or Marvin Lee Aday, of his true name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong Laryngite forced her to cancel concerts.
Then he found a cyst in the voice ropes.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may be for sale soon.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street – not to confuse with Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide for 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty walk rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers, however.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to stores and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, have stated to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the housekeeping.
But the City's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development which manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to stay in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, local manager of the committee No.3.
“There are only few spaces left belonging to the city, and we would wish that the city retains Extra Place,” she said.
“They might propose to re-estate it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we wish to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn’t necessarily mean she wants to be the owner of it.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relocate this abandoned walk, and make it public," she said, emphasizing that it was the city to suggest the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spoken door of the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wishes to well sell the street, further emphasizing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving on the side this small piece of earth, which has since been abandoned.
The post-entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of rods, barrels, barrels, posters, leaves and cords.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarety—a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fell in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look on A City in the Extinction Process"), relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow bag ass, dark of day and night, and delimited by the doors of a roast iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers of last week flying along the gouttiers."
With a few exceptions, the street always has the same look.
A rat runs agilely at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and now became the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 ounces beer empty, rests on the side of newspapers that have just been thrown.
Some passengers said they rarely think at Extra Place, and suggested their development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “they are happening in dark, wet and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Educational Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates about bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of California studies, and former director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy department of education, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you didn't think. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign highlights that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program in particular supports among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question asked for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends education in language classes other than English, in addition to his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students from this school are largely Spanish, and low income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 math state exam, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students passed the English-Language-Art Exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analytics, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, Sixth Street lead, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total English-language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you wouldn't have had any chance to identify him."
“This works,” she observes, “it works for us.”
Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools composed mostly of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he is favorable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all have to stop challenging the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he said, “You have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wishes to eliminate the differences, he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than denial them or consider them as insignificant.
Nice oil drop following the new concerns of the world of economy
Oil prices dropped significantly Monday because people fear that the rescue plan for financial steps would be successful to bring back life to the economy.
Raw oil transactions decreased by 7% to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, during the sales of this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 in barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, raw material markets have been shaken by the financial agitation of Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having seen in July, an increase of $145.29 in barrel, prices dropped to nearly $90 in barrel this month, before rebouncing in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the rescue agreement, the biggest in history, concluded this week by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be durable.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalized the European Financial Conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said that this week’s frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, appear to have failed to revive the market.”
While the economic situation is deteriorating, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The prospective global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
“We think raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
As for raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread overall and in particular in China.
The bank’s analysts reduced their expectations for next year, given oil consumption drops due to slow economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Determining Second Time Feast for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals were sally played under obscure clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded in making a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12 yards touchdown, a precursor sign of one afternoon during which their relationship went forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from half-time.
"I didn't leave my area," Favre said about all his passports to Coles.
"He's a poor player"
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat the quarter back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shoot and fit 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ball fleeing because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yards goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a time.
"Jet coach Eric Mangini, whom we asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third time?"
When told him the two Jets left 21 unquestionable points in the third time- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of a compelling race on the dish, Gebrselassie beat her record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his beautiful career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing-- may be exaggerated in today's eyes,- that air pollution doesn't increase its problems with asthma.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees starting, 55 at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track riders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background riders, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffering from soft cramps two weeks before, and missing training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not roasted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused, especially in Kenya, the rival is African from Ethiopia to have too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the lips as if they were in a track competition, and considering more global records than the meaning of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s capabilities as a background runner.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04 on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the heads were missing.
A little more than three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made her final rise to get rid of Kwambai, which ends second at 2:05:36, improving her best personal five-minute record.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, ended a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She couldn’t participate in Beijing games because of a bad back hypothetic, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of nearly five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a beautiful advantage, then exceeding about 1⁄2 miles afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ends third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, is a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood house, this description it made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make today." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city it describes has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her real thoughts with the white man, who “we know so little, doesn’t know what he loses.”
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of the race, many here remain cautious of the abroad's eyes.
“We are very cautious about how to tell history,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has always been the oldest parish in the city.
“It must be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black power gain and a community of nearly 2,400 people where poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of Southern black rural culture – sometimes denied, sometimes acclaimed – which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her native city to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which results in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Boldly like a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the ownership store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
“Along the road on the left,” she writes, “you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds which Howard Miller has always cared for, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can serve passengers.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a government car but also with analphabetization, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn’t like that.
It was actually not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora has well described the reality," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s girls that Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty.
She added, “Some people didn’t appreciate it.”
Hurston is always remembered as a living and excentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were laughing at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he also adds, sparkling in his chair at the back of the patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long."
After Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College of the 1920s, she was buried in any tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration or plate for the general public.
I don’t think they have understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to move a five-way highway in town, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way community street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west angle of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mixing of breeds led to hatred at the community doors.
“At that time, a band of white young people came to throw oranges or objects against people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They launched a pastry from their car.”
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorious of my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
“The black children were used to be kissed—I remember it well—we kissed our master in the morning, and evening as well,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and Chief Executive Officer of the Eatonville Community Safeguard, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with joyful own trust and conduct lines such as: "How can they deprive my company's pleasure?"
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker travelled to the anonymous grave of Hurston and began struggling to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston directed by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project came just at the time when the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attractiveness.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this road would cause.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
“The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, real civil pride,” said Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summarized the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has attended our church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (obviously referred to as Hurston) opens in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomalie for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself as a back street on a summer rain day, as little as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today we count 90 percent of blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason to be, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be requested for most interviews, and some things—such as the walls of the Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a brave teacher who has a weak for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerges.
The young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his whole race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossing, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is very sincere civic affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, such as Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description properly.
"Most people, who go through this area there, will think: 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,'" Alondra Kenon said after the Mass Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is commonly speaking financial.
Nonetheless, nothing has changed.
If Manhattan tourists stand away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in glass and bee nest offices above their ties, bankers and cover fund managers who monopolise New York spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The handlers continue to walk on the roads, with their wagons and muffin plates for morning meetings.
The Latinos are still dragging between residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke disposed on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make their tail to buy their morning sandwich from ambulant merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 6am and 7pm in the week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the entirely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Thankfully I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I found out at my local affiliate of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people taking the tail.
Not in front of the checkouts of the cashmakers, nor to remove the cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service checkout, where usual customers command their checkers, tourists asked the direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those ahead of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal bank," all did the tail for the same reason as I.
Not in the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have removed their money from the so-called thrift savings accounts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings boxes and their subsidiaries that only operate in a state, and that say treat customers as their family.
In the past, 15 of these banks have fallen in bankruptcy.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a 327-dollar capital bank, used the bankruptcy trade union, and as the New Yorkers returned home for the end of the week Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, saving $440 million accounts, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the bank that makes the most rescue in Wall Street.
New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket talking to the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that bankrot, and her lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the monetary funds market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take a risk.”
Profanate Muslim tombs as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They wear road panels illustrating mosques scratched in red.
The police accuse extremists of extreme right for profaning a Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of extreme right political parties in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun’s cemetery near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
Criminals have painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as David’s Star; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of extremists’ hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow related to the elections.
A speech gate by the Islamic Local Community said it was "deeply shocked" to the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touchs its end.
Austria seriously thinks of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that rafted nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the wearing of the slope and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference because they were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is prohibited from traveling abroad.
The courts prohibited the glamour rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of child, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed Glitter a six-month ban, after he expressed his intention to go to Spain through France.
The police in Kent gave this ban on traveling last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter’s guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or by his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Limited Courts, but was still represented by his attorney Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "Thursday, September 25, in the court of Ashford, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before planned departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could purge a sentence for up to five years of detention.
Kent’s police said it would not discuss particular cases or potential Glitter’s movements in the county.
A spokesperson from Kent Police said, "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as those from abroad.
“It’s easier to monitor someone remaining in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more efficiently.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intent for the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region to minimize the potential risks for the public."
. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after purging 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10-year-old and 11-year-old girls respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he had to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel good, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and at the end he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him to enter their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted on him to return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 Aug and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Limited Court of Court, West London, to register him on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been purged a four-month penalty in the United Kingdom for detention of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Interior said Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter was prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care about moving on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stage performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the schedule of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, larger every day," explains the creator, which clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to convey on stage of passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture the moments of personality of these artists, you don’t have to take photos on the stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the "Popular Mines Chant" festival, Bauer began a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and equipment, remember the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylish means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for the essential and magic has been the constant of this work presented these days at the El Fotómata Gallery.
Flamenco seedles such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You are in front of people, characters you sometimes don’t know, or who leave you just a few minutes to be able to make a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas reality.”
This collection of portraits of the present flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at the number 20 of rue de la Mata (rue parallel to the Hercule People) which will be opened until October 16th next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is “true bold”
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown topics, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he works on, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it is "a true boldness" and that "everything demonstrates that it should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts, which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people walking through the aqueduct city.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by the majority of the participants’ voices, made a full room at the theatre Juan Bravo.
The presentator of the Festival, Felix Romeo, has faced a fascinated audience who has not seen the time spent during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humour, have recalled the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live a very new experience";
The Hispanic-American novel acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change their lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "leads people less similar to go," because it was asked to go.
Bad weather destroys Pozoblanco fair
The festivity of the banderols that concluded the bull races of Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreadors checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizational committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was hard on this fair, as two out of three parties were finally unable to take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have met in the arena of Castilblanco.
Only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the even afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderels planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradins applaud more than his fight with the bull in itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his struggle with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was smitten by most of the audience.
Police control of a truck in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five o'clock less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a truck and the two latter start the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachish, which stops them.
Police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to the information disclosed by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting documents.
The incident occurred when various Alava Traffic Unit officials conducted vehicle control over the N-1, at the border of the Commune of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began pursuing them until the vehicle stopped two miles further on the lower coast, where the two occupants went down to escape into a wooded area.
Basque police have finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachish votes, and then they transferred it to a police station for a comprehensive inspection and weighing the drug.
Furthermore, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, and that is why they also attributed the detainee to a document falsification offence.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., was warned to carry out the different steps and will be judged within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange manoeuvres trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman of California police patrol unveiled to the magazine People.
The witness said that around 6:30 p.m., Locklear "focused on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who initially had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left her vehicle.
That person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why agents took her to the drug and alcohol specialist center to conduct a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was dismissed from the beginning, although “according to the observation of police officers at first glance, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug.”
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 19.00 a.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was internized to cure herself from nerve depression.
Llamazares requested the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out favour treatments to his family members.
“In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take over its responsibilities,” Llamazares said in a statement regarding the political party’s behavior that it will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the United Left leader asked the investigations to show “transparency” for the irregularities Silva could have committed: “The United Left has always defended such affairs so that they have a maximum degree of transparency.”
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all officials.”
“Blood of Mayo,” Garci’s daring bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’ stories, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Battle of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his film with nearly 15 million euros budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novel, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, Sangre de Mayo, will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
The great admirer of Galdós’ literature, José Luis Garci, assures that he had accomplished with this shooting “a dream of child” thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who tried him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was held to the national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid constitute Garci a “one-of-the-art opportunity” to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of a Spain that has misleaded as a leader in the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebels under the reign of Ferdinand VII.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films, Captain Alatrist or The Ghosts of Goya – more than twice that obtained for Blood of Mayo – because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he collaborated almost throughout his career.
The filmmaker has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before starting the shooting and whom he doesn’t cast, since it seems “humiliating” and considers that “the role of the filmmaker is to go to theatre and cinema to keep informed.”
Many actors in "Blood of Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, Blood of Mayo, Seven French Billard Tables, and finally the winner, Blind Sunflowers, are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie, Garci does not expect a prize.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the offspring, then you realize that you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re just making an additional film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón sets in the skin of dancer Sévillane Tórtola Valencia
A Sevilla dancer will pay tribute to a Sevilla dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an eastern dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of the release of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the dance history in Europe of the two-wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this latter offered me to interpret the dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed amazing to me.”
According to the dancer, “We are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
The title of his dances made me remind of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me remind of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
His dance was sensitive and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as his,” she said.
The stage was done with two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda’s, who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done to “The Open Gate”; and Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actors, Juanfra Juárez, who played the role of a companion.
This work also tells, in some ways, the life of this woman who has been exhibited in such a distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember it because I think it’s those women who have a huge influence in their times and now no one knows and emphasizes their work,” says Bayon.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennate
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in the St. Stephen's church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Nobel Prize Ministry of Culture of Andalusia and their anniversary to celebrate the "Zenobia Triennate" and Juan Ramón-com-2006
In this way, the "Zenobia Triennale and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerating exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This village of light" which was inaugurated in the last month of May and after traveling to the various provinces of Congress in New York.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most well-known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was a part of it.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Evil", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the stunning idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He was hard to get an Oscar.
It has not been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This was a hard shot for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels beyond any expression, and now I lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of getting ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the Americans’ estimation fell well down, desperately seeking motives for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there remains only to human beings admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elderly following overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that has been troubled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration scattered Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy coming from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put us the high bar,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to drill the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities were not missing to be.
“But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a bifteck in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that isn’t so usual in America.
“Among all the great roles he interpreted, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and philanthropy,” he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I’ve ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an eliminatory note.
Let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with the removal of the backshorts, which forces you to go there in advance.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the backbone (first mistake, moving only for that) and (after a long row waiting) surprise!, there was only the size 'S ' for the suit (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy than smaller shirts with less fabric and then cheaper?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the races.
Besides the fact that you need to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting thread is 15 minutes and, moreover, you need to leave your backpack at the entrance.
Waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Because there was a long row of waiting, the competitions began and we hadn't left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebels and barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of perfect race, this would not be the idea of me.
Thus, I think we will always be able to dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the Microsoft MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the company’s campus) in response to what was asked for.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remember what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups.
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and is not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer her in a few moments.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly emphasized that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It takes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are increasingly getting less attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
The computer is only turned on to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less complex, less complex months.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I will show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of Microsoft’s employees’ resting rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees were using Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009, but to the end of 2009 or seeing in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since Android’s launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensively.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endossed him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Patron' and is part of the dressing of the association of muscle gays.
And if we begin to list all its appearances, we could also mention this mustachu coward that raised weight in an ambulant circus.
It's not just a masculine body shirt in cotton, moulding and sleeves-free.
The English calls it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is distinguished among all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - who has to do with the sport as he takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel' distinguishes from others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that the most known body suits have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand produces not only top tanks.
But she also produces sweatshirt, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me."
His huge resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, sisters Cruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present in the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also in the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I even created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we inspire ourselves a lot for our collections.
I really like to walk in town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and actress, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but ultimately everything joins and these activities have a lot of things in common.
Since I was very little I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
The dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you support the clothes it is at that moment that you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
Suddenly, everything is connected.
Have you been 30 years ago: Was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my thirty years rejoice.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I’ve been little and that gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think you're becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's come to the cinema, you're waiting for the different films you've filmed last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them.
As I am a woman out of theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course that is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the movies ‘The Last Minute’ and ‘In search of the tomb of Christ’.
To see what you're going to think about it...
You started on the gateway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, right?
Don't say that!
I didn't go on the gateway to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for a lot of time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity parade for her association in support of women and clothes we exhibit - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold on auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a soft-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things aren’t true.
And that good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to scroll for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pearl, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recipients of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcoholic' system
The Interior Minister wants that the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol has to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in drunk or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its goal is to reincorporate the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for Road Safety and also the Directorate-General of Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for Auto Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in drunken condition, the car resumes.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a vehicle-on-line system that measures the alcohol rate in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the driver's authorized.
Its cost is greater than 1,000 euros and is at the charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
This measure is due only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be made by ordinary paths, but the reform made by criminal paths, however, requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one experimentally.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 7:40 a.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landing in the presidential hangar of Mexico’s Benito Juárez airport.
The sun was before sunset, but its rays still forced to put their hands as a visier so that they could see the royal couple descending from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, well, we can't go to the airport to take guests at this time... Are you here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm a Spanish but I've lived here thinking about two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row composed of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair at the wind, is very soberly dressed and doesn’t wear her usual ‘peep-toes’; perhaps they had told her a storm threatened.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going into the room where the official courthouse awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and surely there is no more extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian outlet winner of the first edition, watched her models in Mango's window at the 54th Haussmann boulevard in Paris and cryed almost emotionally.
It is the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, have made us meet at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
As a neighbouring table that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on his heart and doing against bad good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati wears a clothes of Mango and some pair of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arms on it, below with his son Luis - a beautiful man of almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galant man, and the Rotchil Baron finished the evening without clothes because they had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who appeared in the store with a trousers and a shirt - of her own collection - and for dinner changed by endowing a long, sexy and black dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she folded and showed us the room of the ballet repetitions and recalling the good time.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the palace dependences, but she showed us before on her mobile phone the photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his linens, towels and asked beforehand that there would be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenesia of everyday life.
And to crown the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookshops on September 30.
The awakening morning is almost saddened when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when you think about the agitated pace that today's life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the labour world.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Besides the yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and arrives in bookmakers directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some children talk overnight.
I do not refer to those who are awake and tell us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time that happens, it may surprise you, but it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign sleep alteration called sleep sleep.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
There are more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enurerie (do pipi in bed) or sleeping, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very heavy fever, stress or overexcitation.
However, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or, on the contrary, with crying, crying, long speech...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be useful to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We said that it is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration in sleep that can be taken care (e.g., if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid more or less violent TV programs or shows.
With very nervous children and who are hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeps appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is unnecessary because he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t have the temptation to question him for information.
You won’t get anything, because as he sleeps, he is not aware of being able to organize his thought.
Furthermore, you will hear what he says, but you won’t know what he’s dreaming about, then be careful about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even in joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaesern finally regained the path of victory on his field after a long period of disappearance.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Black created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the winning of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting when the attackers had difficulty to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain visitor Kauffmann who broke the carnage on a shot from a distance, Illhaesern was going to take the ascending and turn turning Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the foot or Diebold came to catch Dannemarie's defense.
In the face, we were blocked in the middle of the field and just left the Riahi moving at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to take up a bullet pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhousian buller will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to enjoy it and will not pose any big problems to an Eleven Illusian who just dropped a little back to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of game where, after a big cafouillage, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy encounters angry fishermen
Before flighting to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to take a tour of Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of force of fishermen who heavily disturbed access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he will "come with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the Breton fishermen’s “crisis committee” to achieve measures against the flight of gasoline prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée’s spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and secure the conditions of employment and sailor remuneration.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out scargot operations in the Morbihan and the Calvados, causing nearly 10 km-long caps.
Quiberon’s leisure port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter dam was launched on the island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel deposits in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic facade and the Channel, such as the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the chalets remained in quai, or in Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the major Total Donge refinery in the evening.
The people of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” has to decide on Tuesday on follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will leave nothing" and "do not wish to move to Paris," for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, said.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per liter, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a gasoline below 0.30 euro per liter.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the legend of cinema and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft planner tabled out of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are planning towards the global economy.
The fourth global aeronautics manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered aircraft, the president Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half, the aircraft planner delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to surrender more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have rebound, plans to hand over 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Financial Times Dominican Edition.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retired activity in the United States, the newspaper quotes sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine possible cessions, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the FT added.
No definitive decision has been taken on these cessions, the FT continues.
AIG has to quickly make cash to refund the 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities to take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Historique de la session Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall Monday after the House of Representatives’ rejection of the Paulson Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest fall in his history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index has given 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), at 1,106.55 points, according to the final closure figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street dropped after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Bank Rescue Plan, which was supposed to regain a bit of stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will come "too late."
“If the project is actually dying . . . then the relay will be switched quickly to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And increasing the feeling of emergency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, Mrs. Piegza said.
After Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, pushing to emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signs that markets face “not only a US crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The Treasury's 10-year-old good yield declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday night, and that to 30-year-old to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first TV duel
On Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates succeeded another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic Campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's delivery, although honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in the five-week presidential surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus McCain 44%), believes that the Democrat has pushed his spindle out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, which are those who count, Obama has come out winning for 39% of the surveyed, while 25% of them give McCain the victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good expected performance of his collistry, Joseph Biden, in the first and unique public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“This would be a mistake of underestimating it.
She’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventeen-year-old McCain has been continuing to highlight his indisputable foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he said.
A hammered angle of attack since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama said he was representing the future.
Without dismantling, it has been concise and accurate.
He has highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, yes," a Democratic spot reproached the Republican of not taking the entire measure of the impact of the crisis on the "street American".
“With the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday before 20,000 electoral meeting in North Carolina.
He has not even pronounced the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial distortion clearly advantage Obama, which is considered by Americans as the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“The next week could be a decisive turn,” said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's breakthroughs, Illinois Senator also noted that achieving the country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a 45-nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates have avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “You noticed there was an election, did you?”
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday night on the main square of the Belarus capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday night since the closing of the voting offices on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Lukachenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some confess that they have not even voted, "What's good, because they will do what they want from my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made foreign observers good in order to re-language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarus leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered own by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were held away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the removal," said Youri Potemkine, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that counts the voices, and in us it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry to parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "it is necessary to begin dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the election.
It stresses that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You noticed there was an election, do you?” asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to the parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The night's silence comes back to the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood Become Safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the most safe and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the trust of the public that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such tragedy and to make recommendations for such disaster to no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was too long to file his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, just 38% of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec,” Dr. Decary said.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and field work over the following years, we regained public confidence,” she said before proudly affirming that in the early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had now trusted Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary notes, however, that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the mad cow’s disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, were exhibited in Europe, tells the one that holds the fort since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was then based on that when it is not known and that a serious illness can result from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a brain degeneration leading to death inevitably is introduced exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed more than a month in the UK since 1980 was therefore refused.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated out of doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied was meaningful."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV screening appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allowed to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
TANs have allowed to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood through our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, we have substantially decreased the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that they cannot be detected.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I think today we can feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health,” said Hema-Québec’s head of director.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogens will emerge in the system.
Not later that last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Decary continues before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“Needs grow because the population grows aged.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red or platelet recharge.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network that accounts for an average of only 3% of Quebec donors eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person, 18 years old and older who meets eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is suffering, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Because today’s life is so frightened, we rarely find time spending an hour to give her blood,” Francine Décary says.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood cord bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, is full of a stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We’ve been celebrating a few weeks ago the bank of our thousandth cord blood sample and we’re planning to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Decary, which describes this cord blood sample program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed not to have access to it," because Héma-Québec has no way to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first division, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) victory at the cost of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday at the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in total goals at the Saputo Stadium.
The middle-field Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without purpose on one side as on the other, the middle field David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other networks of Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
The Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps have nevertheless reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Victorious But of Kovalev
The trio number one of Canadians is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 gain from Canadian to dam shooting against the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two helpers, and Kovalev harvested a pass in this winning, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first time," Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the match.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest placed on the North
Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest traveled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Reject the limits of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented visually while remaining in the general lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, some sort of Moulin was projected to images.
They turned in loop, on three immense screens, spectacular clips of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means as in the electoral period.
At the press point, the Prime Minister, on the other hand, refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this autumn, even though he noted that his timetable was very charged.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pan of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and the agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory to the 49th Parallel - had never been presented.
The Prime Minister, however, only explained why the North was "a jewel with huge potential", but did not give expiry, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's list.
This "territory twice large as France", "it's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, it is in us,” he insisted, as to show that he sought a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold road in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatre break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press point.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
"With climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage from the Northwest, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupating the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and the project would benefit them, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with about 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place to start work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” but a time when “a common vision is given.”
Northern development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal Prime Minister who preceded him.
“Like the liberals before us, we thought otherwise to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the party head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed renaming the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, at Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay, our party knew to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press point, he invoked another reference, the conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
By addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper’s hydro-electric dam project, Charest stressed that its implementation was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, raising fed applauses at their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not disrupt the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, what the law allows him.
He points out, however, that his timetable is fulfilled, notably by a mission of the Federation Board in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the major lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
Pequist chief Pauline Marois released the Northern Québec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” said leader Sébastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who comes from holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonorable Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) at Harper's cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say from Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
To throw the disgrace on this woman who has conducted an incessant struggle for justice and deserves our entire admiration in saying as long as on the environment of the Prime Minister as on Stephen Harper himself.
We are here in front of a government that is the only one among all Western countries involved to have not repatriated his citizen locked into the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was an entirely young teenager at the time of the facts he was accused.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its speech and lets a child soldier crowd in inhuman conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
Let us recall, for memory, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Barrier Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes his eyes on torture: it doesn't matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of exactions.
We don't realize yet, but we're now seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," this word that Harper stops branding and sound so hollow in his mouth.
It has come the time that no morality exists anymore: one can evil, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a minority head of government until now (which will therefore be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes the Vert, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Continuing an Orwellian logic, it claims that the world’s largest airifery company has attempted a defamation prosecution of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money to launch a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely occulted by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares supporting a position contrary to his?
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defense and fight against an army of lawyers supported by the almost backgroundless pockets of the mining.
Tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a settlement on the friendly ones, which will scare the opposition in addition to fearing anyone who dares to look at the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of facts.
Unlike what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debate in Canada is usually done by the exchange of ideas and not by matrack.
It was therefore enough for the mining to open its books, records and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have made the light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how he can simultaneously ask for a "public" debate while contemplating the opinions of the same audience?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even the detractors are entitled to speech.
What doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers primarily does so because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
The audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a pursuit (continuing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just put a stand-up to the authors in Black Canada inciting them to cease this use).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in a block, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are unpleasant to the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the writers of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The academic environment, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate prosecution clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit such abuse prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to break the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months must still be approved by the two Congress Chambers.
It includes, in particular, a better control by the elected of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of public money engaged, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure of payment, and a right to look at salaries paid to the leaders of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiation table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"All has been done in a way to protect the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis at Wall Street," the Democrat said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in recent hours because of fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on investors' mood.
The deadline was the opening of markets this morning.
Associated late with the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election showed themselves rather favorable to the agreement, but without expressing their dissatisfaction that we were forced to achieve it at this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has awarded himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the provisions aimed at allowing owners to retain their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of the government-backed companies.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of some’s irresponsibility, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope yes."
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that this is something we’ll all have to digest and with which we’ll be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to purchase with the money of taxpayers the doubtful, risky and insolvable claims of the U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the breakdown of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits (subprimes) before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and banking and financial banking institutions.
It was a group of Republican elects who had capotered the first agreement project last week.
It is believed that it has been out of this impasse since Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" assets of difficulty companies are only insured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone at the Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its payment.
The new plan provides the payment of a first 250 billion range to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be agreed by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the rescued companies that will be worth dividend in the event of profit and that he will be able to sell back when the torment is passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing attached to real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the compensation and departure compensation paid to the leaders of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see him submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green light.
Indeed, voices continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, said at the address of his voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to take advantage of taxpayers.”
Animator of a small group at the Congress called "The Caucus of the Sceptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things otherwise, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prize, have written to tell us: we are asked at the Congress not to press and look carefully at the path to take,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it refused to acquire its shipwreck competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the U.S. risk loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In exchange, a voting right is obtained in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savings and households now appreciate that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the way of nationalizing another bank maltrained by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would regain all current loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the British bank’s branches and customer accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the UK government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon engaged
His beauty with blue eyes was long his map, some will say his weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissical mirror, the charming American actor?
Yes and no.
His pureness, sensitivity and a talent that flows from the source will also have taken him away from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a big background runner!
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years old, as a result of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons of American movies of fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like and whom he was long a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without demetered ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
Because there was an entire country eager to self made man, from the fighter of the Pacific War, injured to the fight, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning at theatre, television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the car driver who ranked second at 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discreet, committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the breakthroughs of the show-business, whose enigma will not have been completely broken up.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman gained the vertigo to filmmakers this weekend, while his major roles are shocked on the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation scroll through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an adapted burning roof by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
The closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all his promises.
So many others, Paul Newman, have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really released Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (The Fool), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeant billiard player in the magnificent The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume the character on the return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who earned him his unique Oscar for nine nominations in 1987.
This face through the ages was him.
Once again.
Epochs bounce through their path.
Young people know him especially through George Roy Hill’s cultism Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen Brothers.
With a latest role as the Irish mafia sponsor in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several legends of the cinema that released the trade early enough, Newman will stay in saddle for a long time while denouncing Hollywood, his golds, fastings and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell all cooked in the bell for a long time.
However, he played less often the first young people than the marginals: neurotics, alcoholics, slaughterfuls or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected derivatives and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drawn a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose devoted him to his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of purety and sadness.
Among the homage rain that deferred yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence made my life better and this pays better."
Generosity, love for existence are vibrant characteristics of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his legend career, a major activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, is also destroyed.
We'll have seen a lot of her binette standing on pots of vinegarette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of enough bad taste, although gag initially.
Nevertheless, the profits of these sales were paid to the Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Model citizen, in sum and in other words.
What could Zusatz &amp; Company make in their invoices factory?
Next, on October 8, hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zusatz and his complices.
The politician and his complices are accused of permanent and regular fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, having caused particularly significant damage. Other charges were held against them, such as false use and false use.
According to the prosecution, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the boxes of the Fiatal Balondal movement and on the other, in some people's pockets.
Their method, also made public by the inquiry authorities, was to reach the money of grants obtained by sending fees invoices, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, the associations never met their commitments.
According to the accusation, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for books of invoices at the Józsefváros market, while they were making the cashews in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies on the bills, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, conducted by István Lados, at the request of János Zusatz.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices they would introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his complice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary to obtain grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zusatz in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
According to the manager, however, it would have been impossible that so many people occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőert Foundation, which will subsequently bear the name of Egyptian to Harmadik Évezredért, crawls of shape and background mistakes.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night, yet the bill mentioned a hundred and thirty guests.
The exhausting imagination invoice issuers also fell in excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőert nor the name of Hoppa appeared, according to the prosecutor's information.
Győző Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the bills, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"Our company's name and tax number were placed in a wrong place on the shell."
He added: “Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, did not stick there either, since this establishment only counts eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time.”
The zealous invoices issuers have also not reported about the Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while benefits relating to travel activities, whose destination is located outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel at the order of Job Jövőert was incorrect, as the company's benefits do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecutor’s survey reveals that the “emitters” also made mistakes by mentioning as road carriage, that the invoicing company could not exercise, as its profile was the investment council.
Furthermore, it is also for defects of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false caches, that invoices issued under Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, 21st, were revealed false.
Just like in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó’s sporting workshop, who both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The falsemen did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Varosert Egyesület group was supposed to eat a meal at their home. According to our information, this is why the liquidator of the company denied to issue this invoice.
Deliberately established facts
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were quite aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestert Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Balodal - Ifjú Szocialistak group, has established an invoice at the order of the Egyutt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accusation, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with Zuschläges, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and in 2003 issued invoices on the order of the Job Jövőrt Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vöörsfenyő Egyesület Association, which were provided for no more than five million HUF.
No financial movement took place either, since the invoices issued were cancelled subsequently, but that has been avoided by the agencies to mention it in their accounting.
The following category of invoice issuer companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft., who was concerned with fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices regarding the sale of IT equipment, for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft. company, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov had also submitted documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egyutt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not getting work.
He still served these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as writer of the company founding acts, he established invoices on their names, on the order of associations relating to Zusatz, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generácio.
Kubatov gave agencies, a total of 15 invoices, issued by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on invoices as well as VAT were going into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that have been used as part of the request for grant from Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generácio and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért filed a subsidy application from the Socialist Party’s public utility agency, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To prevent this from known, five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these invoices were found during the search carried out at the Arpád Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of manufacturing invoices, as it had previously done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zusatz himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
Until now, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done it.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or then, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the refund of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the applications for his placement in a supervised residence, based on a mitigation of his detention conditions, continually fall into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of non-repairable economic offences, run freely or at least, await at their own home the end of the procedure.
The psychology of the surgery: why do we spend more money?
When auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economy at the University of New York managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the Science magazine, human beings don’t want to be distant during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay a too high price.
These researches have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the groups of volunteers played lotto, while the other group participated in playing auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (MRI), the researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the scale of a third, the whole underneath the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained with the leakage from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overwhelming to face a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus performed their payment.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they went out winning the game, then they would receive additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received those $15 prior to the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the focus was placed in one on victory, while in the other, on failure.
In this way proving the hypothesis of neurologs, members of the player’s team “counter failure” were ready to better bets than those made by the control group and the group “for victory”.
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed in auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to suppress the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
An estimated one hundred miles of patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is because often sick people do not know they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on pathogens, spread primarily in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperma, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowness develops on the skin and on the white eye, the stools become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, a million people each year die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to reach the virus, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a manner. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis are figured worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor treating as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be healed, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by agencies representing sick people from all corners of the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford achieved an interesting experience by analyzing what level the belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this experience for the least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many Atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpating the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, to which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting the sparks and diffusing the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to sustainedly watch two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the source of this experience hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, bears her calming effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electrochocs in four subsequent, while watching either religious theme painting or more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like “safe,” like someone whose “care is taken” and they “calmed up, and peace invaded them.”
In view of religious thematic painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, believes that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image facing which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber is shown to believers?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, it is not enough yet, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of the society.
While in terms of scepticians establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the essential part of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google founders can meet their initial goal that sounded as follows: “Gather in a system all the information in the world!”
According to Google’s leader in question, after ten years of a world-class work, they are always only at the beginning of their goals to be able to handle all the information.
Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What work would I do best?". However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply at first glance, that on the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages then viewed by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Customized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and see what they sought, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, long-term Recommendations, program based on the same logical, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and we will submit our preceding products and services based on our preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? asks users, who are worried seeing the monopoly of Google information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or eventually revolt against power that can provoke counterresponse among internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms requested are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most remarkable example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus enabling identification.
Human rights-related users have been able to push a relief breath in May last, when Google, below with the Electronic Legal Protection Agency EFF, proved its right to the court in the face of the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google can still not be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the secret request of the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully gained about 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago, but in the end, it failed to purchase the lists of private user searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it’s furnished by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google’s services, so they attack them in the spirit of revolt that we manifest against multinational societies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savings" gathering the enthusiasts, activists, and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of large companies, the "linked corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the world's invader because of Windows, and even if both struggle.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, in the face of the official software giant’s practice.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, shoots just behind it.
Indeed, the web 2.0 does not concern anything but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose.
A young man, in general, can hold a profile on multiple public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a recent tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can hold their more automatic apps on F.
While we can get to know many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning pictures, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her infidel friend has spent the evening, or that of the society who has completely dismissed one of her employees, is only for the sincere opinions that this girlfriend wrowed on her blog on top management.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today’s young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not smaller. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge better parks and our servers.
The public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense ad domains threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasing speed of many other Microsoft programs, not only serious migrands.
However, critical observers find, next to all this, contradictions with concerning effects: for example, the top management of the society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the Chinese corporate maternity price, and after the society has considered the interests of the daily multiple restoration, no matter how well it seems.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, new services are not only announced when they can be used. What is about is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world from new points. While some think that the medical scan and archiving project of the U.S. and Google magazines might take so important dimensions that our Society is going to face us shortly.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a scary way only through Google data.
Two minors helped disappear traces of the dual killing of Ózd
"The police called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the dual murder of Ozd. According to founded suspects, they helped eliminate the traces of the crime," said Borsod Department of Police.
The young people have recognized the facts that are accused of them, and they are now accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, defend themselves free.
Murder complicity can lead to detention up to five years.
The suspect of the dual murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old young man, was placed in preliminary detention on Sunday.
The heads of charges held against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, he found that the 23-year-old owed a huge amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect didn’t want to pay his debt and that’s why he attracted his creditor last Wednesday at an Ozd site where he killed him, as well as the nine-year-old daughter of that man.
According to MTI's information, the young man premedited his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at crime locations is evidence.
The police examines the weapons and circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite previously the Czechs have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech Economic Daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer so far for the purchase of the Prague exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer until today.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the stakeholders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market experts.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague scholarship is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent of shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
Financial crisis from the European Press Perspective
In their comments on the international financial crisis on Tuesday, increasing from day to day, European press newspapers already mention a "second September 11".
"The overall financial disaster is owed to the U.S. President" - accuses Rome's daily La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a proposal of law, improvised at once, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as reported by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the goat issuer in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo’s vision, it is the lack of the political management there that has brought the global economy to the edge of the collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the entire world will pay the high price.
Bush’s plan was far from being perfect, however, according to the congress’s vote, a real danger threat, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just at the time when in capitalism’s history, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat longer, underlines the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still lead a rescue bush to their tituban financial agencies, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks like dominos fall down, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union states to make little cases of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday only, weak financial agencies have received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in pocket, very deeply similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from a part to a part.
The "saviors" should not immediately break up a hundred billion euros, but it would be useful if they noticed in which case it would be rational to affect taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Intelligent cars mimic the bourdon’s theft
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, unless the imitation of an already existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the bees gave Nissan’s strategic starting idea to inspire them on how they need to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotized control system of type BR23C, which has equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own, oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell, Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the brand’s department of research and development and technology public relations, said at the exhibition.
The facet eye of the bee plays a vital role, as it is capable of seeing in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, then the mini-auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system today, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t so, the mini-auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is now considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eye climb.
On the opposite of the bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary movement, acceleration and slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini-auto robot.
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is larger, making their lifetime longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is essential, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only handle a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvres. In this way, it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
We don't need memory of a giga-byte capacity, nor even mega-byte.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology to instantly avoid. According to Nissan’s estimates, this system will enter series-made cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding the obstacles on his way.
We have even given the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Plan, aimed at purchasing the doubtful credits of the banks, and to use on several occasions, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates running until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the eastern coast, Congress leaders have agreed on controversy for days and days, around the total $700 billion rescue plan.
“We have made a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, according to which we only have to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however, other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not about the rescue of Wall Street here, but to turn the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the scholarships.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will be the first to vote for the bill on the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also greeted the news of the agreement.
“We are satisfied with the advanced achieved tonight, and we highly appreciate both parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
Furthermore, the programme differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent once, for the purchase of securities relating to doubtful credits.
From now on, maximum half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the law was adopted by the Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will serve the Treasury Secretary to buy dubious debts from the banks, while the use of additional $100 billion will be left at the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
According to the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time it will be able to purchase dubious debts, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The department's competent persons said that purchases may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives companies the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools caused by concerns, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of doubtful debts, their insurance, or avoid the risk of the system driving the collapse of one or another important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary arrangements, to be ready to enforce the law as soon as it will be signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in poor positions and waiting for the State’s aid can expect their starting compensation, simply called the golden outer Atlantic parachute, to be broken down by the government.
The wages are mentioned only in very specific cases and the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of plating means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases as part of an auction, they will take an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president leaves retirement.
Directly after the purchase of doubtful claims, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exceeded.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that existing golden parachutes are not modified. The plating only relates to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
It’s the first time in the history of the United States that legal deployments will be in force regarding appointments of directors- said the Chairman of the Commission in charge of the Chamber of Deputies’ financial benefits, Democrat Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State is entitled to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, so that the risk of taxpayers will decrease, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will return to their legs.
The bill states that within the next five years, the Chairman must introduce to the Congress a proposal that will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts regarding this plan.
That’s not why American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect the dollars from taxpayers,” California’s Republican MP Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same ones who urge to take steps, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will we need a visa next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance for the American-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement to come into force by 12 January, which is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "Now, everything depends only on the time the over-Atlantic electronic entry and control systems will be put into operation."
At all times, she has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will need to register before departure.
The leader of Hungary’s diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion rescue plan, however, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives at Congress and the Administration finally announced Sunday in the morning that they concluded principle agreements on the rescue plan of banks.
This funding plan, which aims to defrost the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more suitable than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the focus on economic issues, Obama once again managed to get a little advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a collister just after the Republican Convention, founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope to see the Congress quickly vote the 700 billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that it also supports.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he said in a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn’t miss to qualify McCain’s economic ideas as exceeded.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said, “We will all have trouble to swallow it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible pathway.”
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Committee and the departure compensation of senior leaders, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play a role on the background in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Chairman of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the Chamber will vote the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers".
According to this recognized politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now the same modern citizens turn their back.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also Angela Merker's.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday a process that was likely just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the fifty-years, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to modernization "devouring his parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
For 40 years sociologues have announced this but they have been heavily misleading with respect to the pace, however, the secularization, the results of the education and establishment of Germans from north and east in the Bavaria region, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes in conjunction with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only inside the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more enthusiastic.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, the groups of classic citizens have rather far away from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, box holders and senior graduates.
In these groups, support to the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The Party Presidents stand on the reserve faced with the coalition issues," the conservative Austrian daily addresses the situation of confusing internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the ÖVP conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from mixing with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations, but the greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
Elections took place, now everything turns around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders barely let their cards interview.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed he wanted to talk with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of both parties is effectively possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the proposals of the red.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to engage in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a quite open matter, which must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"In order to avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, began the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities, whose host is France, as representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message presented before the Plenary Assembly, as one of the main spokesmans of the consultation of experts, Ms. Fidesz European People's Party, Lívia Járóka draws attention to segregations in education, as it is a violation of the right that affects the most successful children in Roma and therefore, one of the main freedoms of their lives.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the MP Fidesz Parti Popular group, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions observed during hiring, the Roma disappear from the labour market, firstly as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Romans have no secondary degrees, and as a result of a poor-quality elementary education, only a small party has the possibility of obtaining a graduate degree."
Furthermore, Járóka emphasized that education as a basic human right plays a key role in applying other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of member countries of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, it is necessary to become aware of these relations in a broader circle as possible, also between Romans and non-Roms.
Indeed, the earlier a Roman child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, Romans must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education."
According to the MEP, an objective-oriented collaboration of the European Union and an action is needed to accelerate the process of desegregation of schools immediately, so that compliance with existing and prepared anti-discrimination guidelines is of primary importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the possibilities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of full right in the future of Europe."
On behalf of the "European Year for Equality of Opportunities" guaranteed for all, the goal of the Summit for Equality of Opportunities in Europe held every year since the Summit in Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken towards equality and discrimination, targeted at European and member state level.
CSU: Grace for a Transitional Period
In October, the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this pityful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been delayed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent voice loss, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized pair felt that they didn't especially stand at their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to soothe the angry members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the top of his career - the Socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the “one sovereign” of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives are still strongly counting in this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates debates with the potential liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing statements.
A strange foot of fate was that with the help of the List of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as the possibility of putsch performed by the Huber-Beckstein duo, to then treat without planning the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pushed the backgrounds, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the bitterest day in his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some remarks to the CDU, and he said they would deserve much more support from the brother’s party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only again be a chancellor if they re-established in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of CSU’s field will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
What is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Socio-Democrats lasts forever.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
None of the opposition members accessed the Belarus parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, who ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Safety and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegality committed during the removal of votes.
OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation consisting of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well oppositioning for many decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that the 2006 presence of a few amendments, renewing its mandate of president for the fourth time in election.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relationships with the EU, where because of the Belarus political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-powered politicians have always received a decline of Russian credit visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition of Belarus.
The fact that OSCE, during the assessment of the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than failures, such as the prohibition of presentation for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior soothing.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already disputed the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and especially the fact that the opposition could not be present during the removal of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the separate Southern Ossetia and Abazzia from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backward, but the most important thing is that dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the 2006 presidential election opposition, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring even one opponent into".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in view of the results, but rather attempts to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns about this: we must print our opponent newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put sticks on our wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are becoming more and more official to support the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the social security system.
"Because of the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is no longer a matter of time," Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the lack of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarus voters.
Brunetta: "From today breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure against the little wicked is in force, against whom he points out and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during the hours of work.
The anti-fainting news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
“The rotary doors,” says Brunetta, “is an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says the minister.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"This is reformism," also emphasizes Brunetta.
The facility in all the establishments of the Council Presidency is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, “the choice of rotating doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General says: “This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all.”
In short, more breakfast during work hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests by smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and happy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of the Public Administration
“In three months, the absence of public employee disease has reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year.”
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "including the wage dynamics," the minister explains - over the past 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and much beyond the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to contestate the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Function today explains data about the decline in absenteeism at the workplace because of illness," writes the consumer association- the people of "active faintings" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees gathered to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar disputes the exclusion of additional allocations in the event of invalidity due to service; the prolongation of the timetables of the sick worker's domicile, during which monitoring visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Numbers that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice more death than killings.
To have the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Amyl celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the Victims of Labour Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The concerning data broadcast by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention on the workplace,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort to prevent workplaces, protect accidental workers, assistance to victim families and awareness of public opinion.
“Naturally indignated, everyone has hit the hands to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, raise the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even though daily reality presents us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information."
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people who enter the labour world.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, Chairman of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini emphasized how "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults each of us' consciousness, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to quickly end it."
Data on the accidental work seems to indicate a slightly positive trend, but this doesn’t prevent the number of white deaths to be still impressive,” Anniversary President Pietro Mercandelli said later.
"We do not want this 'discount trend' to actually translate into a minor attention, because it is just when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We emphasized Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, just as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added: "We must still make an effort with regard to the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
"But most importantly, a greater sense of responsibility by employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the planned compensation for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivative to which the system is oriented in recent years".
“The goal is therefore to give the worker back the insurance guarantee,” he added, “so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator.”
Mp3 reader pointed by the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening full-volume music for a prolonged period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announced, which, in a statement broadcast in Brussels, cites the Scientific Committee's opinion on the EU's unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri), published today.
“In this scientific report we read, it shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour a day and week, are at risk of a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“According to the scientific data,” the Ue manager continues, “this is a clear risk and we need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumers awareness and make this domain information public.
In addition, we need to review the existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are completely effective and can follow new technologies.”
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"The scientists, concluded by the executive Ue, confirm that there are good reasons to worry about, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other stakeholders, which measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but an increased concern about hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to well limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, listening to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed currently existing limits for the maximum noise level consented on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to approximately 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will pull out the amounts.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Caracalla Thermes.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, the Committee and the Common Council will assess analyses and projects, in order to be presented in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official Stage" of Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there," Alemanno said, "it will have to propose the development ideas of Rome, which can be used by political decision makers, which remain the Committee and the Common Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the willingness to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is undermined by the management of the daily and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper prospective, working seriously in the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to emphasize that "this Commission is not an unnecessary organization or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost an euro to Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unit spirit."
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipal borders, but will look further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also in relation to the role Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wishes to become independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relationships (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date is closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really clothed: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that counts at all, two governors and five black senators.
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it’s still about someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern US bowels wrote an article: Once in the voting cabin, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
This is an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Tell what you want, we’ll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Nonetheless, despite all these reasons, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to her house at the foot.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have died, and Americans have not been forced to make bags.
Despite this, Iraq was mostly the point of weakness of Bush.
Who takes the place of George W will have a huge spot to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it's time for suppression, and many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were arrested by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to information stakeholders, feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the removals carried out in the newsroom, in the room where writers work at the newspaper assembly, are a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if we wish that traditional journalism as the general public understands, it will not be reduced substantially.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and printing newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest editor houses took a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "assassin" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to getting into technology hoping it will “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest cracker in American journalism lies between those who lead the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national directors are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, this is related to “safety of work”.
Directors who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, we are 30%.
The "safe work" at the level of staff (our writers, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an enormous nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, journals, radio, television and internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
The directors almost always receive big wages, while the editor can earn $10 thousand per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payment.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days overall, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
That's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATE.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the officer of real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
Coppola is surveyed for bankrott as part of the Unipol-Bnl Climbing Instruction.
During the trial at charge last week, he had obtained the liberation of household transformed into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the pm has not granted) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago, with the Chamber of Representatives’ vote, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a lot of significant Americans were, and still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its previous soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington and the world of finance, especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, precisely, which made itself feel despotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake predicts or already leaves running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so much that in the new climate they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary recovery, of the double category sovereign state, compared to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close relationships with the foreign, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheet of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically globally but politically, it is almost only in this country.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or has nothing to say: the evident evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, is shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political lines.
And thus, it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, plans of rescue and recovery, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when we go through a difficult period, there are only States that possess economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to restore things into place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever be able to have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-major importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a fairly related factor to this element: territoriality.
Indeed, as we were convinced that we have now entered the kingdom of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance is now intended to dominate the world, we have realized a single blow, that our future will, on the contrary, have to set its accounts with the ever more sophisticated things as the little material harvest.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are absolutely linked to a surrounded space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, has certainly more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now get to the second news that however plans a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
From one side, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even concerning: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distantness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus, the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far at their top, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, undergroundly feeds a powerful and branched movement of delegations of ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in improvised electoral revolts, or, in the changes in the collective moods of the last time, he could not be the Bush and the right-wing Italy against the Great Britain, from the conservative work in Austria.
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have ever more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and therefore represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis potentially increases, and agitates.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But you say, keep your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercollar to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a battery of spaghetti." explains Zhong Lin Wang at Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Scientists have inspired themselves from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hair that ensure the animal is a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, “it’s easily removed from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton’s Engineering Faculty.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? – “This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Can be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are heat and electrical current conductors.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
OTHER SEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented a microfiber-formed adhesive, which self-cleaning dust during movement on a surface to guarantee perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially consumed in summer because dealtant and high in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
Professor David Nailey, at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, whether associated with the intake of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm of drugs, risking to reduce some of them.
Grapefruit juice has already been highly criticized because it was held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal, and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
This is the Italian Drug Agency itself, which had announced the news in a two-year newsletter, warns doctors and patients not under assessment of the hazard derived from this mixture and to pay attention to the drinking of drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juice.
From there, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally reported immediately to various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informational notes of the drugs as needed.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs we take, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to clearly talk to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert said in a statement.
Nobel Award for Economics by Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of Bush’s foreign economy and policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that broke out many controversies, which was reproached to the economist for years, but now proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked about the rapidity with which the remembering of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great-value economist,” but also a very aggressive discloser in style, particularly critical towards the excess liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of broadcasting OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following an almost one-year work, performed by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to others more important, such as the compatibility for the Apple operating system, the latest ISO OS X format, and the new ODF format.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain features specific to certain modules, such as that which reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic design module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that bind the typical Adobe format chart with the elements of a sheet or a text developer.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the computing sheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the development of texts, as each employee is awarded a colour of comments for better revision recognition.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final outcome.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped at home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to stream it in houses, it's just in business, that Open Office's suite is the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
In addition to the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business forecasts.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent writing video; Calc, is the computing sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint’s rival presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the suit of the best climber.
This is the site of the newspaper The Team reporting the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl’s tests are part of those conducted in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity of Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will strongly expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s third-generation positivity at the Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus ripping the highest climbing suit.
IMMIGRES: New York Times is asked if Italy is racist?
Italy "as a Country of Immigrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
Would this turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? That is what the New York Times devoted a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, departing from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was born from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Northern regions are both those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also "a strongest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega."
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature desired by the Lega to break immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestines, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Giorgio Napolitano, at his meeting with Benedict XVI at Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
Student rental market does not know any crisis
According to Sunia’s latest survey, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the exemption of the whole categories of young people, from the right to study due to the high global costs that originating families must support,” explains the head of the Sunia Studies Office, Laura Mariani.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, sub-locations.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax tax are necessary to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, the minimum of 650 euros (Bande Nere area), at an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus in areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), it is required about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single, it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra community students, are recorded a subsequent anomalie: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities elect the historical rooms.
Historical cinema halls close in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in large Italian urban centers, but also in province cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multi-sales, and the death of the mono-halls in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and unquestionable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
"It's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of path and so many emotions" observes the filmmaker of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso live, a film that can always be offered to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes and the Sword of Sword.
The figures provided by Anec, the main merchant association, mean everything: over the past five years, 316 traditional movies have closed, and are the rooms of major cities that have primarily paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is at the head with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sales cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilie-Romagne.
“It is useful to build new structures, but it should still be guaranteed the survival of those already existing, because when a farm room in a city, these attendees are not all willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the missing deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the state's history debt is about 10 million euros.
It is ashamed that, from a moral and ethical point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Let’s note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote cinemas mono rooms in historical and peripheral centres.
Among the planned regulators, there are tax facilities for managers and mobility benefits for the public: viewers will be able to enter the limited traffic area and have special rates for parkings and in some parking spaces.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closing of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" that I have been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I passed ahead of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black signs by dust.
Links between politics and andrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
Heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria, towards the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little son, the boss' homonym, already convicted for association of mafia-type evildoers, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
“A confrontation with legal and moral normatives, and above all with good sense,” the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"This would have been granted to the clan to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of public administration's control and guidance."
The Chairman of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the andrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests of this morning follow those of July last year, following which police announced to have decapitated the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April last, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, was appointed head of a right-wing center coalition, after the May 2006 vote.
He created the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused Vice Minister of Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating the whole for a political matter, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the change in the A3 project.
Because of the ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, it emerged "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now bigs start.
This is a dismeasurable placement that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the largest global energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for now hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental bodies and the new increase in oil give the sector a great rise.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity need could be covered by sea shell operating systems.
This amount would be twice the amount that nuclear power plants produce.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colosses in the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, one would have said a true revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies devoted to traditional energy have always been relying on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesman of a company associated with the colossale American oil, in the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, and evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate license by the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to lead to a project of marine energy exploitation in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that just in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to be upgraded.
Experts talk about technology still at its beginning, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dissipate the fears of environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of mud connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and part of energy could serve a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during tides rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves at the moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it’s just about tide energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, invested $7 and a half in 2008 and expected investments up to 35 million in 2009.
