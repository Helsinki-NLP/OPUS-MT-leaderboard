Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, a total of 29 percent
A notable weakening of both parties in the previous major coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preliminary parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria after the first preliminary results.
Particularly heavily lost the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), where the position of previous Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the board.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner state-major Jörg Haider, is equipped for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, the social democracy (SPO) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but loses 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse cuts the OVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People’s Party, which had requested the preliminary elections, is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear advance from the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculation about a possible resignation of the chairman of the party and previous Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Board of the Party.
Such a development would probably embrace the way to the most likely exit from the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberians (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, when the People's Party had even reached the common government with the populist arrangements (while, the FPÖ was still unified in 2005).
Towards this development, obviously, Jörg Haider, who already declared he is willing to work with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
The Party of the Greens, however, has suffered slight losses and has broken between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party probably mastered the four-percent height and did not move to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India Can Cool
If it is unable to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the illegally collection of cages, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes it might come to a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
“If this doesn’t clear, then surely, it’s a certain cooling,” he explained after a meeting took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in court matters.
In spite of all, he suggested that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released by the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of freedom, Mukherdshi’s view would be the best if he would appeal to a higher instance.
He could thus request freedom on deposit and in freedom waiting for his judgment, the Minister says.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner speaks the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal to a higher court, then a mercy would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the entire matter is to give the convicted “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such aid is already offered by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge that,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, reaffirmed the Czech Republic to assess the problem of Czech entomologs.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister departed.
“I have already been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech is directed over rings around the sea ground
It approaches an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are illustrated.
However, it is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-headed staff team of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His chief, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
Here exist workplace and enthusiasm.
The sea ground has so far a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, expanding brass and other non-regenerative raw materials, but also unknown organisms, which, for example, bear the key to developing a cancer drug.
A sea ground greater than the continent
The Anrainer states today strongly announced their right to the new marine areas.
According to a UN Convention, they use their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often comes into the sea to a few hundred kilometres away from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“Simply expressed, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the ocean floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the ocean surface.
It crosses the borders of the shores, often also the border of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission for the establishment of the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific-technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated more than five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
To date, only the last three countries were successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently encountered Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the marine bottom, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that flows to them from the use of the marine bottom in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment when you ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the territory of the ocean ground, which is called by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area grants an international institution established by the Convention.
“But the sea floor is not a gold-gravery country,” says with some overdriving director Mikulka and adds, whose “individual areas are legally accurately defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the sea base is also part of the Czech Republic today.
She shares it with other states of the former Eastern block within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the convention, as well as the investors of some fewer other states, received the status of a so-called "based investor".
The organization has the right to promote the ClarionClipperton zone in the silent ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea bottom is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the sea bottom.
“It is possible to ship on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetal concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concrete as a pattern.
She reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, the beautiful scheme that the legend raised to life after the Golem.
German specialist forces were on the site for hostages' exemption
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the gender crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not use.
On the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defense and Interior, German specialist forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Therefore, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the Bundespolice's flyer staffel, the Bundescriminal Office, and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Plant were at the place of liberation.
As spokesmans told the ministries on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed because the hostagemen left their prisoners running and fleeing when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it as support forces on site.
"Fortunately, it hasn't happened to this," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were carried out.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the last, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued people have now reached Cairo well.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not express details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they return to Germany.
According to "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the specialist forces are expected to be flighted with an Airbus Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones shouted in the depth.
With 206-227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to prevent chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately attempted to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations leaders, had called on the members to agree even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones earned more than six percent or 600 points.
Reasons to investors were concerns, the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after being known of the failure, to fall back.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order to enter into force the programme, the approval of both the House of Parliament and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record increased booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In travel bookings for the next few months, sales has increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
In spite of weak economic perspectives, a study shows that the Germans’ travel pleasure remains untrue.
During the bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a revenue plus of 31 percent compared to the previous year period, as the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute’s investigation, booking numbers have already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover of the travel agencies for October was about eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results is the numbers of GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies per month and highly calculated for the overall market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, traveling to the US was particularly asked, the DRV said.
Here the booking growth amounts to approximately one-third.
Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes of the Germans are particularly sought after.
In particular, packages are high in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for customers than during individually organized holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, by early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so a revenue surplus will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip dropped compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter pen and promises in Designer-Dirndln.
A debut.
Susanne Kronsugar and I don’t have much together.
She is a blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: little on three minutes on the wilderness, the photographers already drop on us and knip the memory cards fully - very sweet and that on my first wilderness visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap girl seems to meet its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white-white.
But once I arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks reluctant or shamefully touched - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate stand only harvest my dirndl sparks.
A Munich girl warns me that I had wrongly bound the shell: "Left hoasts free, mid virgin, right, widowed back."
Homely I frighten the loop from back to left.
"Suit," he said and laughed.
Others make less efforts for subtle flirting techniques and wear simply filtered shelves on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch an unpleasant against the naked backpiece.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes named Bob, comes from England and visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-traced "oooooo".
This is what he tells me, after he has removed his previously drinked measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he is a garbage tray.
So Bob is one of those famous "Wildbiesers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, healthcare providers run in sharks over the festive square that need to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the roller - always four at once drag a covered wear from tent to tent.
It works like most of the visitors: empty, fully back.
Anyone who is in the promille sack below the plane cannot be seen.
"There are those where goarnimmer pack," one of the health care providers called on request and disappeared in the mouth.
Name of the accident victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after she was attacked by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lived at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road in the city center on Friday afternoon.
She was brought to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of lightweight driving.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey endeavored to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deeply the backland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the stairs with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building breaks down about
But when you are within the twisted ticket switch, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the project whose westernmost access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late player in the imperialist game, had before implementing its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what Saudi Arabia is today.
However, Germany’s imperialistic projects were laid down during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the inconceivable boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, an ammunition train fled into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly broken down, largely passed through history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to emphasize the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approach.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relationships with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To be able to assess the corner data of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a fast ride on railways that produced the step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city for the new secular state project, the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP’s headquarters, a specially-made, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in an evolving suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and pubs in which medium managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, cravate, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
The aim of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighboring countries.
“The Cold War was an exception,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its backland.
Nowadays, they have to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn’t be either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
“But Turkey could certainly be forced to decide sometime,” I asked.
"Turkey," he said, "want to have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with almost routinely said: the relationships of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as advantageous for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transferred sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the equal railways eastward to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpasha’s train station, after another largely sleeping night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, too large parts, be in Turkey’s hands.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time there seemed no doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley (September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir singed for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological forms changer) was for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been late for years.
How often we thought death to "leave music to speak for themselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and accurate, never heristic but never excessive.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader had been beaten to be knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well over the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years I have written criticisms for more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one – often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He hated leaders who, according to his words, just went home with one or two well-known show horses in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he took over teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author’s note in Woodruff’s book “Beyond Nab End,” but it’s not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as the British rubber industry in 1958.
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States during a Houblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham finally and went to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff wanted to squeeze this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his photographs are fantastic in black-white, documentary style.
They brought me attentively to them because of their simplicity and the strength they emit, as they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.”
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda seeks to market the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, so this large-space limousine offers a much larger.
This also includes the technical finesses that allow even more convenient driving and petrol savings.
changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this big limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are intended to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon regarding its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz was released on the market, roughly one million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the Old Continent, with approximately half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sale at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the stores in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models a year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows for the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is based on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters length, which Japanese companies hope to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In terms of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase of dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that has also been used in the predecessor model of jazz.
Also the capacity of the bagroom, which has a system of double charging surface, reachs up to 339 liters, which is 19 liters greater than the capacity of the first generation bagroom.
It should be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz bagroom with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379-liter.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The second generation engines of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides rotary moments power for the entire motor life.
The first 1.2-liter variant achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reached 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, it now achieves 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-bean' that avoids collision
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight derives from the behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
Engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collision.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important is the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to rebuild the whole perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and lie in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for the avoidance of the collision.
At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately switch the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even bigger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasion manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot differ up or down, but cannot overcover; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotational function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids the collision.
`This device only requires a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the manufactured manufacturers, so it can work continuously with only a dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan has been introducing to the series cars over the next 10 years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and maintain longer than the variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target driving while avoiding the obstacles on the road.
She's trembling before she's burdened with a mortgage.
It must be seen that the U.S. Ministry of Finance except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but it is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the U.S. citizens being involved in mortgage stories of allegedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no loan.
And above all where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a page for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the start of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a newness due to a strong case of its exchange rate.
A week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stocks at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price value of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible shares that will be secured a 10% profit and can be sold back at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be made on the basis of a single average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley stock dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which is intended to enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its stocks for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, “we believe that the participation would be fully made up of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by approximately 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter referred to within a given deadline is exchanged to more than 50% above the sales value, that is to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press spokesman of the group refused to provide more details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After investing MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to account for a payment rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that he had "definitely" decreased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to watch with as their exchange rate dropped by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity increased to the sum.
This price dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivors’ of the major investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, in part to have picked up at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-established the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
The third was the one who, following this Sunday, the example of his like-minded and friends, made the plan of a new constitution to the election.
According to 80% of voters’ public results, 64% voted “Yes” in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the voting chart were invalid and 0.7% were issued empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional project, more than half of all votes must be made.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the outputs of the election sites and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for ‘Yes’, and prophesied it 63% to 70%.
On Sunday night on Monday, Rafael Correa called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution' triumphed in an overwhelming way, he had insured in Guayaquil, the headquarters of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa from Chávez and Morales, but also congratulated by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the Observatory Order of the Organization of American States (OAS) referred to a text of 444 points to secure the "new socialism", for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by allowing it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country living largely from oil production by foreign companies and foreign currency sending migrants to the country.
The project, which is driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to perform up to two consecutive mandates of each four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty limit.
Ultimately, she also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Equatorian base as a starting station for American anti-drug inserts.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were kept captive for eleven days in the desert, were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, hostages reached the military base of al-Maza directly next to Cairo’s international airport at about 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without having to talk to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all of the "best health" and the kidnappers weren't paid a ransom, Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the roll field.
After being captured on September 19 at a land car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the hostages were repeatedly brought to the next door by 35 unknown kidnappers.
They are eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian safety official said 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“Shots fell on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remaining fled,” said the responsible, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialist units were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently located, the role, the secret officers played and the elements of the Italian special units.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and special units,” he explained without further detail.
He also argued that a ransom had been paid.
Early evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a terrestrial vehicle in a patrol where the kidnappers were killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfur, but the Liberation of the Sudan Unity (SLA-U) movement, which immediately opposes this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and prosecute the harmful sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical places that are hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that can effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros only for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the American’s culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government circles by mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec’s Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 Historical Societies are trying to deal intensively with history, to save a few money the numerous private archives, and to gain the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guardians of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers leave their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten graveyards.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank in turbulence fallen by the U.S. financial crisis want to take their arms: The three states provide the bank and insurance institution, which has also establishments in Hungary, a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level at the weekend, along with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s Competition Authority.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank may have preceding characters.
For the purpose of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states purchase the respective shares of the bank for about 49%.
The bank will probably sell some of its shares, above all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steep valley ride last week, in the second half of the week already recorded serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pleat.
The institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year-old depth.
Since January, the value of shares dropped by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share rates, the group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the $700 billion US rescue package is expensive and the uncertainty in the markets in the valley ride of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the courses have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institute was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested persons with a real offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, he said.
Among the customers there has been no panic until now, the bank’s stores have not been stumbled.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent firms, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the Chickenerstall
Due to the drug consumption of a person in America, life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that in any case couple the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hand, otherwise we trust the chickens on the fuchs" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer’s health status, and if the risk is too highly estimated, the insurance is not completed.
The customer was previously sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in awareness of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more affordable method: Based on the customer’s identification number, he received the last one-and-a-half-year data from the pharmacies, that is, what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates what illness the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducing medications, he could conclude that his blood fat levels are untreatedly high, which would automatically range him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance only needs to do more the paper frame, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer’s view, while those mentioned above are not.
For the inquiry and processing of the data, their own companies have formed themselves, which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although there have been no omissions punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory surveys and combine them with the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is getting more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress that authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard believes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned may hardly be able to prohibit access to his data, since otherwise the insurances will not conclude any contract with him.
Then the chickens are left to the mercy of the fuck.
Global food schedule from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India were both leading trade partners, this was the main topic alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today also takes place the French-Indian Summit, which is discussed mainly about cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic greater power that should be given more votes and rights to talk with international concerns, member states have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was made to double trade over the next five years, i.e. increased to EUR 100 billion.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civilian flight agreements with India have also been legally summarized into an agreement, so that air transport will also be promoted in the future.
By 2009, India will sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The goal is to make a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the number one partner in India, New Delhi is only nine of the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides condemned to the heaviest, and the conference of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides bearing fault on the failure.
The EU emphasized its energy and climate programme, that is, pollutant emissions will be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India, as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Food price rise should also be tackled, and therefore both support the convention of an international conference on financial crisis.
The Indian leader today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is expected to order French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement will be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the rights acquisition.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the trade fair and imagine over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honour guest of the event.
The Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm exhibition room “Punto Italia”.
Then a press conference near the room structure will be followed in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: at this occasion, digits, trends and perspectives about publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but especially in the adult and youth party.
Billionaire Steve Fossett’s Small Aircraft disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett’s small aircraft, who disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the Nevada Desert, was found.
The items have been found on a high plate of 3000 m height, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely destroyed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localised, where a troop was sent. Now we have the certainty that it was the plane with which Steve Fossett fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or closeness.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Road Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a few hours after the plane's view was sent to a team that identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which lost on 3 September 2007 after Fossett in Yerington, Nevada, launched a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of the personal items of Fossett were found in California, near the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home near the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identities named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, when he was the first man to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he travelled the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Among its many records, a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you do not expect
A suv that falls out of the conventional schemes due to its original design and the special line guide, the loading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to introduce new breath to the sector.
Especially due to its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drums, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various fibers that will take over the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form, with 3D glasses that are to be distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car is so apparently out of the poster on which it is pictured.
Then, using the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated at different moments in all its details to combine it as a whole again.
No doubt, Mercedes’ concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of autoclame into this rather stereotype field.
Will it succeed in irritating the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it’s clear who the Italian hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is now embarrassed? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years, and which, honestly, until recently caused no serious problems.
There has never been confrontation with enemy fans until now.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Among these were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was a confrontation with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc provided 144 cards for the game to Italian fans, all of which were issued on behalf of the game and thus easily controlled.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among the trips to Sofia, there was no one with a ongoing stadium prohibition.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, have also been denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stages across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot into a stadium.
Luckily.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitators who could follow this little more than 150.
“This fire must be immediately extinguished, and that in no case gives such a behavior the opportunity to justify,” the Viminal said.
That’s why, “eyes to above all with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce.”
In fact, a small core of the Italian ultras is located in Puglia.
On Tuesday, tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Surveillance) gathers the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services dealing with the problem of stadium force.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (definitely expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
Although it is true, Mazzilli says, it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their deeds.
So far, this group had kept itself in a fence, but now it has to be covered what happened and will happen.
But let’s talk about the pipes during the hymn Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, but let them let me, there is no education.
