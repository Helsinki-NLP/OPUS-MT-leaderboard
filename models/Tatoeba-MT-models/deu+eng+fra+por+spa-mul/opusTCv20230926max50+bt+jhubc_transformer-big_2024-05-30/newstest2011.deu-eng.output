The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorium".
The new heads of the capital from the rows of ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS at the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has a little bit “abclopped” members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious Slang, who has become citizens in recent years in which today’s coalition partners in Prague were at the ruder.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is rejected by some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to which these new terms topped somewhat in the dark.
At least they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm rather a newborn in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "patent-word wealth".
But also Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, the term “golf hole”.
“This is the only expression of those you present me here that I use again and again.”
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published in June before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editor picked out six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go into the conditories", "snake", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleaking".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth – Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague’s schools – promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even decline the hearing.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.
“I don’t care about these things and how the Civil Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge it.”
“It’s important for me as we understand ourselves within our programs,” he said.
As already suggested, in the above mentioned headline, Lukáš Kaucký supposedly did not recognize that the speech of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term “voldemort” says nothing and the only term he correctly wrote during the test was “the biggest Prague golf hole.”
“This is the tunnel Blanka,” says Kaucký, adding to security, “but I know that rather from the newspaper.”
And funnyly, "I'll probably have to have a language course."
The "Golfhole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Board of Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats know, however, for whom the term Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure is to be found and, as it means, "going into the conditorial".
“I think that is going to any Prague gastronomy,” Plachý is quite close to the mystery solution when you know that it’s the headquarters of Janoušek’s companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have taken this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there seems to be no similarly citizen slang among the Social Democrats.
“I asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s really no such thing with us.”
“We call ourselves by name, we also use shortcuts or names again and again,” says Prague’s Chairman of ČSSD Petr Hulínský – salopp called “Hulda” by his fellow parties.
“I was named Bříza at school, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Karel Březina tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Weinert is friendly to the party fellows of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", representative Miroslav Poche, who was aware of himself before the elections by making party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spicenames are the only thing that allows the Social Democrats in the inner-party language use.
Hulínský doesn't like it supposedly when it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another name of the Prague president.
His spice name "Doctor of Rubber Nup Rights" allegedly has to do with Petr Hulínský having acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso typically have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are married and do not have children.
If one of these women is the witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
"Even young and healthy women remain this saved as they help and give birth to work," a sister describes the situation that takes care of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a special home.
The local government now decided to deal with this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he released a brochure to stop the "hexen tracking".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper said "the standard" on the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is gang and exists in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, neighbor country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they overshed with petroleum and just burned them.
This incident was reported by the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would only have been a confrontation of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is flamed, which will be used to ritual ointments.
After the group tried to "drive a bad spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Friends of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to remove the witch hunt, the Gambian President has combined the president himself in the past year.
“President Yahya Jammeh defeated a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt’s death, as this allegedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president even by black magic.”
"He called for help from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's body guard, kidnapped women and men violently from Gambia's villages and brought to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said.
In the farm, the embedded people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrented people did not survive their stay at the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: Although heating in the oven - yet pays higher rental
An older underwritten man just leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Cohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who just spends a prison sentence.
All three were just increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rental, the son is planning to cover next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
“And there’s not even fluent warm water in the apartment and heating you have to be in a simple coal oven,” he tips with his finger angry on the new rent agreement of the son, whose authority he has to sign.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half vote and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenant to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish a guidance on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man only wins off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming the major "Laboratory of Deregulation".
After New Year, this deregulation will prevail to most rental apartments in Czech Republic, whose tenant has not yet paid a market-related rental.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device are with it.
"Lease 2011", a special keyboard on the touch screen lights.
Shortly tipped and the device already splashes a number channel.
Not much we have deciphered the number "157" and already piped it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on the row.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts flatter the most tenant of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a lease increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the writings.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer center has been open since November 18.
“The action is going a little over a week, that is, that’s only the beginning,” the women behind the switch respond after a moment hesitated when the “client” unleashed as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Prior to the elections, Vice-President of Parliament from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek had raised this topic quite loudly by the ČSSD, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"Not even nice, toilet glasses could change them," the man mentioned earlier makes himself air.
So far, the employees say retirees are mainly on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount that promises them to RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
In the benefit of a half-discounted February rental, other tenant will also come to sign the new rental agreement until December 15.
Until now, "Deregulation switch" in Havířov is all else than overloaded by demands.
“Of yesterday’s 360 customers only were about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 because of this,” the Switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites and wallboards where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This should not be a threat, but is to understand as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach,” RPG explains on his websites.
“No one goes here in court,” one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the customer center say at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 left me for food where I should take the money for a court dispute," he said.
Then the employees become uncertain.
"We can't see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign, and so the people are waiting," she says.
The regulated rental ends mostly in Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, tenant increase is an economic need.
“The existing amount of rent is not even sufficient to maintain the residential fund,” argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and – precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants, according to the homeowners, is the main ground for the rise in the tenant.
While RPG could invest four billion in apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling in front of the collar chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, there are always a few bright red information.
"Lease increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means no more than 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it is read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG rent increases by 38%.
“In these cases it’s about raising extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter,” RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rental remains at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not jump the rentals to the height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What more - the company is committed to another commitment: All revenues from the rental increase (see chart) wants the company to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and thermal insulation.
But - primarily, they are to benefit those who sign the agreements on the rise of the lease.
The architects saw - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a mini kindergarten here, with all that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design for last year.
The projection and architecture office Arch.Design, whose ateliers come from a whole series of renowned Brno buildings, expected from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building to the premises for its corporate minor garden.
In a wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is situated in the fact that the projectors and architects will return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the ability to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The engineers and architects are so easier to put their challenging profession and child care under a hat.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to gain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini kindergarten is funded by the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment Policy from the funds of the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic’s State Budget.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were able to be purchased and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the funding is exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is required to continue to operate the mini kindergarten 3 more years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place a year round, with the company provided active assistance in the processing of applications Economy Rating.
To take care of the children wholly qualified staff - a nurse and a child caregiver, the child caregiver can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it comes to a mini-child garden, only five children can be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
Children's garden is flexible to the parents' needs, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the children's garden - without regard to the corporate hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the Mini Children's Garden is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of pre-school.
Children play here not only, especially excellent lessons are offered - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, but they still learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative plays, but also with a computer available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company milieu.
Parents can at any time take a look at the kids and thus avoid stress when picking up the kids from a far away kindergarten.
Therefore, parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-and-employed relationships.
Arch.Design came up with the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees that are family-friendly and through such programs enhance their personal marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi’s interesting people
The roof mouths like the back of a prehistoric axle, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are crushed fish moulders.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes was named "Bone House".
Organic shapes, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, camel split and mosaics, the façades reminding the sparks and all-present soft lines, all of these are typical characteristics for the style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with stunning lines, tender colors and textures that remember nature and living beings.
Only at a closer look, you noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade is even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting reinforces the gloss of the colours.
The same pivot lines and dipped forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rods, ceramic elements of doors, and even looking holes and leaves.
The house Batlló in the neighborhood of Eixample on the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, conducted by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, was initially on the disappearance of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí on an unusual and cheaper renovation.
The rental house Casa Batlló however did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the reality owner’s representative apartment and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
In the design of the façade, however, many other artists and artists also worked with it.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was obtained by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the name "Bonehaus".
Others, in turn, called it a special window opening mechanism because of the "home."
It is also said that at the top of the building was represented the sword of Saint George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other imagery elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the house.
Something bizarre mutes her 45-degree inclination.
In his creation, Gaudí consequently ignored all the construction regulations at the time and did not leave themselves at all.
Although before the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the appropriate construction permit but the information he provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so disturbed by the result they requested a repair at the completion of the city two years later.
The councillors, among other things, also confronted that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public citizenship.
However, changes no longer occurred, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the invitation of the neighborhood to do so, Josep Batlló filed a request to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a company salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was paid to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salons and thus a larger society could conveniently talk without having to renounce some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a quite unusual roof and two more floors, apart from a new façade.
It is also impressive that Gaudí plays with the light as well as the blue and white glazed cages, with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the light halls.
The game of these two colors gives light to all the floors of the house.
He simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was incorporated into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and most beautiful apartment is made open to the public.
The householders only decided to take this step in the year and this from the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to further common and roof rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building memorial is not a pap, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and tourist exhibitions holders receive 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to make friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - i.e. mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmonically in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In choosing many things play a role - the weight, size, health status and not least also the gender of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust are subjected.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattress are not well suited as they need a lot longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattress.
And - they should be used regularly.
Indeed, if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a fixed plate, moisture is stacked: therefore, it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
In the election, of course, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who were abroad for a long time, where very high mattress with soft layer are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
“Happy all ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they no longer can sleep right here.”
"For their sweetened shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a form memory polymer)."
“I also recommend such people with sugar, among other things, who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can poorly receive the ‘informations’ from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczyková, specializing in polish furniture.
That’s why I’ve got many ice hockey players and other customers these mattress with Visco foam (Memory Foam) years ago.
“Today this is no longer a problem because such mattress are offered among others by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico.”
And you don’t need to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite easy.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it regularly melts on the warm body.
Nowhere it presses it, in the night you don’t walk around like after a heavy struggle.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still count the length of the foot soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who are 180 cm long, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm of bed width, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
Comfort for and for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on your back, there should be enough space for the easily angular arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Zunftmaster of the Polsterer and Space Equipment School, who has already been prevailing for years on the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furnies.
With a double bed everyone needs its own roast and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattress are equal high.
Otherwise, nothing remains other than mounting the rod at different heights and this is long not possible for any bed frame.
Foam mattress should be at least 14 cm height, mattress with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine pad.
"With your hand or while sitting, you cannot feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rost type.
Full padded beds with mattress and underground such as siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattress cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed what is already gang and existing today.
And since in a single night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and shut down sieve).
Also therefore, professionals refuse advertising logos, promising a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee in mattress.
Everything has her when and but.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: for mattress of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not scare the hygiene of the washable, removable pads, yet it is recommended to use a mattress sheath that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though today it is usually made of matraces with round zip, so that two halves are obtained after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger matraces, especially performed alone, often as the unparalleled struggle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a rost?
Get out of it!
Or at least for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are already in) and use mattress with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattress do not belong to such a substance.
Latex or sandwich matraces are suitable for non-adjustable latex rods with 14 to 18 spring rods (lamellae) (also possible combinations of latex and coconut), always paying latex with a larger number of latex rods, i.e. from 28 and more spring rods, with lordose support in the lenden spinal range and the ability to regulate the late.
No mattress with spring skeleton include adjustable lamel rods as they do not react to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the ribs of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special attachment of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be printed or even angular so that they allow the punctual lowerness of the sleeper shoulder.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area at "Man mattress".
It is also thought of the ladies - they get these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rost with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitortion spring are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thus reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) head pillow to the right mattress and roast, most benefits are lost again.
Also here is a fist rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm cushion, as Scandinavia likes, for example.
In the side side, the pillow should compensate the shoulder height (along with the shoulder reloading zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress).
Our modern mattress have somewhat common with the former (filled with hood) straw sacks yet.
Modern manufacturers use more and more common natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Even for mattress, the new magic word is "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, for the production of polyurethane foams, it is used more and more commonly natural oils - for example, ricino and soy oil.
Soybean is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the core of materials of purely natural origin for mattress," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also have microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender smell while sleeping.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooler" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattresses can absorb the heat and cool the body, the mattresses have "heating" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers rain the blood circulation, so the weaker gender becomes comfortably warm when sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattress (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Due to the combination of the various sticks (heavy) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattress are created, which know exactly where head, hip and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more.
However, health matraces are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered to be a medical tool.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was awarded this advantage.
You see saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
There are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattress at the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the Tempur material that conducted the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to huge overloads at the launch.
Tempur is soft with heat, in cool environment it reinforces it again.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body’s pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattress but also for other health products, such as for special foot pads to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance equipment to have children under control
The fear of their own children grows, so more and more parents consider monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was initially invented for cars, can place as well as good people, which would be helpful in such cases as recently in the untraced disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently approximately as large as a cigarette box, but soon it might not be larger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror and thus keep them looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that it’s not about herumspionage at all, but to reduce the probability of tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices in the Czech market.
“I agree that it can occur in individual cases to abuse such devices, for example if you put it in your pocket to someone without he knows about it, but we haven’t had any such case before.”
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use them in emergency.
Children’s psychologist Dana Bočková, however, notes that if a child doesn’t wear such a thing, it simply get rid of him.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
“Mobile phones initially awakened great expectations with parents, but they can turn off as easily as these new monitoring devices,” said Bočková.
It is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed.”
"Today it's the phone."
“If such monitoring devices were more widely used, they would also look for them because their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising.”
"In these cases, the police criminals are always a step ahead," the psychologist said.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech, who offers location services for both automobiles and people, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
“The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals.”
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, i.e. when you fall down and stay movingless, the device immediately sends a warning and indicates the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also run smart mobile phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in wood box size that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the danger that you lose it.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, we are therefore testing devices that look like normal digital watches in the present.
“This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he notices that only after a certain time, which gives the police a time forward," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
Therefore, the combination of localization function using the GPS system (as well as the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignitions that you could envelop all of the Czech Republic, but you could last only two years.
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignitions, fired with explosive sets.
In the previous year, the Department of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of lighting line to the army camps.
It is quiet to know that the armed forces have served for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition scissors - two or more than four years.
The army purchased the lighting clutch from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for the Lampian 40 million crowns.
In his reason for the purchase of this immense quantity of ignition line, the MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition line annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians that MF DNES addressed it, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleansing women.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Pisek are not except.
Only in this way could the significant annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignitions be justified half-way.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
However, these army stocks would also be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that every new professional soldier is completely enough to train two meters, then the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases – even in the face of the increased needs of the pioneer and specialist units.
Soldiers complained recently to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handfire weapons, so that shooting exercises were heavily limited for the lack of resources.
Not to mention the shortage of pants.
“I don’t even understand why they buy such a lot of ignitions from us.”
But that’s their decision ultimately, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as a dealer wish to meet largely," says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Department of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of lighting line with the army that would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group only speaks of a four-year period of use of the ignitions and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible," one of them acknowledges, but wants to remain unnamed to not be accused of criticism to the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use expires, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not threaten the life of the soldiers.
These tests are not for free, but cost more money.
Another argument by the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s delivery of 244 kilometers,” spokesman Pejšek told us the position of the Department of Defense.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of ignitions of police pyrotechnicians who liquidate the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brotherhood army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only the amounts of this ammunition that they can consume before the duration of use expires.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases is also open to modern and therefore reliable ignitions.
The Department of Defense has already had huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakia’s People’s Army prepared for their campaign for the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who responded to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignitions that they bought today so "favourable".
To this day, I’ve got the contacts that I’ve won thanks to the competition.
The victorious placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success mutes like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad he became aware that there are no good accommodation options in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank loan he created a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a higher education student in the sixth semester, this was surely a bold business.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits into the house, which he subsequently rebuilt step by step towards the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in only seven years.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
“We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested in the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already signed up,” says the entrepreneur Number One last year.
"Great share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just the victory in the competition "Business of the Year," Pytloun adds recognizing.
The victory brought him greater renownedness, yes, popularity in Liberec and the surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t need to win at the same time, every view is good.
He says he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances to date, which otherwise would not have come to at all.
“With some people I met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relationships until today.”
The success-related glory, according to his opinion, is also a little based on each of his employees.
And there he's at the seventy.
“I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition.”
I really consider this not only as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
“My name is just a little bit in front,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successors a calmer year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its target effort, Farmet has made the worst behind it.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone competition of the year last year, Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury at the time worshipped the efforts with which he stamped a company from the ground from the small tool building in Česká Skalice that makes hundreds of millions of revenues.
“I can say that this value has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition,” the winner says.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state then offered a small workshop for the peace of mind to his father Karel Žaárský as a compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, left his career in the company in which he was until then occupied, saused and founded a company with a few companions of his father to manufacture plastic waves.
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses across Central Europe.
But only due to the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization, it has also entered into the consciousness of the non-faculty.
“Not just that our customers now see the brand Farmet much more intensely, even our foreign partners began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, contributing greater value,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, Farmet was not only in the sign of victory seuphoria.
The assessment declined from the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time even less shake citizens, but above all companies, just reached its highlight - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t get rid of this situation either.”
“Revenues declined by 40%, we had to restrict production and even attack dismissals,” explains Karel Žďárský.
Sometimes a viable company has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation in hand and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower gains, than before the crisis.
In one, the company wasn’t willing to break down - in investment in research and development.
“From the subsidy we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired main awards at domestic exhibitions,” says Žďárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales grow again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish a lot of pleasure in the victory of the new winner – but in a quiet atmosphere,” Karel Žďárský said.
An opinion survey that removes with unsense rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some nonsense rules have already been able to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the duty to create documents on authorities available online.
Therefore, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social insurance administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this changes.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer demand extracts from the trade register in the future in the case of social insurance payers controls," ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová said.
Meaning and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the rules and orders under the lupe, to comply with the entrepreneurs in Czech Republic and to remove the unsense.
This is already for the fourth time this year part of an entrepreneurship competition organized by the economic newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal duties that serve only to hinder corporate activity.
“For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world,” said Karel Havlíček from the Czech Republic’s association of small and medium-sized companies and businessmen.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity is the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic is ranking 74th in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year an eight places worse.
The competition of the year’s absurdity was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic foolishness from April to the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is served. Then the competition organizer is looking for seven candidates for the "anti-price" and leaving the public to vote through the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.nihmed.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives most votes.
For this year’s opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely, 105 meaningless rules and orders have been registered.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finals" of the competition, for example, are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for highways and fast roads or that entrepreneurs have to provide with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The expression of the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening that regularly also participates in personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Republic of Tsch, as well as Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of Tsch, were at the highlight of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneur clutch between the legs, there can be no real economic resurgence, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that today make businessmen more difficult to do their business unnecessary," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unsense arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, the people mostly disturbed the obligation imposed by the entrepreneurs to report to the business office at the location of their permanent facility three days in advance the intention of traveling to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition level.
This obligation has been repealed in accordance with a novel of the Commercial Act.
The duty that received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Office of employees' service travels for up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called Green Card Act.
All good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists was elected to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person balances in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new one in this year’s fifth year of the competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair activities.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, the exclaimer and guarantee of this competition, as well as the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafon competition company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and destroys enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject of their activities, their efforts still have a common designator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, among the fourteen finalists from all Czech Republic, the Prague software company Et Netera, which encourages the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes care of her health-related employees, representing 70% of her employment, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the year, she ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which introduced a flowing and also reduced working hours to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the circumstance that the company purchases primarily with Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in its surroundings, and works on environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to reduce the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment as much as possible,” said Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is in turn based on the health of its employees and therefore has acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic chairs and keyboards, as well as encouraging their home employees and using cartering services provided by a domestic factory.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which provides concrete assistance by the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least, it is also worth noting the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
“We’re giving our employees contributions to food, work, increase their qualifications and holidays,” says Josef Strapáč from the Baufirma Czasch of Bruntál, the winner in the Maharish-Slesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire addressed in the application and sent it to the organizer until August 15th.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the assessment by the organizer.
“If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition ‘Responsible Company of the Year’, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year’s competition they were not disqualified for this reason.”
“A separate registration on this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman from the organizational agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Boden Fund - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrested in the last few days.
In this case, the local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was deducted by detectives in handlebowls.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of claims for restitution in such a way that the plots offered in the competition were a specific interested party.
Luboš G. has paid half a million for it.
“At this point, I can only confirm that the police pursued a person for the crime of fraudulents in a public competition,” said Antonie Zelená, chief of the Pilsner Attorney of the newspaper “Právo”, she could not grant further details in terms of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate about it in view of the scarce official information.
The spokesman of the Ground Fund Lubomír Černá addressed the question of Právo that the police have actually arrested the Ground Fund's Pilsner side office and done so during a public competition.
"It was about a customer and no one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct name "invitation to supply claims for the transfer of land under the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the property offered.
“These persons offer a higher value of their claims to be paid by the transfer than the claimed property value.”
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential purchasers is set, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," the spokesperson explains.
Luboš G. obviously provided information about who had signed up for the request and since he was a legitimate person, as he had purchased a number of refunds, he offered a land interest that he retired from the competition.
Obviously against a fat deduction.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the Ground Fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted by criminal law because he revealed lands in replacement replacements, which had already been made decisions on construction projects.
At the time, Luboš G. purchased from the ground fund, for example, lands designed to build public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access magistral was planned to the commercial area Borské pole.
Later he exchanged this very conveniently with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
The town hall had to give a small heavy heart to not threaten the construction project by blocking the land.
The residential costs of the households rise by a few hundred a month
The households have to expect not only higher costs for all kinds of energy from January, but also higher water and waste charges and for remote heating and somewhere rent grow.
As of January, families will have to draw more of hundreds of crowns from the wallet monthly than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water deliveries, and somewhere remote heating deliveries will also be defeated.
The electricity control alone costs a few hundred more crowns annually.
Strong current prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is a fault to promote the power generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Therefore, there are a few hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are getting expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for distance heating are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns monthly for remote heating from January, more than 1000 crowns per year pay families in Liberec.
In turn, the residents of Prague threaten 9% higher water and waste charges, in case the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8%.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to all Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are now one of the highest, water and waste charges are expected to rise by 7.4%.
Enormous rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rental regulation falls away.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rentals by 100 percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this tenant increase, the company wishes to ask it in court.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drunk with remote and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Far, Rum and Wodka, exceptionally also a good whisky you stole the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after their enjoyment, drunk Czech teens under fifteen have to be treated most often.
No exception is children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is based on the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of the child departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to get drunk.”
“Today’s trend is clearly hard alcohol,” said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the child’s department at Horovice Medical Bohemian Clinic.
Whisky, if it is possible to remove the father a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least far or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," the chief doctor explains.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinova gives him right.
"Most often it's about remote or rum."
“This is today’s alcohol trend, especially at basic schools.”
"It was also about Slibowitz, to be taken from home," Mrs. Jurinova said.
According to chief doctor Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital have long been no exception.
Before the clinic in Horovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and remote.
“A girl had to be hospitalized four times.”
“She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first inserted with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and in combination with ‘extase’,” the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party."
“The interesting thing was that her mother didn’t even come strange that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief physician asked.
Precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when boosting with their own sprays is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, to real dependence in the true sense of the word, it is not possible for children.
Under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all associated phenomena and that is not the case with these children.
In those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to the spokesman of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinova, about forty drunk children were inserted into the local child and youth medicine department until mid-November.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning that required a hospital stay enter the statistics.
Drink children brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drunk a bottle of snaps in the school bank, there are three seasonal amplitudes, which are 100 percent leaving: Walpurgis night, New Year and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for sorrow because of poor testimony or for pleasure on holidays."
“In Walpurgis’ night I have experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording,” says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under physician supervision is paradoxally better than a child who only fights with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning afterwards arising from dehydration and glucose deficiency can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
“They’re clearly better, because after the ‘great’ experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without anything hurting anywhere.”
“They are just a little confused about where they are,” says Dr. Pelikán, at least sometimes destroying the patient’s good mood by counting them the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed comes well and enjoys a few hundred thousand crowns.
"I used this as an educational means once again when I directly expected the children at the visits what cost their drunkness and that it can happen that they have to work once the entire holidays to earn money for a single feet," said Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health cash does not take on return procedures to require the costs necessary for healing of drunk children from the parents.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the transportation aircraft Casa C-295M, were flying to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
This is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen abroad at mannews or flight shows.
This is about the airable two-seat version L-159T1, operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are still preserved at Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
When she physically ships the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Department of Defense, is not yet known.
The single-seated fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, were separated from long-term deposited aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry’s resort.
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," Pejšek told the newspaper Pravo.
He added that the army will not have to leave without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Department of Defense in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody signed a 200-million treaty on the rebuilding of four overflow L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second plane wants to take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to implementing the fighter aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clearly indicated that the company EADS is the customer of the aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to serve to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It's therefore the customer's matter in how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 to a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense had no tenders at the time for purchasing, but spoke directly to EADS.
The Defense Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she only used 24, the rest wanted to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have a judicial resumption.
The European Commission has accused the Czech Department of Defence at the European Court of Justice, and the reason it should have chosen the planes on the basis of a full-European tender and not by answering a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one is to land within fourteen days at Airport Kbely.
A longer display finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose indication finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of cancer in prostate.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, Mrs. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the display finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those whose ring and display fingers were equal.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk declined by 33 percent, in men to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form in prenatal age, evidently reflects the different levels of gender hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer display finger.
Previous research found that just testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was flyingly known to him, nevertheless he considers the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to date has not been "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like the majority of Europe, Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways lies mostly trapped snow, the winter service providers were in many places on the axis all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is locked by some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 towards Prague is "stated".
This said Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Automotive Club (ÚAMK).
At 91 miles a truck collapsed, at 93 miles two trucks collapsed, and there are injured in this accident.
A few cars are also in the street graves.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the motorway D1 towards Prague.
There were also two trucks.
The drivers should go behind Brno at 190 kilometres or drive over Brno and ride to the place of Kyvalka at 182 kilometres.
Indeed, there forms kilometers of stakes.
Also on the D11, an accident happened and that happened right away on the journey to Prague.
In Prague itself, a snow cover is several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, autocolons are formed in the city rail of Prosek, even the Štěrboholská street is completely shut down.
The safest means of transport is certainly the metro.
The trams drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis stab meets.
There are also problems on the railway and on the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow injuries.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague — Kralupy or also on Prague — Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně is closed from Wednesday at 11am to 5pm in the morning.
Most roads in Southern Morocco can only be carried out with increased caution.
To Vyškov, three side roads are completely inadmissible, in the surroundings of Brno snowfalls are formed, and in the surroundings of Blansko, you are forced to use snow freshes on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vyškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here you will also have to use snow-cleaning snow frozens.
When it can be driven again, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the region of Hodonín, caution is required in the field of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be spread for natural protection reasons with inert scatters, lies up to five inches of thick snow, ČTK led.
In Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of snow fell, mostly in Northern Bohemia, at a position of up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mahrisch-Slesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow dropped.
In Czech Republic, slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent" weapon.
The U.S. troops have first used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is only known so far under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban and displace the force ratio in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate canon.
Indeed, their projectiles are driven to the target by laser with a meeting safety of just a few meters.
The special arrows of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and contain high explosive explosives, work practically like small granates.
The guns can be programmed so that they can explode not only on the target when they hit, but at any point of their ballistic pathway.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the gun grave.
Indeed, it is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of fight.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighter gun is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
“The soldier basically goes like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise viewing point after which he corrects the rise angle, then he just needs to press.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 meters."
"When you depress, the gun loads up and shoots the gun to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are moved
Fujitsu Group moves its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in Astro Park.
Fujitsu is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer and maintenance industry giant on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg in July next year in Astro Park, which is a large office complex at Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt district Niederrad.
Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park would be better to meet the employee’s way of working.
Fujitsu was only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
Responsible Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, “with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The latest movement of a major company within the region brought pleasure to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Economics Officer Markus Frank (CDU) said that a global player was won again.
This is a “great location recognition.”
Fujitsu pass to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for lower wheel.
Bad Homburger mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not have changed space with the computer manufacturer’s difficulties with the real estate owner on the Marienbader.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have given the outbreak.
Now it’s about to prevent a long empty stand in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and rent of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu's house at the town hallplatz and the neighbouring "small vertical" with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader Square belonged to one of the most controversial building projects in the Kurstadt 10 years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city gateway was created between the railway station and the town hall that criticized both the massive construction of the areas used previously as a parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, referred to the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu conucer in Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers, and also provides the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine-Main Area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees counts Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is engaged in Frankfurt-Lower-Rad, with other subsidiary companies on this site to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, Astro Park has been rented 7000 square meters in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped baseline - has its headquarters, among other things, of the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depes.
Wikileaks founder Assange is alleged to remain in England.
The Wikileaks Disclosure Platform is increasingly under shooting in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and now search for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s lists, is expected to stay in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks driven from Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the country of the outdoors," the unveiling activists said on Wednesday (local time) on Twitter.
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had accessed the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depens to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
Wikileaks said, “Prima – our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “you should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees had employed research, the television station reported CNN, calling on Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“I would have wanted Amazon to take this action earlier in view of previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman called on the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immense and respectless action puts our national security at stake and threatens life around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape by Sweden’s authorities, is on Interpol’s list.
According to a report from the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in the UK remains known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as an intriguing of its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be charged and executed for betrayed.
In Canada, a consultant of Chief Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, then, a blow exchange was burned.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently known spying calls to diplomats.
“I’m not sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website.”
The U.S. government now puts the protection of its databases on the test stand.
Russell Travers was appointed as a special representative, the Vice-Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Actions, said the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways the entire government exchange and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that they want to take care of the safety of dissidents and the most active if they are endangered by the Wikileaks release.
“We’ve done everything to get in touch with them,” foreign office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice-conditioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatier and from the gelataio.
The gelatier, in Germany somewhat ancient to the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the cooler, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to travel to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he doesn’t come past the “Gelato University” of Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-university has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are several-day specialty courses around chocolate ice and internships in the home ice dial.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare to the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents – from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate advisor and after years wants to insert something of his own in a nerve-retardant job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice dial in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiers Luciano Ferrari initially explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, doesn’t forget the crab of the national and southern overlay: “Italian gelato is just the best – and then there is still a lot of romance.”
The first step towards manufacturing seems quite easy.
Luciano kips the basic ingredients of milk, crane, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats all to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cooles to four degrees.
Then it turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice types.
The teacher is immediately disturbed with questions: Can you only make ice cream with natural fabrics without stabilizer?
How to let your own experimental lust run free?
Luciano warns not to be misleaded by the time spirit.
Those who speak of ice cream "only natural ingredients" may have still used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as garlic flour from the garlic bean.
Of course, you can make ice even without stabilizer, only then it needs to be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“Suppliers will all try to turn dozens of flavored additives to you.”
“But you should just try.”
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white basic mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate feading.
Now students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes it four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnuts ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aromas or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice varieties.
More aroma materials, more fruit puree - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste more nudic when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a gelato properly, says Luciano.
Ice creation is a computational task: If it is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra proportion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners thus measure the oaksles in the grape most).
Luckily, tables facilitate the calculation.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device to automatically manufacture the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously beaten creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Notwithstanding all automation, small pains don’t remain out of.
The Brazilian Gustavo clings and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as the overdimensional stick mixer goes out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time until something like that happens.”
Controllers in the light
The European Food Authority Efsa was undermined by the experimenting industry with gene plants.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent Institute for Impact Assessment of Biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The leader of the Efsa Group for Genetic Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another efsa expert have been contracted for years in the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked significantly with the Efsa test regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The EFSA rules are equal to the Ilsi position papers and thus deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is intended to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has a conflict of interest.
Thus, be a high-level Efsa manager recently without requirements or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus switched the sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Environmental Federation as well as the EU Parliamentarian brilliant.
However, the efsa cannot recognize conflict of interest.
Recognize all serious data, including industry data, as long as they are of high technical quality, a statement said.
Of the experts working for Efsa, you don’t want to have no contact with the industry.
But you should disclose them.
Kuiper is awarding his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This refers itself to a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobby order.
Independent experts such as then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempt in animals and the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified corn makes on the field, for example," then says.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not give reliable results.
“If you do not seek the risks, how can you find them?” he asks then accusing.
That’s how Angelika Hilbeck looks.
The scientist has been researching in genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field as in the United States.
There are hardly any researchers who are not connected with groups.
Critical studies would usually not be published for companies.
“The industry controls safety research,” says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about 400 pounds.
On Monday night he stood in front of Stuttgart railway station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snow.
The story is known: in September, the excavators had begun to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: hundreds of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-heavy depth laying of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, was built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the pieces.
“These stones are relics.”
"You shouldn't go away."
"A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw an one, he rocked to cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the breaks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart Stones track leads to a forest at Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought everyone who went to Stuttgart during his absence.
"It would be a shame they would be ground or disappear in the depony," he says in his office, a wood girl who once was a watchhouse.
In September, he told him that he bought the remains of the Northern Wings from the demolition entrepreneur.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn’t do anything for the dismissal.
And when it happens, then it is the most reasonable thing if the stones were continued to use.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the quaders heavy on average 80 kilograms, a single price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 big truck loads.
About half are still in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owner, landscape gardeners, Hauslebauer.
They came from everywhere and had taken away what the bag room and trailer could have been wearing.
The Stuttgart stones of the stumbling have long been transformed into “mairs” or limited to herbal beets.
“This stone is actually nothing special,” says Rongen.
"Is not the political component."
He climbs into his ground car, making a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
He studied and discontinued, later biological, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all Germany, he gathers his treasures.
He says he is the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's breaking.
In the snow are artfully cut sandstone.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he blacks.
"My favorite stone."
The way goes up through the forest.
He shows on a bunch: red sandstone, earlier part of the Karlsruhe station.
And then.
"Beautiful travertin."
Once the quaders belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Wherever in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidency, red granite from Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what trouble, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were cut by hand before and moved with simple bottle trains and oxy carriages, he becomes very frightening.
“It would be a scandal if you’d beat something like that.”
He hasn’t become rich, he hasn’t become rich.
But 14 people today employ the stone dealers, as well as stonemetze, an sculptor, a smoke, a glass blower and a gardenmaker have settled up in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” the remaining valuer says.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved there too.
Talent fighting a high-potentials
There is a ruler of Andrang at the buffet.
16 students press around sausage browns, tomato soup and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea competition, they are intended to get to know with VW developers about the car of the future – and Volkswagen.
In the competition about the smartest minds, many companies now go into the near-fight and, like VW, put on cooperation with universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the hearing halls as early as possible before coming to the labour market and being recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish positions about the achievements of their students, you try to look at the exceptional talents in practice projects and bond themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company advocates about the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball pens, rubber pens and maps with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the groups.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, says Selle, are not unusual.
It is new to be so offensive for the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The struggle for the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Rather, they have to prize themselves, especially for highly qualified workers.
Above all, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering offices remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gaps will grow even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes complex recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company so through the United States next year.
Besides, participants can watch KPMG filials and get to know the company.
Whoever may with you decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the cream of the many applicants flys to the United States.
The guns, according to Dykta, are increasingly increasing when they have the high potential at the universities.
“We want to get out of the mass with the race.”
“A simple sailworm was too little for us.”
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be invoiced.
"We have been in touch with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just in front of their graduation and will soon apply to us," he says.
In addition to the direct commonhood at the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also classic at professional trade fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to reach graduates on trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff manager of Solar Engineering manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Snake knows about childhood problems.
Currently, 35 jobs are registered on the company website.
“It’s very difficult to occupy vacancy positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is contacting the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
“The professors give evidence that you can do internships with us or write your diploma.”
Tear promotions are not required by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“This can’t often offer a large group,” says Stübe.
Money hasn’t been playing the main role in job search for a long time ago.
Flexible working hours, child care or good rise opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study at the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff Manager Stübe is also hoping for the placement of the job seekers.
“I think candidates are looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Krieger, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding, namely employer brand education within your own employment.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you handle your people well and identify themselves with the company, they would advertise for their employer with friends and acquaintances alone.
“This is like a game with bands,” Krieger says.
Obama stops new oil drillings
Off the coast of the U.S. state Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drillings in the coming years.
A prohibition has passed the government in Washington - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drillings are prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said this on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill platform in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on the pressure of the opposition and industry.
The supporters therefore want to reduce the dependence of the U.S. on oil deliveries from abroad.
Anyone who carries the responsibility for the devastating oil pest in the Gulf is not finally cleared until now.
The British energy company BP is at the center of criticism, which faces billions of demands.
An investigative commission on behalf of Obama is expected to present its results throughout December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar removed the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately filed applications for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which has been deceived after numerous allegations of corruption, is fundamentally reformed.
Parallel to this, Obama announced to close lucrative tax holes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry,” the result of a current industry survey by the advisory firm BDO – still before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be pushed up until further - the charge of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gasoline: billions of litres of exhausted raw oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling.
Celestine Akpobari says it is good.
"Don't get off," the ecoactivist calms the journalists: "You will get enough oil mushroom before the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to remove a boy wating up to the breast with the surrounding of him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It cannot be seen that under the surface floats brown raw oil sweats.
Earlier she had collected garneles here, Esther Badom tells on the shores of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the tiny flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, from a born pipeline, a lot of crude oil came into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to run six hours to reach fishing waters: the Ogoniland in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the worst regions in the world.
On the ride through the river runs, the entire extent of destruction becomes evident.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat whills brown bull, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oil fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like black lacrystal sticks, sadly leaving palm trees attached singlely hanging their wedles.
As they are otherwise common in wetlands, one seeks nothing: as soon as the outborder silences, it spreads in the earlier paradise quiet riding like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered into, here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, where the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993 because it became dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is refused to return to Ogoniland: While from the entire delta region of Switzerland’s threefold size with more than 5,000 drill sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines daily are pumped more than two million fats of black gold, the Ogoniland oil fields are broken, the group is too unstable.
All a few hundred meters of steel stains like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the holes too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of which are corroded to Mark.
Repeatedly, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then rin a constant stream of raw oil into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have fled into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: annually the amount of oil, as the Supertanker’s “Exxon Valdez” had brought into the sea 21 years ago, one of the biggest environmental disasters in humanity’s history.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be disputed about it.
During the Shell Group’s sabotage and organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main causer.
Shell placed much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner claimed to the 2008 group: Only the rate of defects in the lines is “multi-foldly higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-cleaning workshop under the open sky, they dive from the mangroves shapes: they are splitternacked and oil-cleaning up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected to tubes, sometimes arbitrarily dispersed on the ground, a fire flakes: an illegal small refinery.
The raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, Michael, the head of the group, explains.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the capture pot, later throws out at the end of the line kerosin and eventually diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter diesel barrels daily: "This brings about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undertake the ridiculously low price of almost 40 euro cent per liter of diesel: because they get their raw materials for free.
It comes from “bunkers” who pipe the pipeline network through Ogoniland: Thus, experts say that the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout Niger Delta daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the raw material intermediate is illegal: the lion’s share is filling organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tank ships and destroying it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more owed to the movements of the population or to the lax production method, the activist considers Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies would not perceive them as invaders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's life base, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refinery."
Meanwhile, the ratio of the Ogonis to Shell has been destroyed so much that only one deduction from the group would be questioned: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are better.”
Michael's getting nervous.
"Most of the time you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
“Every minute the soldiers can come.”
If the illegal oil reedlers are captured by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not threaten to be arrested, but probably a painful lubricating money.
The soldiers who are primarily from the country’s northern country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 motors
The A380 seems to have a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of a landing machine that could lead to a "catastrophic drive failure".
The Qantas airline will now sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus in early November appeared to have much more luck than known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major safety problem in their investigations with the drives of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: with an oil hose connection it could generate fatigue and leaks, ATSB’s opinion published on Thursday said.
This could have led to "a catastrophic drive failure".
Rolls-Royce produced drives were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Qantas airbus, which had to notland in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the UK turbine manufacturer.
She filed a prosecution to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows it to further legal measures against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline will demand damage for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the carrier surfaces had damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil burn as a cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 drives worldwide need to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected drives.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATBS spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all the affected persons.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa switched the drive at an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many streets there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
In car accidents at least three people were killed.
The winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures almost the entire republic is snowned at night on Thursday, which leads to chaos of traffic in many places.
In the north and east, there are 15 centimeters of thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is strongly restricted.
On the A7 in Flensburg, winter service was in permanent use, but it was not finished with the constantly newly awakened snow.
Furthermore, heavy boats were over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting storm floods from the morning at the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holsteins, with water stands of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow inflation on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather-central Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxony Switzerland, alarm level was purple – the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds caused decays.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police officials reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to staggering traffic and storm.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disorders in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bayern.
Snow on the railways, removed trees on the railways or destroyed upper lines and softness are the main problems.
In Saxony, remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop his trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool ceilings, food and drinks in the train by firefighters and rescuers.
Snow winds over the streets.
At large German airports, the snowwind leads to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have been removed, according to a Fraport spokesman.
Winter service is continuously used.
Although only a few beaten passengers were at the airport, they still have nearly 400 field beds ready for them.
On many streets there were accidents already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed by a train on a train transition to East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg there came a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: Also here a truck was captured on a train transition because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
In the train, four passengers were injured – the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after surrounding her car at Aschaffenburg on a smoother street.
But the meteorologists have a good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore roars up with light butterflies.
But the wind will be weakened.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
Just the Deutsche Bank has made its group seat beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt Bank District have been modernized; now the bankers have been allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to remove the costs of the renovation - and seeks a buyer for the two high houses, as the Financial Times Germany writes, calling for a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale did not call the spokesman.
“We always check whether it’s more useful to own or sell real estate ourselves and then rent it back,” he said.
This means that Germany’s largest credit institution will return its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors of a household fund and subsequently efficiency-based rehabilitation.
The energetic reconstruction swallowed the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper’s towers now called “green towers” to approximately 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, they are currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands grieve for the dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the swollen miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be saved because the security situation in the struggle is still more precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a heavy explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mining workers aged 17 to 62 were laid down under days.
A probe had been dropped down into the struggle, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of poisonous gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to drop down for safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the fellow.
The bodies could not be saved yet.
Now family members and friends remember the dead with a memory party.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island at a bright sunshine.
They silenced for two minutes.
In honor of the cast miners, there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps, and the names of the friends were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surf boards, also found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags were semi-masted.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the Earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told memory participants.
“But they never came home.”
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the family of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial party.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also poured out.
Rescue workers began to turn off a fire inside the coal mine on the Southern Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are dissipated, it will begin to cool down the bright temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit to the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-lots with his fighter epo "Walhallla Rising" old genre boundaries.
Which audience might think of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when he turned "Walhallla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his punishers and ranks his opponents with almost over-human forces - it sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero loves to serve a rabies killing methods, and his enemies already runs out of living genderness.
On the other hand, Eingage says, as it is actually called, that the whole movie is no word, and also the other characters can be broken up at least one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it will be swallowed and swallowed in the grossly beautiful hilllands of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the scenery of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Happy if a movie has multiple target groups, it is only a shame if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humour or a little less brutality.
Most of the artistic cinema friends are likely to be disturbed from the brain mass that sprays around and the germs.
The action fans die at the latest from boredom, when an eye-off with a troop of violent Christian missionaries, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up via ship to Jerusalem and arrests an eternity in flaw and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to silence there.
So no wonder that "Walhallla Rising" did not find a movie rental in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a jammer because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood tripping facade is hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has deserved some attention.
In this movie it is not about dialogues or a strict act, it is all atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack slowly towards the neck, especially with the unbelievable hatred that hits him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands faithfully to the side of the eye preserves something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, but who becomes enemies and temporarily allies at some point becoming a warrior from hell, perhaps a ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are destroyed.
"Walhallla Rising" is a mysterious movie that you can hate and admire, to angry, excite and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a point of view - it also allows controls.
At midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that leaves the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, which is also the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, would be well suited to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were made.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifty is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with uncharved satellite images.
Per computer animation, she blended where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also introduced photos that show the building from the nearby or even the interior.
The reactor stood shortly before the launch, it said, but was not yet equipped with combustion rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than then, yes, the mysteries became rather larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly seen evidence that there was an active nuclear weapons program in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only talking about an "ambitious reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as is the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat in the summer replied only to lapidar, which IAEA has “sufficient material to ask questions.”
The ruin of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians, although hastened, made aside and planned the ground thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found in Uran's el-Kibar traces that had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which might be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to never run a secret nuclear program or to build a reactor.
The Uran is from the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, after the analysis of the particles, the IAEA was unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses controllers to have a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also silences iron.
“We will never comment on this,” recently reaffirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has resulted in no result since June 2008 and “develops increasingly into a serious problem of credibility for the authority,” as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, eventually a serious violation of the nuclear-arm-blocking contract is in the space, over which the IAEA awakens.
As a key to progress in enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and otherwise still exist.
In this case, the inspectors have not yet revealed what facilities it is, what function it has or what it seems suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are called internally at the IAEA as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely to be one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - precisely with this reasoning, IAEA refuses Syria to access the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be submitted by the US to check out military facilities.
Because nuclear investigators had been aware of the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material were transported back and back.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production”.
However, there are “no indications of sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment or reworking; processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, there are plausible assumptions on these central issues.
It is also unclear whether ruins that could get valuable traces were stored in the three places.
As thousands of trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the decay has remained.
The saltmine al-Tibni, which investigated Syria in 1998 as a radioactive garbage camp, is considered unlikely to be a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, pictures from the orbit show that Syria made earthwork in the three suspected places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This can be accidental, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months after developing a plan for inspections that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - alone shows how much the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also dismissed this proposal.
Having western diplomats in Vienna relieved that the reactor was destroyed a year ago, therefore, the matter did not have a high urgency, about U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has brought into the game for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to implement controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I am open in the future,” but he still hesitated.
There is a high risk in this way: for the first part, a majority in the IAEA Governor Board needs, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than calling on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they do not find anything at the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her still nameless debut in the summer, there is trouble.
The script was written by herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don’t know about it, but that’s enough for trouble.
The woman, a Muslim woman, is in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s associations have immediately protested, afterwards some days of rotation planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in a short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UNHCR refugee aid and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
Diplomatically, she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee aid, her organization has recommended to release Jolie as a ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, after a few times granted a rotary permission for Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie did not then come.
The young author himself says she does not follow political intentions with her film, has engaged in the Yugoslav conflict with much effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
Thus, a second synopsis of the movie on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew themselves in it before the outbreak of war and meet again, when a Bosnian Muslim is taken into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant "rape victims are bound in torture".
That Jolie’s movie actually starts before the war – so much is sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, as so many previously, illegally on the net.
Nothing like going away from here
That evening it's going to be round again for the Irish people.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans jollyed with joy with crying loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub beats in Southern Cork because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cup - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro Siegpremies plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this grilled drinking game and the retardant computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, diverting from the drilling question what will bring the future.
On his plan, he is not playing in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
“I have a mulky feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I still have no work there.”
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her desire job as a event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor perspectives at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already searched for their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as a IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irelands are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are expecting 200,000 migrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of immigration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise, which brought great prosperity for the Ireland, now again becomes sad.
The economic crisis uncertains, above all, the young, well-trained Irelands, for whom it was only up to date.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was abundant.
Three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are reader letters of young migrants complaining: "All goes down the stream in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation.”
“The last one, please, turns out the light.”
Jura-student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future, because the government only pursues eye-washing and no longer offers young people future prospects.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She watches how her companions hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate itself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively occupy the topic.
McLarnon organizes the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair offering a full service on work abroad.
“For professional beginners, however, working abroad is a great opportunity to make the first steps in the career leadership,” the manager says.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just draw up a fashion house.
In January, we continue to go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His homeland now sees O'Donovan rarely because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, when he goes over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m as good as I’m never again.”
He laughs slightly and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained pregartens, parking in the entrances large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros – 100 percent loan funding.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea after and says, "I don't have children I have to eat through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The building engineer does not like the mourning he hears often.
"No one has to be hungry - our situation is far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while, that’s not the worst thing that can happen – perhaps we’ll feel as Ireland.”
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite easy.”
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let’s open the future and just look at how it’s going on with life elsewhere.
He has been working in London for a few years, and why shouldn’t he run well in New Zealand for himself and his girlfriend?
But one thing is still concerned about him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He fears it might be in a life-good party.
"Don't blood too many emotions," he says and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Well, it sounds frightening."
“Let’s rather call it a wandering party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as well as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly in the September and October survey of this year.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by approximately 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, such a trend has been recognized.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents explained that they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% rely on the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined the efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the World Economic Crisis may be because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week increased only slightly in 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America and dropped again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the disappearing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violence crimes increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a bigger problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The growing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents on the overregional basis indicated that the private economy is essential for development, while in 2007 it was 56% (see Diagram 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalize many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with this role assuming in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A voting slap
No one had expected the elections in Haiti to be perfect on November 28.
But the facts far overcome the fears of the electoral helpers who urged to help the mounted country.
Overfill voting urns, multiple votes, voting notes in the Rinnstein, destroyed voting sites and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Elections opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the earthquake in January, stripped around looking for a choice.
Some finally give up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded the revocation of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were partly violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, referred to the election as “very well in many matters.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, as serious as they may be, make the process not necessarily invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, who is allegedly committed to the unpopular disappearing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on December 7th.
The expected selection is available for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jew Celestin, who finds little or no approval among the voters, declares from the electoral authority the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small participation in elections was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organization.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, approximately 250,000 IDs needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after her husband’s sudden death, the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that increased her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether she helps this to a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently mourning Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who even after his wife's election directed economic policy, often introduced budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend extra income on their own.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further confusion.
Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which one parliamentarian struck to another face and others accused the government of kidnapping) Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
“I’m not going to talk about it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now applies for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on their own.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from trade unions - are driving the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty fighting its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scattered the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and People's Countration INDEC, which then beautifully shared the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high global market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join Argentina financially back to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the country’s former redebt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to urge an agreement with the Paris Club donors to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churchers had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
However, last month Economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide technical support in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step towards cleaning the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs support for the middle class, which has largely enough of churchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of the sympathy encountered them will be abominated.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she silently and quietly lifts up many political decisions of her husband.
Weak Applause for China
Taiwan voters slowly approach a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters entitled to vote for mayors and councils in the five city districts, are considered a broad rating of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building basic business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relationships with the mainland, and his policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only little.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supported Taiwan’s greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would mean problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time the DPP even moved to the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the usual occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crawl makers, flag-swing mass movements and only shortly dressed dancers.
There was even a mysterious attempt to murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the KMT honour chairman, held a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a surrounding viewer was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill links or join a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has impaired the election and pushed the DPP into a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relationships with the mainland were not themed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans on social housing and job creation.
The Taiwans love their real independence and refuse China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus its relationships with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also missed too much to spin the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on his own, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwans endorse their China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment safety and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is rather waiting until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was strongly weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison because of corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he committed to absolute independence.
However, under Tai’s governance, a new generation of politicians developed and the DPP struggled for the votes of professionals and youth.
Tsai had great approval as the presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans to forge ideas as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offered a "confidential alternative" to Mas quick approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he stated that the DPP candidates had done better to persist in Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the Pragmaticist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP is difficult to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment, and the increasing sharks between poor and rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only restricted to supporting a reapproach.
At the same time, most Taiwans see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no return anymore.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomers of the Year
If you appear upon a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take part at the 2009 Nobel Prize Award ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was overwhelmingly nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the Year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since its 2008 album Esperanza in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual, but it meets the Grammy rules under which an artist has been allowed to publish up to three albums in the broad public before release of the album.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her sophisticated voice and a good sense for pop, radio and latin music, you can quietly compare spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination spaldings comes closest.
In addition, the Vijay Iyer Trios album "Historicity" was nominated in the category Instrumental Albums, and this favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors of Iyers include “Moody 4B” by experienced saxophonist James Moody and “Positootly” by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO’s “Treme”, was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where otherwise albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more popular.
The secret society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big group category, thus he draws up against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his oktet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandlea.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestras with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles philharmonics and released in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman has also been nominated for his mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year, five artists were nominated in the category of classic producers – Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and VogySacals
In the opera category, mountains were "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shlidrins National "The Enchanted Wander" from the Orchestral.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassonately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was first recorded and recorded on January 4 at the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonicians under the guidance of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil-magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in jail in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the category orchestral performance for the recording of Strawinski’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the Organist Paul Jacobs, Julia Fischer, and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental solists.
This year only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie from Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic Crossover category, Sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains approval from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critics claimed the project to promote both terrorism and transportation.
However, according to a statement by the Commission from Wednesday night, the new Religion Center corresponds to local provisions and will become an aesthetic eye capture.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahai, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice reigns."
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being rather uniformly distributed according to Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no longer America,” said a commentary.
“It’s another planet of the monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand.”
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
Its community with about 135 families has lived peacefully for years in the Riverside County, but they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they have rented together with a manufacturer of water filter plants.
The new, approximately 2,300 square square Mediterranean mosque is expected to have two minarets and will be approximately 13 m high.
It is expected to be created on about 17,500 m2 plot on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the City Council to the project.
Arsenal-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria, which can live from Arsenal, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacteria here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that a life is possible even without the elements that are considered to be essential to life.
“This body has two possibilities.”
"He needs either phosphorus or arsena to grow."
“This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
Six main elements have so far been considered essential – carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacteria grows further in the Californian Mono Lake even if it replaces phosphorus with arsene.
“There is what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the Arizona State University report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced on the discovery, gave a widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
“The discovery shows that organisms can start biochemical processes in other planet systems with the help of other elements and that the ‘standard elements’ that we believe are absolutely necessary are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Science Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockel added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Because arsenal and phosphorus were chemically similar, they assumed that microbes, both exposed, may be able to replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of the arsenal is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus.”
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenal works differently than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it almost blends everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers set out the GFAJ-1 bacterium with an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but can survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no functioning example yet.
Arsenal occurred more frequently in early early early years, she says, so science is assumed that early life forms have used it.
“This gives reason to assume that life may have developed differently than in early early early ages,” said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Remaining stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday as unknown stealed the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, the authorities say.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well-known,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They have been returned to their legal owners.”
Whitmore did not provide any details about the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
“We don’t want to say anymore,” Whitmore explains.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs in reception on Wednesday afternoon at a district home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the cart and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old rude, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were uninjured.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, stayed missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek reported by the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple of dog watching to dog watching.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs – a boxer-wife, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany – with in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis remained in the carriage because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m. as stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis a finding wage, and the animals were implanted microchips to identify.
On Thursday, it was not determined whether a finding wage is paid.
The Lion Rugged Again After Court Approval of MGM Restructuring
After 18-month turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally gained green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday blessed the “prepared” glossy plan to cut the debt of $5 billion and build the way to the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. concurrence law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is nothing more in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
Chapter 11 actually comes into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to fund new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank runs the company for $75 million, which is expected to be funded until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to investment bank Moelis & Co, the company’s management, who struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve the MGM’s financial agents and pay for more than 140 glaciers from the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., who already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid a monthly $375,000 for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to reprise production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond of $265 million to $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be created under Peter Jackson’s director.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose biggest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys Keeps Your Gift Budget in Balance
This year’s favorite is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can throw a significant hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring ropes or about 48 doses play doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moores' law entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, you can find the most famous of this kind, webkinz and Club Penguin, a broader offer.
There are increasingly more button cell-driven toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us are.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plug figures as large as sea pigs singing a note when pushing on their belly.
Once press a note corresponds, by pressing multiple times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Caution: If you started pressing once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60) is the best choice for children from 2).
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchange games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can make a car ride to a class hour, with a better-wisher with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t like to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained therein are not as teaching as the games on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, bright screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassets.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a wood box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about bringing together the blocks to words before the time goes out. It is great for an improvised bookstab competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after offering, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children aged 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
These can be roll shoes or a puffle coat.
The latest head cells-driven microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The cage moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a clown garden.
And he keeps a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become gentiler
As an education officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and commanded with military authority and suppressed voice.
He wanted his feminine members of Chengguan – China’s robust guards of urban order – to be afraid and despised for their arbitrary races and their tension towards violence – to impress the viewers.
"Stand right!"
"Blick straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are so!"
Four girls, barely growing from the teenager age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood straight.
Four pair of black pumps were in straight line.
Four ordinary hats were perfectly sitting on the hair held with blue-white striped.
"For me they look average," Mr. Tang notes poorly.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to remove the image of China’s city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-stars: in 2009, 50 officials reported that a non-properly installed imbessible car looked at the operator until it packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to basically change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the city police strips, and they have been selected specially due to their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly manage to improve the bad picture the Chinese have from these city commanders.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce urban laws only with fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei struck a spectator to death when he filmed them with his phone as they struck a protest against a garbage.
Last year, a training guide from Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on road traffickers.
"Chengguan is anxious to the government," China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper required a “really thorough cleansing.”
Skepticians have the current approach for significantly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News raised the question of whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to employment announcements, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with good figures and "harmonical face traits".
They should be above average large - above 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ratio ends with the achievement of the 26th age.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically stressful.
“The most important is their image,” an unnamed district official announced at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, face traits, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but besides, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, does not wish to agree with this description,
However, it admitted that size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes in China are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform face traits.
Whether it’s going to be similar to good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
“Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or bucklings here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image wouldn’t be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bowls and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexistic that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asks with an ironic eye.
Her colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, “We have the task of representing the image of the city.”
According to their information, they don’t regret the short attitude because they had more ambitious career plans than just shaking merchants through the streets to prevent them from making business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers trying to sell as many brooks and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bicycle before being chased.
"Mr. Wang, please go away from here."
“We’ve told you that so often!” explains Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his nudel kitchen attached to a bicycle car.
According to the officers, the activity is rather monotone than stressful.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who study sales in recreational time.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants’ goods, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report their male superintendent.
This is intended to protect them from public assaults to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ran this year after rumor, Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the incident at night, 14 government vehicles were killed or fired.
Xindu remained saved from such violence outbreaks so far.
But disturbances cannot be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baongguang square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired in contrast to the rules on the citizenship rather than in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officials with a grim face brought the way to their vehicles and continued to drive the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained left, turning his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li sober.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Prosecutor will not be accused of Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Department of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and attempt to lobby their husband, Senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious appeal against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, until the scandal that provided national headlines and placed a damper to his career, he was considered as the possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s ethical committee could still impose a disciplinary punishment.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been stopped and that there is no further charge in this matter.
The Department of Justice did not want to speak on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, and there was sufficient evidence that Ensign abused the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents released for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009 gave an opportunity to assume that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral helpers, helped to make a profitable order to buy his silence about a matter with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to give Hampton work, and according to the documents and questions, he took lobby work for them after setting up Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign’s election team, he was not allowed to take a lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the affair, declined against the so-called ban of rotary door lobby.
According to the published indices, “it seems to be dealing with everything about an agreement and violation of the rotary door statutes,” says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients in the view of the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said the Department seems very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were persecuted by the media with great interest, including the last year’s decision to fall the charge against former Senator Ted Steven’s for miscons.
Prosecutors are "obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Washington Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and governmental circles of the United States), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another day the next day he was informed that the department will not file a complaint against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had acted "in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I'm not sure to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me, only so much was said: we think we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign’s lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stab Head, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "ancloping" at the Ministry of Interior for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobby work.
Last year, when he first requested information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign apologised to his voters and left his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the ranking of the Republicans.
After he had no longer noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he strives for a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said, hopefully that the ethical commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them left the crawls in the courtroom.
In a minute tact, they sent their reports on gracious witnesses on Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the rape process and children chained on beds in a house that emerged in flames.
On Thursday, the attentively persecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence the jury pronounced falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications to the court to demonstrate the reasons for a appeal and to deal with the courts for years.
One of the most provocating reasons is that by the intensive reporting of the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circussal atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of controversial details, so that the jury has been inadmissiblely influenced by public disaster.
This objection could lead the appeal courts to deal with the question of whether new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
“As I experienced during this process, I think it’s really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects each individual’s right to a fair process,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Hayes’ chief defender.
Chairman of the Supreme Chamber Court, Jon C. Blue, said that the new media would be “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions last week.
But this was certainly not yet the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous cases leads to doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historical decision of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the court hall" because of the new media.
Some people believe the television series and the film "Auf the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say judicial claims that Mr. Hayes condemnation a half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication pathways from the courtroom, which were still unthinkable at the time of the Dr. Sheppard case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of new media in processes that are persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who explain Mr. Hayes’ lawyers to discuss years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been previously prejudiced as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them gracious offence photos during the judge selection.
Some of the judges have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have hated them.
The defenders say they would also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a judge who was a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exercised inadmissible pressure on the judgment when he had made the judgment to free the week.
The judges were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment dispute they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor’s office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously rediscovered the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a daily range of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “you hadn’t experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Your focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the allegation that these direct news are more sound than reports that are slower to be returned is a technical adversary view that reduces the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts would often be confronted with the argument, which requires social and technical changes to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers increase this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was revoked due to the reporting, and made clear that the new media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "sheppard represented against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on blasphemous words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders on Tuesday did not have a breakthrough in the major issues that had been dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were made.
After all that you hear, it was neither a courtesy discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The President’s public gathering on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction will cause a mutual respect for a period of months, which will shut down the ideological gap that continues to separate members from one another.
This is hard enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one is required by the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while trying to devastate the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep that one could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the last two years.
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health, or waiting, both sides are kilometres away from each other.
Lastly, the November election voted at least for a short time.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than finding a solution.
Bush’s tax reductions will end the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, it is expected to be a compromise regarding increased unemployment pay, although only because the Republicans cannot afford themselves to believe that the favored tax lowers for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress will be convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consensus is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepsis is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of things happening from today until 2012, as a pre-fight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
As much as the Republican leaders may be worried about poking too high, they know they need to try to lower government expenditures and remove health reform.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the elevation of some taxes, as well as the increase of the pension age and the decrease of state expenditures.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan as the official recommendation and they are very struggling to even come close to this number.
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, as in financial matters, at least today, is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party collapses when the Republicans Obama challenge with regard to the state budget, taxes and health system, later followed by a phase of larger two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a suckle, as happened in 1995, then both parties have to carefully pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both parties’ activists see in 2010 as a pure preliminary game for a much more extensive 2012 consequence election.
Thus, the courtesy that will be presented this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
On both sides, however, it will require much more effort to find a common nominator in the issues that still separate them from each other.
U.S. document portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of "cleptocracy" and it gives part of the kidnapping and protective money that it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the U.S. embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the State Security Service express high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive living standard in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part from the money that the ladder moves upwards.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been written.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected charges of corruption for years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such charges.
In September, he declared to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led to some to call it “disturbed” and to conclude that the government is more like a kleptocratic than a government,” the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which means literally "dach" or protection), which extends over the police, state security (FSB), the Office of Services (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as throughout the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lower level."
“This is an incompetent system where criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help.”
The report continues to say that the FSB casses money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
A source, it’s called, “explains that Moscow’s business owners understand that it’s best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly before - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases who were probably full of money going to the Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in an interview.
“But he’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Throughout the country, it estimates that Russia’s corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks on 154th of a recent investigation on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which took place after Moscow late night, will certainly trigger faults within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that you solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a counterfeit and responded angry to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to be able to do with such arrogance, such a pressure, and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, concentrated classroom with dirty and flat walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him, the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he’s taken care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, has developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation against the government, long-term followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when condemned former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grows among the Khmers’ Red Veterans Alnlong Vengs, hardered their efforts to reconciliate and reintegration into Cambodia’s society.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It split families itself.”
During the Khmer Red rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese attacked and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government dropped, the remains of the regime and his military fled to Thailand to the Cambodia border.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, trouble.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok took the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move over to the government, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their genders no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into rural poverty in Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few Khmer Rouge elite officials retained their local government posts because they laid their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
“These people have benefited very little from the capitulation,” said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng, public forums.
“They are anchored into the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime.”
“They grew up without any professional knowledge.”
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live as a poor ricemaker.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
“Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat.”
But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will attempt to trial Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the abominations, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to mitigate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on the 64-year-old Im Chaem, which had been district chief during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she told officer of the documentation center of Cambodia that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw a long shadow on the dry grass, Chaem rejected to discuss its past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court charged her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no persecution anymore, it would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
“It’s our duty to put these broken parts together, so as everything can understand.”
The center created the first government-approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an attachment to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps the students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
“They are mistrustful because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court.”
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overwhelmed by bushes and with plastic waste leads to a rectangular of black rust, covered with a roast sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a hoof of tyres.
31-year-old Nuom Sothea, a cell phone seller on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people come here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last rest place where she will drop a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect further weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that no longer highly enriched uranium will be collected, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus’s Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus for years to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached an obstacle last spring.
However, officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium capable of weapons from a Belarus research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations” from April that Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next 2012 summit.
“I was really excited that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012).
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership of Global Security, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs from it and we will not sell it to anyone.”
“We use it only for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus nevertheless approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first start to remove Belarus’s uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarus research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on the global hazardous reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Extended Studies estimates that this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium with weapons and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is planning to dissolve its camp by 2012, according to the joint agreement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily due to Lukashenko’s disregard of human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and transmitted to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable), adding that former Deputy Chief Executive María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft that fly Spain will be adequately monitored."
In June 2006, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed the report of the Council of Europe in which the aid to human rights violating practices was charged in a dozen countries, including Spain.
The Deputy Chief of Government agreed that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in the outside" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory.”
“You just want to be informed” to not be “unprepared to be surprised,” Aguirre reports via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as it is in the hands of the judges.”
Attorney Vicente González, in January 2007, understood the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish intelligence office (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any loading or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a talk with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "appealing coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discrete handling between governments," Aguirre said.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, he commented that "though the Spanish judges are madly considering their independence and doing what they think is appropriate," he gave his staff instructions to "shocked rhetoric comments to avoid tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt from a indication that the government of Zapateros could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, tolerated or intentionally ignored, will beat capital even if these revelations could negatively affect the US government.”
The child killer admits she complained on the internet about the "work" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke about the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the internet.
Under this title, she has contacted with a cusine and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of witnesses of their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túnez, an industrialist.
She spent a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she became known she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former man never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon after that, she entered a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearics to look at the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they were separated.
In March 2008, she alone went to Menorca and writes, "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
“When I told him, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not be free, to be able to do and leave what he wants.”
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like I leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him out when I'm back."
In May, she says about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm just going to stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself to work on the 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She explains she takes her firstborn when everything goes well.
“He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me, and I will never leave him again with anyone except with my mother,” a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered, is assumed to be dead.
On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not.”
On the one hand, he is with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day.
She talks about a move to Mallorca.
"Where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the kids' girl."
17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me any videos to the e-mail. If you see if he wants, he finds me, like a fuck."
On the 30th one, "The boy's going well, he's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangalogs, there are messages from her.
She even had a blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison resigner".
"Terror to the Galician (Title) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, explains that he has consciences because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him that she was alone-parent mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Center for Court Prisoners to Menorca to the province prison of Palma.
The duty defender, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the outcome of the fact, “and she did not have the intention to cause harm to the small one.”
However, she had previously admitted to drunk Caesar in the bathtub and to put his body in a suitcase.

With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the significant growth of votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not - their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party makes in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People’s Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - the result of the redirection of the vote share of the PSC and the binding of the voters of the PP - should continue, the PP analytics forecast that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress members in the elections, while also CiU four (it now has 10) would win and the PSC at least 9 of 25 members.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose a member - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its member or win a member.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next appointment will be held with the municipality elections in May 2011, and the People’s Party (PP) may also be the tongue at the scale to end the socialist rule in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists cannot achieve a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not disgusting that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it should earn 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded a growth in its vote share in the four province capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's swing, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was able to grow significantly.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 town administrations of Catalonia and seeks to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell bought thousands of Al Qaeda passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven intelligence officers arrested by the barcelona police officers, Pakistani and Nigerians, formed the controlled jihadist cell from Thailand, the different Al-Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to Free Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the last was the author of the assassinations in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of Interior acknowledges these investigations of great importance, which goes so far that he assures that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakening" the Al Qaeda counterfeit apparatus worldwide and "so as to its ability to act".
The researchers assumes that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passes were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda was combined so that their "fighters" could without punishment exceed the boundaries of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only jihadist network that was active in Europe, and therefore, besides the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also contributed to the investigations, and it is not possible to exclude that in the next few days there will be similar attacks in the EU as those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was held in Thailand, as well as the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Butt.
They had led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was destroyed in 2009 - stealed in particular tourist passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigational circles, it is stressed that so far no connections could be demonstrated between the arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, Laschkar e-Taiba, was one of the receiving groups of the stolen in Spain and then fake passports in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars had been sent from a Catalonia-based assassination by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which prepared an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to delay the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his office as the Prime Minister of the Generality. These are not different from those already prepared during the election campaign, and can be combined with the priority of his economic resurrection and the absence of regional independence.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned with the safety to Artur Mas, which awarded her the 18 Members she won on Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel essential. For the candidate is dependent on the CiU Burger Regionalist Party that at least one of the opposition parties will vote at his vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the coming Congress parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP; however, the talks that Mas currently leads with the remaining party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC chairman of the party, the PPC calls for "all discussions relating to Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" to be placed behind, as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and which the Party Head of CiU even wants to undertake a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the built-in political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and to remove the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the joining of Mas are concerned by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Care House reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "failing measures"
The owners of the Oldenhouse in Olot don’t exclude that their nurses killed over eleven older people.
The officials of the La Caritat Old Care House in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they revealed the damage of the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old persons he was responsible for during his work.
The head of the Old Care House, Joan Sala, attended his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability forces us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it had not detected the criminal actions of the nurse in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime was declined in August 2009 and that he has continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies – former patients at the old care house – as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The Head of La Caritat denied this point and stated that “lacking measures could not have been the reason for the incidents.”
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there are no evidence in the dispute of any person’s negligence than the accused.”
The baptised "angel" held eleven murders before yesterday, declaring that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that the second old lady was killed a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different reassurance agents.
Head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the reassurant cocktail used the nurse for six of nine crimes committed to free patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila actually lies and for his first victims chose a less cruel death or whether he burned it from inside by giving them white-glauge, as he had done with three women, according to the confession he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, no faith is given to the nurse's statements, not even the number of confessed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and there is no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and for the reach of these incidents of justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that markets should not underestimate our response capacity.
Euro peripheral countries’ risk rates have increased dramatically and European bank shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has barely attained points, which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market that is recovered to the extent it collapses, however as a result of the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose its fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to revoke our liquidity actions, according to which the ECB must revoke for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the implementation of the plan for the purchase of state debt as these are ineffective, and the removal of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures, which should only be kept on a week’s unlimited access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access to the quarterly end to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to purchase obligations to continue and expedite a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday, and if we remain hard to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reaffirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets then collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state title in Portugal was fairly weak.
The government’s asset management expendited only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal rose by 30 base points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10,000 million in the short term and possible another 15,000. There is time to acquire private capital until February or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discussion more moderate in terms of the summit of the Heads of State and the Government on 14 December, where political unity is requested to show that we jointly play the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of state deficit, liberalization, privatization and labour procurement measures, which sounds in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish exchange increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year state bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, and therefore we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our redebtability.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury Office has €40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should match the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it counts not only the being, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do it!
Chief Executive Officer of Eulen appoints Vega Sicilia's Partnership Meeting at his children's request
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, the owner of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not flash.
David Álvarez, the founder of the corporate belt, will dispute the El Enebro Partnership Assembly, which will take place on the 16th, at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them absolutely innocent. His children will try to gain a majority to control the corporate administration bodies – owner of the vineyards Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children, Jesús David and María José, prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their dispute for controlling a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not seem willing to give up in his dispute to control the institutions of El Enebro.
He was driven out of the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, which appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholder meeting of 18 January this year, which was already registered in the Trade Register as disputed.
The shareholder assembly of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Commerce Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderfall in the family Álvarez.
The appeal of the judge to the assembly is the only legal path that ensures the conference of the Assembly.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to declare fraudulents and abuse of law by means of legal appeal for non-declared assembly of 18 January."
This argument is the basis for the dispute of the assembly in the afterwards, in order to explain it as "absolutely innocent".
The same protagonists who were covered in discreet silence in June tried unsuccessfully to convene a congregation on a judicial path.
At El Enebro - asset company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, calls for the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the matter which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the dispute appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this renowned universe.
At the beginning, no one gave attention to the newborn, and despite his steep upgrading course during the last seasons, all of them put on the end track last November to the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without decreasing the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull has put into hands, creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company brought to the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with cars.
This PLM computer science program has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose of a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens’ Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on races and tests.
Russwurm suggests that in 1992 ten technicians worked in the race stalls, who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements in a season.
Today, in Red Bulls team, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV facilities, they perform analytics and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s race cars, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only boundary set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that can spend a Formula 1 team for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacturing of its race cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are heavily limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources that the energy drinking manufacturer puts in the services of his participation in the race tracks, other protagonists hide themselves, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is equal to zero.
The factory’s tech manager Steve Nevey stressed that five years ago, we could still say that the progress in the field of R&D contributed to victory for race cars with 50 percent, and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology represents 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15%.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are “unpredictable gladiator.”
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) confessed his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of one of twenty stores sales networks with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, deputy chairman of HP España, called the rebuilt store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
By 2010, the North American group plans to set up 200 sales offices in Europe, including 20 offices in Spain.
The first ones were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but he did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Deputy Chairman, also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for the opening of the store is always the same, based on a local distributor with experience and industry expertise.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for touch). All shops will look equal in Europe.
HP is also responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it is not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales station network is intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro companies in purchasing and afterwards, yes even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system has been developed in particular for small and micro companies as well as private customers, as large companies have already had their service contracts for technical customer service,” said Helena Herroro.
Sabadell wants a million customers to 'close' its rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s Executive Board member Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a break in interest rates that the banks attempt to compensate with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an still-existing field.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year guide schedule in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million customers - 700,000 when you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose -. This is the big challenge that the bank faces, because it has so far dedicated more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, she added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction, and the challenges faced by the bank will present it together with the annual account report.
Only few banks dare to set and publish objectives in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the plans of banks worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its four-year-old Optima schedule, which was initially designed to three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings cash are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "tough" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes Spain is just "slow" out of the crisis.
Furthermore, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - essential for the survival of banks.
Even though he assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will be offset, the risk additions that banks and savings have to pay for their emissions to gain liquidity will already be rolled off as a compensation for falling profit margins on the loan price.
"The topics of liquidity and funding are structural and they will exert pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola said.
On Thursday, Banesto had already arranged its branch network to restrict long-term loans and increase interest differences (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks are currently pursuing the stategia to "raising fees", but "inside a framework marked by the competition".
Sabadell’s guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "bigger companies are needed."
“Next year everything will change,” he says.
He emphasizes the need for capital at the moment "enormally rises" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions to slide into red numbers.
He believes that FROB can replace the money market with captain increases.
After he assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of markets, he removes the argument of some bankers who already prophesies a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be brought into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be achieved via repo transactions and thus stop the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta denied yesterday the possibility that a merger of savings could come and emphasized the speed that the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish savings concentration process began, several savings were not insisted on to participate in the first phase, and they retained the second round.
In contrast, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I think the majority of the mergers have been completed, but the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"The majority is complete. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seventeen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Federation of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA) Olavarrieta said that the concentration process “has been carried out as soon as possible and that we have to be satisfied with the timely expiration that was established in previous times, not now, under the business plans with Banco de España.”
“The transition from 45 savings casses with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger, with which we have met the Basel Agreement,” he said.
Olavarrieta explained that “there would be a number of unappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed uncertainty and insensitivity” because “Banco de España urges us to complete in time before the end of the year.”
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” in the whole world and supplemented that those who doubted that would do “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic reconjunction we have to "no worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings cash that have passed through a "very significant" concentration process that will be "fulfilled as quickly as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had performed the stress tests the ECB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to retain the euro, but at the same time established conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulating time businesses or withdrawing the 426 Euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment pay, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Chief Government Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It was anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake of her public relations.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany adopts a fundamentally new perspective of designing our future, which conflicts with maintaining the old traditions of a majority of its partners.
In view of the resistances in Europe, we begin to speculate in Germany over three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the re-introduction of the German Mark - although this sounds more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third parties: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control; strict fiscal management; punishment of the countries that overcome the requirements; more possiblely, the setting of payments of some countries and the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position has been clear and has been distinguished for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission gained incentives for deficits and the German government moved out of a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the difference between what Germany felt necessary (strength tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign laid the Middle-European country as Merkel painfully left the decision to rescue Greece.
This was criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion were absolutely against Greece's rescue.
Lastly, Merkel comes out again in the last October days with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country, while at the same time committing private loanmakers to bear some of the costs.
This position was designed as an anti-European as it drives the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although somewhat agreed, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the European Union reform, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the countries that are infringed can be harshly punished, forced to explain themselves incapable of payment, and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the payment balance, as listed by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly to not understand it.
It is not just about dropping the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will go more quietly.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we will offer until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of yesterday’s new measures) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t seem that something would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should not leave the euro area fully trapped with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The presumed exclusion from two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match against the Ajax in Champions League on November 23 resulted in a lot of ink being poured out, whether it was an unsportive act or not, and whether the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the prescribed sanction in the next match against the Auxerre, thus entering the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the present case is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (which in his hymn predicted nobility and honor and in other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role in this, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, which added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provoking technical.
In any case, the debate is about whether the behavior which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a rule, in fact, this approach keeps the statutes of sport, but it seems to be dealt with its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the counter-players, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the players who are contrary to have an unjustified benefit from the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not match what we usually understand under wrong play or regulation, because the rule’s removal was not secretly carried out to avoid a penalty, but should be as vigilant as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players were waiting off and joyfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers were taken from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized here that neither the rival was brought into a more unfavourable position nor the advantages of the played game were heated, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage obviously is that players start the next stage of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, unknown advantage to a certain degree, as the team could also exit at some point. In addition, players with this approach receive a sanction and go into the second card cycle in which they exit less than in the first cycle due to accumulation of a card.
It is not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such action is not against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the rules as much as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to handle a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of regulation), they would rather choose when they were subjected to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping a penalty.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is dismantled, I believe that this matter is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemics have arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of rule transmission provocated.
The damage incurred to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer Offensive for Customer Retrieval for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
This year’s calendar dictatorship leaves a lawn of reservations to the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread, and they don’t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are group dinners in the pre-evening period, which will bring oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurants and leisure business. But as a result of the economic crisis, they cancel a price offense to catch the customer segment, which represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to give out the entrepreneur’s between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner.
In order to make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) has left all orders down in the week of December 13, with the result of a lavine of dinner reservations at two top tallers (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before it.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order to not have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, lowest prices are required, confirmed the chairman of the Barcelona Gaietà Farràs Gaietà.
The representative of the roof association will not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
“People think about it forty times before they book.”
“They want to go out, but they look forward to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and remind us that customers are saving in crisis times, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday would be booming with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economy.
With another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the calendar has led to pre-reservations, even from early November.
"We have made possible the impossible to maintain the prices of the previous year with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, does not lose optimism after revenues have flourished again and are good since the second quarter, even though a few days of focused outlook for the Christmas business.
Sources of the corporate group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups pre-Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more than a price heat. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green springs spray, which is why the employees are invited again, which gives the impression that the groups are in rise again.
From the sides of the Fecasarm roof association (with concentrations such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), Deputy Chairman Enric Gomà knows to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall rather "vibrant", although customers "a maximum output".
The fun of the celebration has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear program excites great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileaks’ revelations confirm relationships between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. state department confirms the huge concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not strengthened, but rather "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country makes more nuclear weapons "to a faster" than any other country.
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but are stored in order to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: “The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the susceptible dispersion of nuclear material, and the vulnerability to the transport of nuclear material.”
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and missile programs is no longer considered by the United States, but also by Russia as an outstanding and reason for caution.
“Pakistan has to hire strictly faithful personnel to guard nuclear plants; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work with nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan declines in nuclear spread and the increased pace in which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" is explained: "There is often no transparency; on help offers we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that “despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the Chief Executive Officer General Ashfaq Kayani to "clair the responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent support for terrorist groups."
On Hunting for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a senior responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol provides a red warning on the pursuit and finding of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be explained hard.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for Assange's "finding and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
It’s not new, it’s dated November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the last unveiling of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
The founder of Wikileaks' lawyer Mark Stephens also assured that "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
On 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) on Sweden's request issued the order, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to arrest him and deliver him on a temporary basis."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably remains.
Assange’s lawyers were annoyed to publish a letter informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities through video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for departure from Sweden and was given the appropriate approval by the prosecutor, compared with Stalin's Safety Chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," he said.
While the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia defeats from her son's innocence - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an undefined place and in the conversation he requested the withdrawal of the US State Secretary Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for the ordering of North American diplomats to espionate the United Nations and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not sure why we should pay attention to a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documentation.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announce in these days.
Congressmen Peter King, who will be chairman of the National Security Committee of the House of Parliament from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to capture their funds and to pursue anyone who supports or contributes them."
Tom Flanagan, Canadian President Stephen Harper’s advisor, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be “murded”.
“Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use an unmanned aircraft or anything.”
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who broke out information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is a mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with an eyewind towards the Carod Nearby Peace in ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its continuity in office.
Huguet suggests a more pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the sixth time of an internal revolt in the rows of the loss of 11 members and half of the voters' directionless ERC votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the nearby of former leader of the Party, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor himself and does not give him the same headbreak as other former flows.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eyewind, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning yesterday announced that the over 200 regional Council members of ERC could speak secretly about their remaining in office.
With voting cells, not with high-hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the president a penalty, they could do this without having to fear repressibilities.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of split and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he reaffirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby demands the president more than just to provide his office to the party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the senior organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board of Directors a plan of procedure from now to May.
To do this, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership will submit to the Council on the 18th to vote.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, which, in return, is to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party’s top already considers to be a fact.
The chairman of the ERC’s party believes that the “polyphony” is a shame for stability and he seeks once and for all to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which the official Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog, is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the president of the party is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five of which two are at the forefront.
First, the “restructuring” of the Board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, means the inclusion of new faces from Carod’s environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
This enforces a reform of the statutes to enable congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the termination of the general assembly model – an exception in the Spanish party system – Puigcercós’ team, who already fought for the last two congresses, is how obsessed.
In fact, at the beautiful assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a Congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still expired, since the internal rest of the last years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could have come to re-attack and complete this matter forever.

China maintains its goals to reduce greenhouse gases
China’s representative said at the COP16 its country has made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the COP16, assured.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made huge efforts to decrease carbon traces and transform its industry.
He showed that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the contrary, he explained that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot program support.
He explained that progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that the authorities of the states in China had collaborated with those of the central state and the communities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he has already been implemented or completed several years of plans, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funding from other countries.
For example, he referred to the efficient use of energy programme, which has been introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
It also runs a province-level climate change project, another to exchange traditional light bulbs through energy savings and another to weaken and adapt, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be generally accepted.
He showed that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
The energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the past five years, and further is expected to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former president of the Panist Party had the right to contact the National Order Commission and demand that which was the right to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had been right and that the former president of the Party of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was granted to him.
In an interview took place before the appeal file Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"In his case, Mr. Espino has the right to contact the Commission de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate has never sit at the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional strengthened the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that never was on the negotiation table, at least not until now. It was a pre-elect for the community elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panistic leader explained that the PAN looks back at 71 years’ dialogue, so “the internal competition doesn’t scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy them and they strengthens us.”
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman who needs the Acción Nacional for the next three years, and that is why he passed the stacked “to the one the Council would decide.”
"I am totally unanswered and open, and I would be proud to give each of the five the office of the president of the party."
He predicted that the party’s resurrection in the last elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next elections, although “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
“Now it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.”
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa carry the flag and would be observed throughout the country. That is why "lots of hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI followers to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the cabinet," he said.
He believes that the holder of the Federal Government could make expressions like those in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no mouth ban in this country and less a censorship.
Obama engages on Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
“If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this Act,” the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this Act,” Obama tweeted.
His short release contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls upon the public to contact their senators, among other things, as the vote of the law is immediately coming.
“With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he said.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the expansion of tax reductions from Bush’s times and the government’s funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could affect the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Act Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Speaker Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is solved, a schedule for the remaining projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be handled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would "appeal to vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although next week would be more likely.
The Dream Act, or American Dream Act, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who were immigrating to the United States when they were not sixteen years old, during the last five years living in the country and registered in a higher educational institution or in the army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the defenders of this project have an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn the initiative back.
The most recruited Republicans include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who pronounced the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and on this occasion used her question subtitles (on another event, the round table).
The finger in the wound... "took us in difficulty," the Argentine writer sweetly encountered the audience, composed mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to assist this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Montera and García.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized the Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes to doctor whom she doesn't get an answer, but indications for the guide to her narrative.
She convinced the infectologist, "Patient is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who stole her breath in the middle of the walk, and who explains that the wound was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story makes it easier and closes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and doesn't exist," but she is convinced that the pleasure of language and their falls blends.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative he called “Lobby of the Invention” and in which his finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With magic realism, he tells of a famous wizard who touched the clouds, brought back away a long traveled men, or restored the virtue of a girl lost. The story made a turn and reported of America, the great novel to whom it did not lack his own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the flux.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spoke the predicted Witnesses who appeared in the true stories shown, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination power that even disappeared the shame feeling."
However, he emphasizes that “it’s the crazy and liars who imagine things best,” and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs, where the fictional literature reachs the summit.
He actually calls this the "Tradition Cervantes".
“We inherited from him to be what is told.”
When Mayra Montero was in the series, she commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation had contributed to the round table ‘The Finger in the Wound’.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting her country – like all of Latin America – as a result of struggles for drug trafficking.
“I believe good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentionally planned commitment,” she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and liability that build up between the author and readers as in a “chemical reaction”.
The evening decided the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also hevorhows “the finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer.”
He noticed that in a fast-facing world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness are also going out of dogmatisms, and he forgot that “a small no is behind every confirmation and a small yes is behind every denial.”
“In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuancers often mean to put the finger into the wound and to molest those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, black and white, to move into the prefabricated ideas without nuances of the world, and also the mighty molest those who prefer black.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he experienced up and up in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey during the final game, there are also two different styles, predicted by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced Abs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has felt good, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian played with the medal as the second champion, he left a step behind the victors and, surprisingly, he played consecutive final games with the same team.
The Santist Strategy reached the first final match as a coach at the Torneo Apertura 2002, when the Morelia had the trenches in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the Clausura 2003, he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost against Rayados with 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to return to the match with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be persecuted once again from the misfortune and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what's happening before is the most important thing," he said.
“The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator ends, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also prepared, for the last time we were prepared to depart with two eleven meters, and I don’t believe that there is a teaching until the end.”
Knowing that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooting, don't worry him, because he acquainted his players: "You never want to arrive at the elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there's no alternative, and you need to be prepared for this title, in the previous tour we're already prepared, but unfortfully prepared the fatency of a bad game, sometity.
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just a second champion and to cost for the first time the glory the title brings.
US changes rules for receiving a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation at the consulate at the visa application service agencies; costs will be shortened.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and in the consulates will be changed.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their discussion in the consulate at the visa application service agencies (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The ASC staff takes into account the biometric data of the applicant reviewed by the consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The overall cost of the visa processing decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the date agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transportation service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterweight of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk at the consulate; they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC where they submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for discussion in the consulate remain less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service supply.
Additional information on the new procedure for visa application can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial lives
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to introduce tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in all.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it will introduce "an insightful foundation for the search for alien life", which triggered speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that it could exist in hostile environments, which were thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures. It was raised the hypothesis that they could turn into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their conditions of life improved.
It is apparently a microbe found on the ground of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that is considered too toxic for all thought-like forms of life as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbies use the arsena as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there could be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsena, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that “there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from what we know.”
The space agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual reach of its fund.
Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, participates in the conference, and biolog Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron form an opposition block
With the reform of the Congress organ law, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The sixty-seventh legislative period had just begun, and a block of opposition was already installed, led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined himself as an independent.
Prior to the beginning of the introductory meeting in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patron Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as they were excluded by this.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He suggested that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI in order to change the scheme, and if they did not have it, they would be subjected again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until I come here (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we're being excluded from all decisions that don't even take into account the opinions of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should be governed in Congress.”
"For the beginning, this group begins with five members and they talk to other colleagues to become more," the Convergencia member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT explained in appeal to PAN and PRI that Congress has currently turned into a ‘beat’ for two.
“It was just one party before, now they share them up to two.”
Patrón Montalvo requested that Members respect and assign them their place to the negotiation table.
"The five, which are currently divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiation table, because because of reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and have not agreed with this reform."
200,000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over a little more than 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the amount paid to the company’s owner for electrical materials in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued at a amount of 200.144.56 Peso with number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had previously previously sent that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoria Superior del Estado because it sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and as a result the number of checks that are still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought with her, it’s just paid the debt, just like with the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "dipped" again in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasury assured that their services would not be reused.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the examination of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers on July 25, it was known that it had already paid the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she introduced checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into the breakdown of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán’s tourism industry requested special attention to the authorities, areas that are in a poor condition and cast a poor picture of the port town.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the dealer association of Zona Dorada, recalled that at different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and the bad conditions that tourists find to transform into new job opportunities or routes.
He said the poor state of the roads and walkways would have had a negative effect, as tourists would come to the walk and see the disorder, and then they would turn the nearby shops to their backs.
“The politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn’t do the construction work slowly and flatly in this way.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance from the city.
"The community has to assume its responsibility and avoid anything like this happening once again. How to do it? Well, by preventing maintenance instead of restoring everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourism area, it needs to be maintained, but also we inhabitants have the right to have a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unclear and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions constantly keep shot," he added.
“These arrangements have not been paid enough attention and this type of incidents puts just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and create a bad picture.
He mentioned a series of places that should be brought to the frontman together with the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and bring them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members should take great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán calls for a worthy parliament, free of arrangements, intersecting the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is reluctant and stands in front of major problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It consists of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 by PAN, three by Partido Nueva Alianza, two by PRD, one by PT, one by Convergencia and one by PVEM. This makes up a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean work, to feel committed to society and the different social groups relying on a responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take great responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, which make themselves carnival partnerships of governors and leaders of parliamentary groups."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care of them to perform a trusted job and, above all, engage for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, as today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow encourage the creation of jobs.”
In terms of the tourism industry, he asked the new members to give the necessary priority in the government budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
“I have understood that it’s the secondest funding of the Ministry, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry.”
Tourist projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been reintroduced in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Three-Royal Day, because the household is no longer and no less than twelve persons and a goat goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they want.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand into the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes it's hard time because my husband has no job, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon, I'm going to sell with the goars to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like to have a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes to have a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight months old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one year.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive,' Cayetana remembered sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is being sought' by giving a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Northeast newspaper.
14 alleged drug dealers are arrested
On Wednesday, during the breakdown of a cannabis production and sales network, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out.
Fourteen people were arrested and various charges will be charged.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served primarily in drug manufacturing.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Hashish, cash and equipment that have served in production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the security police of Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of which two of the men who are considered the main wire drivers of the drug ring were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared hours after they were arrested before the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, its possessions for sales purposes, the complot and the service of crimes.
These house investigations had taken place as a result of a long investigation activity that went on for over a year.
"The information obtained from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
About the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estria, the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority, had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily persecuted
The bill of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, is intended to address the problem of vessels loaded with secret immigrants, will be stamped in all aspects after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
“I reject this charter with resentment.”
“I’m holding with a party that put chains at your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, Chief of Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting expired in front of the gathered members.
The Liberals claimed that the bill that allows to hold each person identified by an illegal immigrant sea ship for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he would not be able to support the bill as he turned against the wrong target audience.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has demonstrated the critics from the hands that demand their party did not behave sufficiently standing towards the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against blind passengers, and we are just trying to enforce by broadcasting another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not therefore endorse the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks the guilt of refugees and keeps children in prison for at least a year,” said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“The Canadians urgently tell members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, those criminal processes that affect Canada and treat the country as a foot detaineer.”
“They expect Canada to take tough measures,” said the reaction of Minister Kenneys.
“The government has not announced any vote of trust regarding its bill that could lead the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that every opposition member will immediately explain himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find agreement
Despite the announcement of the eventual establishment of a new unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, claims that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the Wednesday announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this action was not at least discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
There was also no lack of the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québecis Party, qualifyed this announcement in point of public safety as "enchanted rabbit from the hat" and "to a table-end solution".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who were afraid that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
“You will see the result when we’re going to announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest continues to want to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
“The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, a faculty of ethics and political systems at the ENA.
In order to get out of this crackdown, he suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the financial audit control, so that it can investigate corruption and secret agreements.
“You should be able to expand the mandate of audit control,” he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power to audit control as Commissioners, which would also allow it to commit people to state.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the charest government’s drawers.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to change the criminal law in order to be better adjusted to this type of crimes.
This demand comes from the Senior Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction in this type of law enforcement is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of Public Safety, confirmed his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dividing himself with certain novelations concerning this dossier.
During the 2001 Spring Operation, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterity.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has elapsed since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, it came to an earthfall on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another land trip took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street is crowded in itself.
From Wednesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters has spread over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Here, a total of up to 100 millimeters of rainshowers have fallen down.
Since the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is still to be added to these precipitations, the overcoming of several water runs is afraid.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service announced warnings about the alarm of the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinian mountains and the oak in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and continue to be observed.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe precipitation has moved to the overcoming of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was broken down due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the transition of certain lakes caused the closing of several streets, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alarm and monitors the situation most accurately, said Security Council Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highland Water Centre issued warnings of several rivers, particularly Maskinonge, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Wolf.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial return in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as because of his exhaustive speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the view that while Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, certain statements "contained inaccurate information on social care and unauthorized negative representations of Haitians, as well as such an unexpected speech that is not adequate to the transmissions broadcast over the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the transmissions issued in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was placed as a result of a complaint of the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment were inaccurate.
Moderators should rather provide solid as misleading information.
Regarding the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont said suicide was an expression of fear.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the conveyed message was that suicide cannot be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the affected consequences of the mission "Dupont le midi" had cut a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not accused of any blame to his person.
The last point of dispute was about the statements that had been related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-moderator had explained that he didn’t donate to the benefit of Haiti’s aid, because he wouldn’t certainly know whether the needy would really get the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitians.
“I have already lost my three-day suspension penalty in this matter.”
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board advocates the dissemination of an unexpected expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcasting station, which, among other things, had to report his decisions once during the main delivery period within a three-day period, are small.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete who shines in "Sanda" (full-contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, now goes on to the Tatami and the box rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started in Algeria 12 years ago with fighting sports such as kung-fu and kickboxen,” said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to continue to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the struggle everywhere, because for those who present the ground struggle, like the mixed combat arts, do not like, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, his sign worker as a security officer, as well as UPS employees, gave his rivals bad news, in which he earned two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickbox and Thai box,” he said.
“I’m currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China.”
"They were invited to fighters from every category who had placed themselves in the last four World Championships."
"I picked up babe 2009 in Toronto bronze."
"2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
“In 2007, I finished the fifth-range tournament in China while I became third in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
“With this rhythm I will become the first this time or next year!”
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where hands and foot beatings are allowed as well as floor beatings.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarely in a box ring.
The most prestigious box fighter, who has come from this type of battleport, is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of battle art.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
“This competition is the highest rank and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic £.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).
“That was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before he then lost in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals each meet each other in the final of their category."
“Then the winners of each category offer their forehead to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu.”
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has, in mutual agreement, granted $450 million in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this lavender of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, at a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Energy gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, its responsibility to deliver this important, hydroelectric project of a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energy gérance" gained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, returning to corporate consortiums is a serious ethical problem that encourages the risk of competition extrusion and price increases.
“This is a new way of playing a card and destroys competition.”
“This means that instead of mapping games rather than in secret ways are now performed in an open manner,” said Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by heavily arguing that this agreement would have been a ticketed game.
“I remain faithful to my line,” she warned, strengthening that the PQ was “unreal” and “leaving her hardness.”
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is worldwide common practice.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise in terms of a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its work dimension.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be launched by 2012.
However, the agreement was awarded without a competition able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects, is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" reported last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of construction engineering and consulting is the subject of governmental investigations.
A short overflight from the Quebec corporate register allows for more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, returns to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energy gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay has been subject to special workers' dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has in particular invoiced this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose about the fact has led to the approval of the project management contract after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will be quick to high."
“So you have two options: either you take the people on this Mart and tell you, you will negotiate a satisfying agreement at a good price.”
"The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the persons," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Energy gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Quebec.
The contracts were either approved by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and advisory agreements, the companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resources labs, have been allocated between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had reached 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energy management".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti Liberal du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau said the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "financed" before it made it clear that it is rather their leaders.
Barometer Conscious Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but unwounded skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence on the main actors of sustainable growth, but not on the brands marked or the eco-marks to control his choice.
Shame, though it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it is only so widespread of information in favor of a more responsible conscious consumption: the barometer has complained a lack of credible information, an insufficiency that has been made known as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebec people nevertheless seem to sell them to pay little loans.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population agree to in fact give little faith to the environmental commitment of companies as the green company advertising, the measuring instrument, which is skilled by the Sherbrooke University’s responsible consumer center.
Another find: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands declared themselves as environmentally conscious.
According to the same pattern, the discussion of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information regarding responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently revived by nearly one-third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful character of the information deterred the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, a third of Quebecers is untrustworthy against the specified efficiency of the green products and services that we strive to put on their hands.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they also preferred 61% of purchases from dealers in their districts and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible conscious - the index of environmental conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - Quebec's homo consumption loves to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecs have indicated that they use public transport in 2010 or have preferred the driving center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey were also supported by the footstep as well as cycling.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was urged by Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris Kinocomplex, agrees to cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and Parallelle, which had hoped to receive a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the eXcentris cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois at Boulevard Saint-Laurent, apparently did not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to engage in this matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government rather offers a bond at less than the initially expected level that could bring into life an existential solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources removed from the state ruling kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the bit request has been corrected summariously since the once again downwards.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Societé de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a last report.
However, the cabinet's counter proposal was transmitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallel and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the state donation really seem to have been pushed to the side.
Let’s remind us that the Quebec Cinema and Cinema Complexes owner community had rejected a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial aid for real estate projects there, which he did not allow to provide for other cinema halls either.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed construction of the cinema, had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the State Case.
The lack of cinema showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientes on the rod.
The Société Angus and the company Parallelle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on the other hand, run a privately funded campaign from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one canvas continues to showcase films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27th next year with the demonstration of Xavier Beauvois' very successful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not revoke the newspaper "Le Devoir" and you ignore what he and his group think of the suggestions you made downwards.
Mystery of Complex Shaken Canada
The new American diplomatic lines, disseminated by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations consider under the Canadian minority complex towards the Americans; but with the same impact they reveal the feeling of superiority towards the last-named Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter did not have Canadian-American relations in the voting course, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative Government implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more picking details than the mere substantial content that you have to crack down.
A connection dating on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full run, reports from which point the United Nations no longer participate in the interventions discussed by its political leaders.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various possibilities of explanation of this situation.
“A complex of almost inhabitant minority of Canadians may lead Canadian political leaders to talk more about inner issues of everyday life than moving the United States to the Black Peter at this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade),” he said.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the proverb Goliat of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands the "thinking silence" less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he says, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has in the sense as a key factor during the urning process.”
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, which President Barack Obama is intended to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence in the federal budget vote at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a $30-40 billion livelihood program,” Breese said.
He had not mentioned anywhere that the government had to delay the Parliament meeting before Christmas in order to prevent the Parliament from crashing from the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed living programme.
Another communication dated and written by Ambassador Wilkins from January 2008 agrees Washington’s increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC spread from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle accusations to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also abductions for the purpose of hearing carried out by CIA’s muscle processes.
Another news reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe is ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is supposed to have answered the question with yes, however, on the basis of an individual "case-to-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he has handed a paper to the State Secretary in point Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to see the file again."
Finally, let’s note that the minds of the WikiLeaks website are warming.
Tom Flanagan, an old consultant and Stephen Harper, had stated about CBC that the responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide Plan for Renewal of Lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GFC), which is almost one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized to stabilize the climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the United Nations hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments of the developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs delivered to Earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-glazing pears, which still represent a monopole of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diods (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world’s vehicle park.
Last year in Copenhagen, large exhaust gas emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that should drop global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, we would have to remove 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from going out of control.
In the white-blushing pears, 95% of the energy in the form of heat removes, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs reduced this energy requirement twice.
The compact light bulbs maintain between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that Philips manufacturer launched this week - this company has, by the way, participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumed 80% less energy than a white-glazing bulb, which means the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that novel light bulbs deliver very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory resistance.
They do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore need to erase them as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that the manufacturers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants run out 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects excited to announce the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "inexpected" publication of the results of the elections of the Ivory Coast presidency immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further rebound," said a press spokesman of the UN chief.
He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the publication of the provisional results.
Despite the pressure of certain foreign governments, the electoral commission, which was fixed on Wednesday at midnight, made the deadline passed three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline was expired, the CEI President on television confirmed that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many appeals from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally express the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the departure of Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" vote fees in the north by the Constitutional Council obtained by the former rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed push in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Head of the Ivory Coast Presidency Campaign, had confirmed that the FN's mannews to intimidate voters in the north of the country had scared the president's followers to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the lawsuits made by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the view that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely connected to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the announcement of the election results as "inacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His alliance party reaffirms that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows he lost; and submits a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for them in the event of possible exclamations.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the votes compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who brought the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis is stable 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted information published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The second quarter figures amounted to 9.3% of the employee population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the departments in the overseas.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not occupied, but they wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were employable every two weeks, or whether or not they were employee seekers.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, on their own, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-old, 6.6% including the departments in the overseas.
Only 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
Following a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office, continues in this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (included overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September on Tuesday.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a discharge company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation proceedings were launched and he was incarcerated in prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence during an investigation of the public markets and under suspicion of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of disruption of society, disruption of general goods, hellery, corruption counsel, unauthorized abduction and weapon possession, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is preparing to express himself on all questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brainspins.”
"It's easy to submit to him a series of punishable charges, another thing is to prove this," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (socialist party) in the department, had emphasized to give the judge a memorandum to his justification by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A family member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to attorney Lucien Simon, her customer had never done anything other than keeping his depony running.
He would never have been aware of the business competence area or the destination of the funds associated with it, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the municipality Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for undercriminal and complicit, but then under the mandate to be held away from the protagonists of these acts under court supervision.
"My customer was able to provide explanations about the facts he was accused."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to take him off his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four others were charged and released from prison on Wednesday night, including two of them under legal surveillance, Deputy Attorney-General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy executive officer of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted by court due to "unlawful influence and passive abduction".
Two state officials of the municipality Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "Abstracting and Dispersion of General Goods by an Officer of Public Service", the other due to "Midwest in Dispersion of Public Funds".
Lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "helerie and undercovering society".
Among the people faced with Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned due to a similar affairs of public fraudulents affected by Corsica.
The Fahnders suspect his society to have helped wash money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the field of disposal, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous writings in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
Near investigation sources show that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the supply and the operation of a depony in La Ciotat, which are also waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille City Retreat Area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Rice: Elysée Palace oversees its mediation function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 until May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "spionage", the French public breathed, alarmed diplomacy and accentuated the worsening of relationships between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" present some backgrounds of this crisis.
They described how Elysée had explained his strategy to Americans who went to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of hostage in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the liberation of Majid Kakavand, an American justice-trapped in France due to trade in materials in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Rice in a bright light.
In fact, he did nothing in this regard.
A diplomat electrograph written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostage arrests".
François Richier, Elysée Adviser in Strategy Issues, talked in accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advised Americans to do everything to bring back their own citizens who would be violently arrested in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "soon release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into embarrassment, which is very sensitive to its image.
"It's more done, especially because the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "the silence still doesn't resolve anything", the attempts of discussion over the unremarkable pathways that the Iranians are "masters in escape manoeuvres".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "good, Iranian tactic": "hospitality for the purpose of political depression."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which was to occur on August 16, on the day she fled to the French embassy) "solicited the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro deposit).
And he lets Elysée anticipate further hostages, a phenomenon that will "sharpen himself".
“In the near future, the Iranians could arrest another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Rizs was released from prison twelve days ago, but continues to be held in Iran.
An information was brought into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery the United States demands to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials, has been released from prison according to a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France purchase a cow trade?
The Liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On occasion of a re-talk with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only “entirely surprised by the judge’s decision,” but also tried to stand up against it.
"There has been a rainful exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier also would like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strength" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, re-earns, then reports the American diplomat, the Iranian "finding up to the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée does not save his efforts to believe “flight attempts” organized by the media that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a “important” and “influential media role.”
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation carries fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating August 25, 2009 summons “the media flash of the French authorities.”
On what is based so much "thank you testimony" to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy asks itself.
“Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that caused the Elysée to fall out of this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “aim to confirm Sarkozy’s policy of opening towards Syria,” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time was "perceived by numerous votes of critics in France and abroad as premature and unprecedented."
"The Syrian role building" attempts Paris to "see Syria which belobition can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to “seed a difference between Syria and Iran.”
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
“We thanked them despite everything.”
“This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countrymen."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Ashbrood", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, stated government officials.
A bill, which aims to urge online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games, will be presented to Parliament in December, reported representatives of Culture and Family Ministries.
Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning in school and also leading a normal day-to-day life.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again in the morning from 6 a.m.
The manufacturer’s companies had a year long to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also keep in mind to ask the manufacturers to screw down the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an uncontrolled champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea gained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Court of Justice
In a bright excitement due to suspicion of corruption, FIFA’s Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the examiners of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political choice in which the rankings of influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is sure: the 2018 issue of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high town (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the head of Belgium and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Championship.
So the making behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to FIFA’s assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer more arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could equally be able to ruin the opportunities for their own country, the weight of football, which only was allowed to perform the World Championship once, namely in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC once again broadcast a documentary report taking three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under shot.
Reason enough to angry the FIFA and bring the English responsible to embarrassment, who primarily performed intensive lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
He hopes to re-edition the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-assess the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumpets with its already finished stages, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM in 2004) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
Possible repressibilities against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the opportunities of Russia that has become a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadies, hotels, transportation).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to condemn the indictment of the English press’s accusations “an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote” by the committee members.
"They're thrown out with dirt, they're trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States seems to be reinforced by the 1994 experience of being the logic favorites.
First Economic World Power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea that have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries that organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA hot-wanted permission of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will cause Asian chances to fall down to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, who had drawn all registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, as certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, might suffer from the weakness of television rights accumulated by the European countries (due to time shifting), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: awareness
De Gaulle had really tasted.
Mitrand had left him to believe he was stuck.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
Nicolas Sarkozy is less than that.
A mandate in Elysée calls for the next.
The current Head of State will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well faced on the side of the mystery that is attached to the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt is now.
In one sense, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, followers Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without themselves believing.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone his decision to “make the fall of 2011.”
That he would leave the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday night in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, had therefore a little feverity.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
It's a lot missing.
The President reminded only that the 2008 Constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a conclusion, no announcement.
It’s not the first time he mentioned the presidential elections on occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You've got seven and a half years with me in the worst case, or in the best place," he told them in July 2009.
A new thing in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday make him a candidate no more than the day before; but not less.
If you create comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which encourages many members of the PS earlier than accepted for fighting.
The poor surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidate by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%), according to the BVA-L’Express survey.
“We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded immediately and carefully.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
“He will always believe in being able to win,” corrects Alain Juppé, who has seen himself with awareness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state documents
The last meeting of the Central Bank Board of the ECB last year should provide opportunities to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to graduate at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European state debt is committed to the central bank in Frankfurt, undoubtedly, not to allow, even the today’s more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs would be too high.
French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday, on a press conference, the active role taken by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the European State Budget Debt.
She did not dare to say whether she believed the central bank could do even more, for example by increasing its programme of purchasing state bonds.
“I retain my considerations for my European trade partners (...).”
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown himself not very much speaking about his projects in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but rather satisfies to point out that the programme for purchasing state documents on the secondary market would be "widespread" and that we will look like decisions at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury Chamber were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretion of some traders, they were supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the dealers, no doubt is the anticipation of a further tracking of the purchase rate (see page 29).
People’s farmers are no longer expecting a remarkable change in prices.
If the bond transactions of over three months will have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still create full money reserves in a free way, for a period of one week to three months.
People’s farmers are already convinced today that this action will be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
“Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, Commerzbank’s owner.
“A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the state debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of obligations that lifts the tired market,” Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of state debt in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice other than to maintain its presence on the market.
“It has to come to the marketplace at any price of the lack of investors and act in such a way to prevent the rapid enthusiasm of returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bondholder said yesterday.
Because if interest rates apply to the high flight, states would be further prevented from reducing their debt or even merely stabilizing it.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi is in coverage in Italy
After a worrying week start for Italy, the situation has been a little relaxed yesterday with the decline in corner rates to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economics, the Chairman of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "unciferable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which however immediately denied the person.
On Tuesday, the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi told his ministerial council that Spain’s discrepancy is at 400 base points in German interest rates.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as "heavy worried" about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
This means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, falling tax inputs that put the state at risk to no longer be able to meet its funding needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the Senate budget for examination is expected to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the predicted by governments 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the revolt about a new budgetary collective, which could be used at a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
“Where necessary, new savings measures must be taken,” said auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
“The foundations of Italy’s economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who has been entrusted with Italy to the IMF.
“There are currently no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term perspective, as Italy despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) will require lower stability progress than other countries,” says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief People’s Officer.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face an application for distrust by the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized already at the end of March.
There is therefore a little favorable period for decision-making regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said, “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon as well as evening: the Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defend their currency and currency area.”
Although totally relatively - the decline of yesterday's interest feet of the European state bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot be discussed.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could decrease Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly loaded on the bank systems," explains the opinion of the popular farmers of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political time goes far slower than that of the markets.”
The European countries that are conscious of both this gap and the danger that is hidden therein are probably intensifying the discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and in a broad sense with their counterparts of the G20 are going well.
And this also in terms of the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the thread cross of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia-Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of his visit is not express fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first paper expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted Reuters, the United States supported a potential increase in funds mobilized by the additional direct engagement of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are committed to structural reforms, particularly in the field of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that will be added to the savings measures but will show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have gone a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other is at any cost to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they set up their own budget corrections and have decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them confidence back on a long time.
In turn, European investors talk about the available options to accelerate the normalization process of the public bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the passage in Paris on November 24, had first produced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to rebound its own pocket again.
Barclays Capital’s popular farmers, in terms of the market of the European government debt, judge that a renewal of the 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity spray.
This fund exists: the European mechanism of financial stability, which is currently €60 billion.
A advisory board that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions grow.
Snow and smoothness: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still track traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary traffic networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alarm level due to the threatening risk of snow and smoothness.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have come to the 20 departments already in Orange Alarm Stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshowers tang the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic impairments and affect certain economic activities, Meteo France predicts.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads for the heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes are locked, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who are able to use their own vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In Picardia school traffic has been cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be highly careful on the roads and to adjust their driving behavior."
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights starting from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall on Thursday.
The DGAB recommends that flight passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the traffic economy on Ile-de-France has been in full move, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we remember the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is designed to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the state has proclaimed a capital donation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give a portion of the financial sum on the markets twice.
Today, it finally came to the first invoices.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, this morning in view of the National Assembly Financial Commission, contains the planned measures to introduce the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax for growth and expansion and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The first, according to article 15 of the draft law, goes "along with the Société du Grand Paris public service".
“The product of this tax amounts to €117 million per year.”
Second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate tax: “to modernize it, to increase the product that comes from it and to deliver this increase in the Société du Grand Paris.”
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
“It is concluded that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation that are applied by the state and the Société du Grand Paris gradually performed for the project,” the statement said.
The SGP doesn’t find this system at all.
“Since the moment when you account for revenues (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover projection for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion,” he explained.
“This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted.”
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to rate the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billions promised will be able to look for long, is at risk of raising a rather moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racible hackers and empress spies
The affair WikiLeaks has twice meaning.
On one side, she has uncovered herself as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs the relationships between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a taste to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by an intelligence service (any x-nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits throw nothing but what you have got to read for months in any x-like journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly cartooned profile Gaddafis offered their cabaret artists for long fabric.
The rule, according to which the secret dossiers can only consist of known news, is essential for the dynamics of intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Graal, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosencruisers) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish research (and he did not know where news would be found about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
Equally the secrets.
The informant is poor, and poor (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (suggests he could be whatever, for example editor at Liberation), who only considers true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. embassy had sent to the Department of State in Rome, was the same as those who had published Newsweek the previous week.
So why was such a lifting done about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what each educated person already knows, and that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small tasks of representation, have turned into spionage centres.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very accurately, and it doesn’t happen because of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of falsehood and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Second: The idea that any x-hacker can attack the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the significant strike against the prestige of the Department of State.
Furthermore, the scandal brings less victims, rather than the "fathers" in trouble.
But let’s devote ourselves to the deep nature of what happened.
Formerly, at Orwell’s times, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subordinates.
Orwell’s prophecy had since been able to prove to be completely correct where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen motorway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you take attention to what happens today that even the secret cryptos of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control path stops being directed on one side and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a retaliator of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and a empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it means to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this destruction that has been added to such great power?
It is obvious that the states will not provide any more reserved information online in the future - that would equal to an adhesive attached to the road corner.
But it’s just as obvious that with the current technologies it’s worthwhile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relationships be maintained for certain ears and private in the future?
I know very well that my forecast sounds scientific and romantic at the moment, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agencies, moving secretly on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their communications anywhere differently than in mere memory, and besides the few written information they have received in the shoeberg.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: Watergate’s spionage attempt was basically less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing today like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrapher had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegrapher with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the movie researchers to watch a film band for band by spilling from back to forward and breaking all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today allowed nothing but to jump from chapters to chapters, i.e. in macroportions.
High-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including switching.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communication technology return on car and horse.
An ultimate observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
Currently, the messages demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifully speaks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called “Fast Start” or early financing) realized by developing countries.
And the gross French beautiful talks have already been discovered.
The Copenhagen Treaty committed developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion (i.e., 420 million a year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of their commitment to the fast-start financing: detailed approach report of its Member States, press conference, large ad-events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued for its actual value: the evolving countries and civil society would like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it on the right path towards respecting its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure an additional investment has been incurred without reaching the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the directional value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has elected itself as an orientation value for that of 2009: international funding will be maintained, and in the framework of the "Fast-Start" funding, 150 million for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar orientation values, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France believed that funding "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative values in the expenditures of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In particular, the overall sum of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France requires to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another, crucial element is dividing in donations and loans.
There is no rule, and everyone chooses its computing mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to respond: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often tied to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceitful to present the euro that is equivalent to a donated euro.
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million euros by earning 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and giving 8.5% loans) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans largely.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) comply with 100% donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfill its commitments, France only gives 10 cents and understood a similar commitment.
Beautiful hokuspokus!
Overall, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: in one part with a further development of the action over time and in the other part with the reality of the financial investment.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million “new and additional” million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once in the EU (why the other member states continue with the donations if it is enough to borrow?) and then in negotiations, as the evolving countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question for relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of UNFCCC.
Let's hope this won't be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year’s early funding.
First of all, France would be able to announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensation of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another, decisive and currently discussed issue): you cannot escape the question of the "precisibility" or the type of booking of your loans.
France could change its position to be as advanced with regard to questions as it is in other things.
The hope is based on the new Minister of Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “precisibility” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes various chemicals over day 81, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results “do not represent statistically significant value given the small number of analyzed samples, but rather represent illustration characteristics of the treated problems,” had bought between July and September the typically within four, from about a ten-year-old child consumed foods plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - have been studied as well as nozzles from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low-metering: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely cancer-driving and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disorder factor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical substance individually taken are not exceeded in the near-to-all cases, this survey is very well recognized that the reality in which the consumer is potentially exposed to cancer substances or substances with endocrinine disorder factor is worried."
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk contain more than ten of the potentially cancer-related residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including at lunch, where the study has found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the bowl, even the baguette and rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were spicked.
In the pipe water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues was the "most sufficient" and even the plastic stove used for heating the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "cocktail" for consumers "will probably be underestimated," the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, “in view of the urgency of the situation” to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the “augmentation of civilization diseases”.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
