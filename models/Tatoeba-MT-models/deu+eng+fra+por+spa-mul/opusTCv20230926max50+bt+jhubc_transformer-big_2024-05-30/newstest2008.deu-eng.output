Food offenses for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the rainfall was higher than expected in November - according to the 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, according to the EU’s statistical office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were estimated to be only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian bank of notes, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Leitzsins. According to its discretion, interest reduction would favor the rising raw material prices and the slight decline in unemployment the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB seeks to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least little at the two percent brand.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the Zwickmill: Inflation must be “delivered” in order to exclude later action needs.
With 3.3 percent inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in inflation in the eurozone is responsible for increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF grain ratings increased by 88%, and the soybean rate also reached a record high since 1973.
Even for food oil and dairy products, there was a significant fatigue in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased by 52% this year - the price per fish of black gold reached nearly US$100 last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts go from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect that the ECB will lower interest rates twice.
Gallup places government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly until the beginning of December. The party has the largest base camp since 2002, while the approval for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached a depth point of 13 percent.
The difference in the voters is significant thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are compared to a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry line: they reach two percent in the overall population.
The number of party voters has grown by 1% in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic mood has become further worse – never before the share of those who judge the country’s economic situation as “extremely poor” was so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent considers it “ pretty poor”.
After hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families again see the change of their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is from improvement.
A gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historical high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "better bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38%.
About 54% don’t trust the chief of government at all, compared to 27% mistrust against the partial chief of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think they might get to handle the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without changing government.
After the riots last October, 35% pronounced for the remaining of the government and the head of the government, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60% responded that they would “securely” participate, and another 20% would “probably” give their vote.
To compare, if parliamentary elections take place on Sunday, only 55% would go to the urns "with certainty," another 15% would consider their participation "probably".
74% would vote against school fees, 79% would vote against practice fees, and 84% would vote against hospital day money.
Referred to the group of participants in the referendum "with safety" the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89%.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
Hypermarkets in the Buddha’s trading area also retained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
The Buddha trading triangle has also increased the price of the usual Christmas basket of the Napi by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been "lopped up" last December, the fatigue has not fallen drastically percentage compared to the previously high starting level.
However, it certainly has a disturbing effect on consumers that what they paid for last year was far less than 9,000 HUF, is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical limits of 10,000 HUF by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and living fish remained almost to previous year levels, but prices for brush fillets, nuts and moths have risen strongly.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, in Auchan there were 1 kg of bread waking for 139 forint.
There was no competition-related price crash in the product at less than 200 forint.
Also surprisingly here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola package bottle of under 200 forint, so the drink included package cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" shopping cart compared Auchan is the most expensive, and Cora is the most expensive.
Our calculations have shown that Cora prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price rise was 1,480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was 1,206.00 Forint last year, but the VAT increase was noticeable at last Christmas prices.
It was precisely this procedure that trade has happened badly: apparently, the stores couldn’t decide what price range they should apply for each item, as the impact of price increase on consumption behaviour was inevitable.
(If the dealer poorly plans the circulation speed of a product, it can fall for substantial profits in the price range that is based on the traffic intensity.)
The rate of the "Napi" shopping basket in the past year fell radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was just 844 forint.
Such extremes were not observed this year, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630,00 Forint more than last year, and even the cheapest, there was a price rise of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price rise showed up, the price of daily consumption items in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office noted a more than 30 percent fatigue over the period of 12 months.
Besides flour and eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the last, since the price level of the expensive product already in the previous year has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is continuously reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer look at prices.
They are purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the shop tables.
On Wednesday morning, in all three stores, there were endless snakes at the cassa, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multiples complain from opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for foods, but also for sustainable consumption goods.
Many places are saved on disinfection agents
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to incorrect handling of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overlap of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not just affordable to remove infections, says the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, the disinfection agents are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria was found in a male patient who was entered into hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important surgery could not be carried out since then because of the bacteria still in the patient's body.
By December 10th of this year, the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System was reported from hospitals in 1094 by multi-resistant pathogens caused infections, Karolina Böröcz, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, said.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacyllin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about one-third of people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) react usually well to antibiotics, they are well healed.
However, if the agents are dosed too highly or applied incorrectly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria will arise from the well-responding bacteria that quickly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakening, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily life of the disease.
You cannot confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only not where it is not searched for.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samplings too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, though the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable to prevent the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant agent, says Karolina Börökz.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and age homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients involved and immediately isolate MRSA-infected.
However, microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state’s health insurance system for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore come to the daylight until the patient has already a notable MRSA infection, says the doctor head of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the agent can form, however, this directive of hospitals is not always observed.
Among the ambulants, or patients in basic care, microbiological samples are even less frequent, says Karolina Börökz.
Savings in the disinfection agents
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to the other from the nursing staff.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks has a significant importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient in domestic hospitals.
The rooms are even often overwhelmed, the beds are little ranked together, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters from an epidemiological point of view between them.
As Karolina Börökz continues to note, unfortunately, in the less financially well-established hospitals even comes to be saved in disinfection agents, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that just favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven much less common, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protection measures are observed, says Karolina Börökz.
Government programme against MRSA
To get MRSA infections in handle causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its restraint, was held in the government program.
After the first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant patogenes (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death Policeman was not drunk
In the case of a deadly car accident caused by the Head of Police of the XXII District, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Senior Attorney on Friday after the official opinion was submitted on the case.
The report confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he put himself on control.
The former chief of police entered the Kossuth Lajos street with his own car in the XXIIth district and has passed a 55-year-old man crossing the road at an unmarked location.
(However, StVO is not a mild circumstance - the driver has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, next.)
The pedestrian, after delivery to the hospital, is injured.
According to police reports, the leader suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor’s Office has initiated its investigation on the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Other 400 million EUR for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) have signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, worth EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The credit agreement over 100 million has already been signed earlier and the current agreement concerns the use of the awarded 200 million EUR.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the Loan Agreement is also intended to be invested on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the expansion of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting partners have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow in research and development programs at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the underground line 4 also came to speak.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and eventual modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-bound, and the loan is provided by the EIB with an upgrade of 8 years, provision-free.
Bulgaria, the EU Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe looks attentively at the Balkan state that was previously rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but will be quickly expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought after for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renners, however properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly demanded.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s interior is also attracting investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as Russian’s highly affordable area.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradise, and thus attract tourists in the summer and winter seasons also in the other two seasons.
Therefore, predictive investors already buy in great style now, for example around Bansko.
Analysts say people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their livelihoods.
Most buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle will either buy revitalized real estate by 50-100,000 euros, or dropped houses by 5-15,000 euros, which will then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are largely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group makes businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term value increase.
Properties in the capital are still becoming more expensive, depending on the constantly growing demand.
Within the EU, although real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, in the last five years there was a price increase by 21 percent annually.
The raging in real estate prices far exceeds the rise of wages.
Fodor and the six percent of Hungarian
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali schedule in which emission reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
Currently there is a heavy debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about specific figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on the support of developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be administered by a 16-headed Council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary 6%
Minister of the Environment, Gábor Fodor, supports Hungary’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection actions and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020 the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured to the values of 1990), regardless of whether the "agreement after 2012" will be successfully achieved or not, and that the Union would even be willing to comply with a 30 percent reduction provided other large industrial states in the world, or developing countries, are ready to fulfill their commitments fully and responsities.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the goal of the countries who joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU had already committed to a minimum of 8% with its 15 member states at the time.
Hungary’s requirement is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 – a requirement that the country will fully fulfil as to be read in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the re-emission reduction system laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by the international emission reduction system, with its recent importance, the IPCC, the international, with the UN peace nobel award excellent scientific climate change.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the rise of the Earth's average temperature by more than 2° C. would be inevitable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army Advertisement on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: specialist units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 launch videos on Taliban-led operations to the network, the BBC reports.
The miniature cameras rotated with helmets are controlled at the aircraft base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the internet.
Political Message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already taxed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defense headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Department of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the abroad operations.
Such propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television advertising, says defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always bear a certain degree of political embassy in themselves, as they confirm the permission of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also struggle with amateur recordings that, besides the carefully edited, censured recordings, also create it into the network, such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the most of the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the Iraq and Afghanistan war scenes, by the way, numerous videos have already been loaded onto the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gate".
The Americans, however, advertise in a bit different way, namely, with the free-download shooting game "American Army", in which the player can plunge into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lively simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Ministry of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is not at all strict: instead of a Christmas celebration, she holds a work conference where her employees can make 2007 sound with coffee and pogate.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, others magic Christmas atmosphere with tombola or stumbling in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held today at the defence resort, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by currently stationed soldiers abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides approximately 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport offer over the strings.
The 4.32 Mio Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola league.
The National Development Agency (NFU) held its expensive 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebrations on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (ILO), with concerts and a festivity.
The room rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for more than 400 guests invited.
According to our information, a NFU department is also invited at another Christmas celebration held by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vigszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the NFU guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On request from [origo], there was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Administration are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, officially invites her employees not even to a Christmas celebration, but to a conference on the annual sound.
It is expected to have about 180 guests who, according to the press department, are housed only with coffee and pogate, the celebration takes place with 350,000 forint.
Self-Administrative Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply start with his colleagues in the Ministry's class.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2,500 forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent boosts.
Since the beginning of the mandate of János Veres, the staff of the PM celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party immune — not only because of the official speech of the Minister but also because of the celebration of the afternoon.
On January 20th, the Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year’s Reception, this time the Ministry’s Christmas celebration is exhausted.
The one hundred guests are requested to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenditures are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple stance receipt, to which only accredited foreign diplomats are charged in Hungary.
The receptions that are organized every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the Minister and sounds with retardant mouses.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the foreign office nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked for the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to celebrate the Arts Commerce Museum.
More and more forces are mobilised for giant strike
The Union League and the Hungarian Union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday, on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act, the laying down of work begins.
It is expected to be strike-related, significant traffic impairments, as railway traffic is almost completely settled, and also the Budapest public transportation companies (BKVs) are striking by 13:00 a.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the Union League and the Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
It is also established a LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all organisations that have joined the strike will set up the work for indefinited time, unless agreement is achieved with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament’s vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
If the law is adopted, however, the strike committees will come together to advise on further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight, there will be a vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes beginning on Monday will have to be expected to have significant traffic impairments: the railwayers put down their work for indefinitely, in the morning most of the public transportation is still, and more than half of Volán societies.
At the same time, there will be highway locks in many places of one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civilian organizations - the list of participants is continuously updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes for indefinite time, others plan a temporary lack of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was still no agreement between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the railway VDSZZZ on sufficient achievements, although more and more people are traveling on the train just about the Christmas holiday.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from start up to 3 p.m., at Budapest Airport strikes between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy put down the work for four hours, and the teacher trade union has called for 2- or 2-8 hours strikes.
The Hungarian physicians’ association strikes alterning across the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Services, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government takes back the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the step-by-step introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the claimed professional groups will be enabled to access the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the Liga trade unions has not accepted the offer concerned by the Ministry of Transport submitted by the sidelines and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Department of Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute’s “Risk Warning Report” states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents “the exacerbation of the existing ethnic tensions between the citizens and non-citizens in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic intersections in a short term”.
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard strategy, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is considered as a failure by the political responsible: “People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups that have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary approach.”
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, encourage extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of domestic and foreign media, “have significantly damaged Hungary’s image abroad, especially regarding confidence in stability and democratic maturity.”
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has continued to rise, so several organizations called "national self-defense association" have been founded since summer 2007.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly boast to prepare their members - sometimes armed - to defense tasks (defense of disasters, country defense, order handling), with the inaccuracies of the police, the army, or the state itself," he said.
And further: Everything happens according to that method that attempts to deal with different political and party-based efforts as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the association, therefore, is not merely a function of the movement of legal obstacles that could arise during the registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As we see in the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are an increased risk factor for relationships with neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been quoted in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, according to some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
“This all has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard has not been a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Right Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard, the Roma mass exhaustions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has equally taken the incidents for the founding of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization of “national protection” is.
Indeed, he believed that in the past 17 years, Bulgaria has been a real “zigeuner terror” noticeable, but the state remained unwilling and indifferent – so political capital.
And furthermore, the initiative would have started a heavy debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also proven by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Romas, with the organization of their own protection, also respond to the threats, says the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if risk-changing tendencies should be recognizable, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Feasts are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are accurately regulated by law, so the practice of redisposing the working days has now established around the holidays, but the next year offers us less of these days.
In the EU and America, something else is known as “Feast Day”.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and labour-free days.
Workless days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are labour-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year’s celebrations can rest.
We have a total of fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The state celebrations are the 15th March, which reminds the Revolution of 1848, and the 23th October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the establishment of the state, on May 1st, the work will be celebrated, on November 1st and 2st, we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of “workday displacement” has been proven in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before it, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally worked out, has long been established by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation.
The law applies equally to all employers and employers, public employees and public service officials.
Except only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. even on holidays.
Heuer is only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in this country remains formal, since most of them take time balance for the days between Christmas and New Year’s Day, or the holidays that are removed for it.
The next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redispositions on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work "on the head", so that people can stay at home just four days at the piece.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2th, can be a rest day.
The second redeployment is related to the holiday on October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work on Friday, October 24 in advance.
However, the end of the year will be unrestlessly in the sign of the holidays after everything leaves and remains from December 24, even if New Year’s falls on a Wednesday.
Six disturbing little things to annoy colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive - harmless lies that no longer remember us: they bring "color" to the daily workplace.
The question is just whether you get used to these small discomforts, or better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood situations consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to direct you that someone called from the marketing department," a colleague says.
That you missed a meeting?
If best, you regret it and try to make it well again by perhaps calling and repentfully admitting at the marketing department, you would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less usual method).
Usually the thing is dismissed with an excuse.
Before you get stuck in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how to make your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Do you borrow something that doesn’t belong to yourself?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than you call a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the lift was still on the desk - it's gone today early?
Or is the lost pen believed to be discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, nothing should be borrowed from colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So, no cuverts or post-it put out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit one self: no more there if you need it.
Colleagues’ private life?
There is no effective means to stop a trap already placed in the world.
Who with whom, what did you do?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the personal life of colleagues should not be bound to the nose of anyone if possible!
And if someone opens up and gives us his inner secret, we should not misuse that confidence!
It is better to silence like a grave, instead of aligning those not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick without reason?
When you call in the office to report on painful headaches because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one: your own work, irrelevant conclusions, projects with fixed dates now have to do colleagues instead of yourself.
Don't play badly with colleagues!
If you already know that the next day you will not get to the office, or that something could happen in between, why you need to stay at home, you should report it on time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summary, Kickers, Call
You’re just deep in your work, but you’re suddenly disturbed by the noise of the colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone talk that you shouldn’t have heard better?
You shouldn’t nerve colleagues with summons, singing, sounds of conversations (which are led over their heads), trampling, continuing blasphemousness or worms.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they aren’t deep in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you shouldn’t be excused about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to acknowledge your mistakes, and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to correct the error, or the failure, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training trousers and slippers: Comfortable for home, but nothing lost in the office!
Not even then, you should dress up so leather if it would actually be allowed to the workplace!
Just don’t get too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress up in the office accordingly - if you want, also beautiful and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go-traffic, the car in the middle of the morning storage.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a cheek, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel comes a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The domestic music scene hasn’t just spoiled us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the stack differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene, slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage cloak with its guitar kit is again "in", the domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, musicised himself in the band Yonderboi before he – perhaps because a host house does not tolerate two peppers – began to walk his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which blends elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he managed to make it until the request to compose the soundtrack to a film had approached him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially occurred in smaller clubs, became known to the broader audience only when the magazine "wan2" ran its first album in 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, to be the only trend set that was also marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but none were interested in whether they liked to wear this brand too.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying attachment would also be fine, however, in addition to the essential character of the music, the pure guitar that corresponds to the time spirit and trends, the influences of the rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the Millennáris premiere.
A song from the album has even succeeded in the radio striker - who from early to late pop music sending mr2 Petőfi has set the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), successively the earworm.
It's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked for Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much for me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seamless and no saying, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The readiness to receive the listener also works independently from languages and country borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially west of us.
There are not only teens or twins going to concert, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentive because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience come to in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many you listen to your music?
B. E.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
We have never composed for the market.
In us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn only in the inaccurable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: If you want to do it right to everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a solist and has built his career in the West.
E.g.: We don’t really go their way, even though you’re always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as a team player who rely on the musical presence of others and can develop themselves.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work were inevitable with that of Yonderboi, as many of us came from his band and got another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi is "Wings of Love" in the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously scened with a little more popular style towards a broader audience?
E.g.: We had no plans to write a hit that should then be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought as the final of the album we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Z.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
Thus, the six-headed choir - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you have the song likewise, or did the girls shape it?
For example, the number was in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number "it needs something else".
The accord sequence has formally requested a vote of sang.
I sang the melody on the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on anchor and scary spontaneously.
I can remember that I was quite electrified at the time, but it needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, they had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, singing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They stood on the stage too.
Is it intentional?
B.Z.: That they stood behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we consciously did not want to give them a solo roll.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who came from and where it is, let’s just allow us to raise these specific wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most comprehensive song?
E.g.: In the musical creation work there has been nothing, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concertclaver, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has joined together, as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
This changes with the concerts and also now when I’ve left the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of low-value feelings
Soilless scammers
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the named Komerční banka.
She came for him for nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather like that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it right away from his colleagues, and it was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's rather mentally weak," heard from the mouth of his supervisors who showed him at the police.
But as evidenced by the statements of Kerviels, which the French media published, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had earned earnings of €1.6 billion at the end of last year with his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his statement.
In the summer he was able to earn half a billion euros just in the American crisis.
He had been looking forward to this opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime hypothecs, such as weak income customers or those who had earlier problems with payment, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an influence on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had earned up to €1.6 billion.
“When I deserved the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Ker admits and continues to say he definitely kept nothing for himself.
During the entire interrogation he acknowledges that he has counterfeited documents so that one can't get him to the scarf.
He even managed to keep his boss behind light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Did he be afraid of flying?
It's hardly.
“I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew he will never earn as much as others.
“When my first talk in 2005, I knew that I was watching.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigator.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the Alliance’s shares, he earned a lot by setting half a billion euros on price losses in the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make profit, we leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police officer.
But the boss supposedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I earned money, I closed my eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they come to him?
He suspected himself for a holiday.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a holiday is one who doesn’t want to look at him in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes that the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros in the coming years (about 365 billion crowns).
It is about half the sum that Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprises and Innovation program.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of traffic.
The traffic programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transportation Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprises and Innovation program aims to serve entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds to innovative businesses.
This aims to gain funds for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous EU fund acquisition, Czech Republic is among the new Member States one of the least successful to date.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year prison penalty for presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold German, to which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda in the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) this Middle American state comes back behind grids, it is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether Germany is left to put his penalty at home, or whether he has to be in prison.
A court reported four years ago that Germany had regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money finally landed in a fund that German had established to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's gone.
The state budget is approved.
What is special in this budget?
It is the first budget that the government has designed and was adopted without support of the opposition by the majority of the coalition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because he had submitted Minister Sobotka (by this party), and ČSSD was therefore unable to refuse him.
Unlike the vibrant debate before the vote on the mistrust motion against the government, this time no dramatic happened.
The House of Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary
This is somehow paradox.
Everything governs begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one likes it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is hidden by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from past social-democratic governments under three weaknesses, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high share of expenditures that are mandatory by law, not only with pensions but also with social expenditures that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficiency of budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction lies in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors gave, except income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, more sources of investment, often unconsciously debt debt by which they overdebt their councils.
In recent years, they managed to remove these debts by massive sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already dropped.
Insofar as we only keep ourselves with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For a few years, our economy, like the rest of the world, has gone through a growth phase, the ČSSD boasts itself without ceasing.
This was a unique way for their governments to arrange public finances.
Instead, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge harm that is mainly to be attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, seen globally, are at least threatened to poverty.
Therefore, no massive social programs are needed, unfortunately, which have been overwhelmingly inflated in a gigantic extent just over the past few years.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating some of the insense populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a displacement of the retirement age and a pension reform, practically any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power will remain nothing but purely managing it.
It is only easily overwhelmed to say that then from ruling politicians became officials who mechanically divide the majority of tax income on pensions and social expenditures.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the extrusion of normal expenditures through mandatory expenditures.
The deficit of 70 billion crown planned for 2008 would be quite unnecessary if previous governments had not spent over the past decade, which was just going.
If we do not really want to become pure administration officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees to wish to rest in preparing further reform laws.
Only these enable progressive enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
Therefore, more than $100 billion in auctions will be reached on the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks are offering interest rates to which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion on auction, further 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks on 11 September that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to defending or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, which is the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can give," Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report for his customers from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unexploited loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
“Central banks must have really been afraid of whatever can happen when they decided to do this,” said ABN Chief Economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drop the American economy into a recession, possibly impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided, after they failed, to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank Rate, which is used for leasing money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, and that even though central banks in the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during autumn.
“This will have the same effect as another lower interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting at Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes allegedly harm the most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed herself on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end-to-end UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he showed that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government representatives and such of non-governmental organizations, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that it accompanies and the reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework that is only replacement for a real solution to current problems,” said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized in the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him, and that he was therefore so committed to this.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
Now interested people could read his attitude undistortedly.
Klaus reminded him that he was not a climateologist, but he believes he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is finally a scholar, capable of understanding and judging professional treaties, having experience with statistics and also being an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, there is no coherent opinion among scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore are no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and effective.
Furthermore, he considers it as a person who has experiences with totalitarian systems to be unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he considers it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from the present, he repeatedly declared that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take attention to the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence until the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the roads without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, they did not replace their driving licence primarily those who no longer want to drive.
While small places report a strong decline of interest in exchange, the capital offices are overwhelmed with applications, and the interest in exchange is growing this week.
The city administration delivers around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140000 drivers have not replaced their driving license yet.
The exhibition will take a new driving license for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driving license threaten a fine from January.
The criminal pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also use it with an admonition in the transgression.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, the person can also receive a penalty from the municipality who does not drive at all.
He could, as said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to leave gentleness and impose a fine of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one threatens a thousand-crown punishment.
The driving license is a document where everyone can decide whether or not he wants to own it.
It is not about a card that everyone, including a valid, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driving license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent community office or to send him there by writing.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers have to gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years of time for exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court reduces punishments for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of making a joint thing with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 years or 10 years in prison.
This decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Upper Lands Court, which reduced its punishment by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the fight against organized crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, he first has the initial judgment.
However, in other cases, he had received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to more.
In January, a district court spoke guilty to 19 people especially for participation in robberies, the Upper Lands Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused disputed the charge from the beginning with the reason that it is a constructed case.
According to the Middle Bohemian District Court, members of the police delivered information from police sources in consultation with Berdych criminals, covered various robberies, and helped members of the bands to escape law enforcement.
The bands left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The charge is about crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for official assumption and unlawful weapons possession.
In case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, steel core ammunition, a laser target remote tube and a machine gun.
According to the accusation, the bands have enriched many millions of crowns by their robberies.
Except for almost 20 men in this proceedings, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others legitimately than guilty for other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to be responsible for another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
So far, the main trial has escaped Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for legal prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a child’s clinic, the attorney of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, will require 12 million crown compensation from the hospital in Třebíč plus judicial costs.
For each of the mothers three million per day, for the fathers two million per day and for the children one million per day.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent pair.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not entirely agreed with the Velebas proposal.
“We reject such a proposal, it’s too high for many times,” Dostál said after today’s trial.
“But in order to make an opinion about this counter-suggestion, we need the opinion that the counter-side made.
We will determine whether it has any statement value.
But we insist that this should be in the area of hundreds of thousands together for all," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation negotiations, an opinion that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had developed for him.
Children's parents suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth, according to psychological and psychiatry professionals.
The men defeated the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves faced with allegations that they could have prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, deal with the effects of the experienced trauma worse, as well as what is currently happening, Veleba summarised the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged birth nurses in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
District head of Vysočina (Bohemian-Mernical Altitude) delivered 100000 crowns to each family at the end of October as a replacement for expenditures created to them by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital under the district.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they must reach a reserve fund; only exceptionally, they can apply for assistance to the carrier.
The courts have so far granted relatively low damage compensation sums to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his Kingdom Wallachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute for the brand "King Wallachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in many years.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, this is probably not finished and his client will probably appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to take part in the popularity of Bolek Polívka’s parasitics,” said attorney after the trial of Polívka.
All of them presented in the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comic.
The same opinion is Harabiš.
“We have nearly ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute for money.
“After years they noticed that the project is successful and that they might have something of it.
They want to win parasitics on our work,” he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not then agreed with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of spending Wallachian passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallised out to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to his owners when visiting his farm and theatre presentations.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also today indicated that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the shipment "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polívkas popularity has safely helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today’s disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes began to grow between Polívka and Harabiš, which summed up in the deposition "King Boleslav I elected until the Saint-Nimmerleins-Day".
The leadership role then assumed Harabiš’s Jarmila Šulaková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka and his company filed the lawsuit today by the court.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
This is why a new king should come out.
Details and an appointment he didn’t want to tell.
“We don’t want to hurry.
It should be something like the royal movement in the Wallachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Preferences go down
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much worthwhile, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be referred to as a lower average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combo with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just remain to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic 207 Hatchback, I had to complain about the too low freedom of head on the rear seats.
These complaints are now no longer, because the body of the combo is designed so that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Quickly Continue
I just go through the interior equipment shortly to not repeat too much.
It is a fairly successful design where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or head supports.
Side content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
As for the space offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
In the combi, the previously mentioned lack of freedom of header has also been eliminated.
Suitcase in the bagroom
The main thing in this car is the charging room.
I have to call it (also because of the folding back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The hollow rooms are equipped with holding belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let them separate and also hold heavier items.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains clearly 52 litres.
For a foreign holiday or when inviting a baby car, this value is already critical.
But to emphasize the positives, I still have to mention the fully flat charging space after the rear seats beveled or even the very low charging edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a 1.6-liter lift space and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should look like a 1600 cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes appears as if his exhaust was stopped with a lap, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just popular.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still attained.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is once again with 80000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disk cleaner, electric window lifters and...
The car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but once you expect the additional equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only remains the decision which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools failed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears towards the further development of local schools.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans has hit a number of obstacles.
British schools even determine cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is properly illustrated by North Kent, where the disputes between local and Slovakian immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, shikanes and rappers among students have been relied on the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovakian woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself with the insult of the boy with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene on a Slovakian immigrant after a two-year-old girls attack.
The girls had supposedly made racist comments to the man and advertised him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he warned us with apples and pears and then unweared his vest," a mother of the Slovak student of The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly stressed.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks came here on job search.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with kitcheners offering pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find it in a wide range.
Only on an island you can find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye ever saw.
Havana was once converted into a camp or through camps of treasures that the Spanish had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was created entirely at the end of the 20th century.
Building it to one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was regarded as a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was enjoyed to be seen and supported in Cuba – drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the broad boulevards, cars that were one of the cult symbols of the fifty years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanna, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails for you as desired.
And the culture cars of the fifty drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported shigulis and fiats in the salty and moist air have long broken down.
Havana, especially its oldest part, has fallen heavily, nowhere in the surrounding area you can find as many wonderful colonial attractions as just here.
Other places are just cleaned out, for example, Trinidad.
In terms of the fact that tourism brings money very needed, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar tube from remote plantations brought steam and same-driven narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their park has not been renewed for decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives whose ages have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places are not leaving the majority of visitors to Cuba.
This is how you no longer have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Remember only that there is a museum in the above-mentioned property of Hemingways, whose visits should not be left away from the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone floor.
The Mogotas, calky hills, and rocks, rise steeply from the valley, in their cavities, fertile soil was collected, through which also wittered rocks are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that there was the Chilean consequence of the television series "Major Zeman".
Trinity
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the muggy beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is so remote place that there was no road there yet in the fifty years of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the land.
This isolation helped to keep it unaware.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was broken down, everyone was happy that he had a roof above his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not silence until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba some call the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there by Guantánamo have to overcome high and crushed mountains and run through a landscape hardly touched by human interventions.
This eastern preposition of Cuba, UNESCO, thanks to the untouched nature there, took place in its World Heritage Directory.
There is the best chocolate made, the church shows the Cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several tafel mountains, of which El Yunque is the most known.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra Mountains, Pig Bay and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patronate Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, could be written many pages.
But, as you say, better look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Too little soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States’ course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not pass according to their ideas, in Scottish Edinburgh, representatives of countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on it.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among allies.
While the United States by its defence minister Robert Gates urged NATO units to be more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is enabling inhabitants to start their own developments in the economy and security,” says BBC’s British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest for five years.
The number of violence actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one-quarters in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute boundary with regard to the organization and equipment of units.
In particular, they demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
Similarly, today, NATO Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, said.
“I’m not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety-nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved in the last few months, there is also dispute about whether all allies in Afghanistan do their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers a faulpell.
"Afghan non-stuer: Germans play games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt speeds up to a billion in 2009
Each Czech is a debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt itself this year with 159.2 billion cones.
In early December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic’s state debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is a blame of 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may be going to exceed the boundary of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, Patria Finance analyst, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, an analyst of the Next Finance, says: “We could be able to exceed a trillion over the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation on the political stage changes, and the politicians should be ready to save more, this could last until 2010.
But I don’t go out of such a change,” he noted.
Debt grows
The debt of the state is based on the debt of the state government and is primarily based on the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury instructions, state bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt this year has increased to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable debt reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and dropped by 13.7 billion since June.
The average expiry of the state debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is recorded especially in the debt securities, where the growth is 20%.
It’s bad that the debt rises, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and dealing with the public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to take up 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
In early December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount comes primarily from the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is a maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion pension reserve, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion, and bonds rates for the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be beaten.
After parents complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old basic school teacher who was working at the Unity High School in Khartoum was taken home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam according to article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school director Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself had no shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well, and she never had done anything that could bring her close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his view is just an innocent mistake.
One opinion sharing many teacher's students who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
The first name Muhammad is also the second name given in the UK, for which there are 14 different types of writing in English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you, for example, give it a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion meeting in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not agree on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintaining peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
There are no violence acts expected in the immediate future, but we stand at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the mediations on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet on Monday for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of 90% of the Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika last August received the order of a new mediation from the United Nations.
Americans and Europeans are expecting their mediation order to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s independence in the Security Council, continue negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains a negotiated solution, an agreeable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the management of the United Nations for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision as the only solution with the future.
Pristina is prepared to announce this one-sidedly if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade is increasing autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, Kosovo’s President of the Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, on his own, believed that a compromise is always to strive, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a province’s unilateral independence declaration.
Belgrade says it is especially a "domino-effect" in a region that is still so much weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the rows of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They have to end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists answered Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word regarding the status, and added that every single-sided declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population will take place in council with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which had gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians were finally agreed on a joint statement.
He continued to explain that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush declared, reminding the two parties of their commitments in terms of the schedule for peace, which they had agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas finally seek a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that the disputes between Israel and Palestinians focus primarily on: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict, which lies in today’s state of Israel.
Following the American president, Abbas took the word and urged that the upcoming negotiations will be fully and thoroughly conducted and provide a regulation for all points, including he counting Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word, he committed himself to directly and without interruption the coming arms negotiations and to strive to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia announced that Bush has received Bush’s assurance in this sense before decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken over by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a pathway in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arabic prince said in his interview with the Arabic newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, police officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are faced.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, a police car on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no commitment, but was on strip, and driven at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a spokesman told the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, that is, not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, attacked at very high speed.
It rolled the left side of the police car, after it disregarded its progress from the right, a police officer continued to declare.
Alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (beautiful coat wing, split windshield, broken shot bar) testifys to the weight of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the Attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she entrusted to the IGPN an investigation on the "facts of involuntarian person murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in consultation with Val-d'Oise's main revision for public security.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the police responsibility of IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police officers, that this small power wheel has gone relatively quickly to their left.
Yesterday showed a kind of rims, certainly caused by the friction of the foot races on the ground that the two vehicles had remained inhacted to each other until the cops managed to brake it.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obducted yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor made the round, according to which the police had left the accident location very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious mistakes concerning this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which is necessary for further investigations, and which is very careful.
Libération has hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my kiss, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw an entirely disturbed policeman hitting.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth phone calls.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the happening and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had arrived at the accident location were taken in the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived approximately twenty minutes after the police departure.
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces had not helped the young people.
These young people were first helped.
The firefighters came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor emphasized.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since then two days earlier the emergency state was announced by General Musharraf.
According to witnesses, around 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the emergency state were infringed by the tear gas granates that the law enforcement forces in Lahore, in the east of the country.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the attorneys of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of oppositional, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have been found in Multan (Middle) and Peshawar (North-East).
On Monday, the lawyers movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency state, and the waste that made an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special action announced Saturday evening.
He had to take a position in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf’s reelection in a direct election course on October 6th.
Chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced by his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the army's supreme command and become a civilian president no longer applies since the emergency appeal, Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Vice Minister of Information has also confirmed that January elections could be postponed.
Furthermore, the Pakistani government denied the rumors that remain in the country, according to which President Musharraf had assigned a place of residence from his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies is not planned.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that allowed the contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which found that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of prevention has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
With one of five couples even accurately calculated a month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed it was organized with, and the tools based on the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts discharged the Harmony module from the Discovery space ferry, a large cylinder-shaped part that soon will take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy power generation module over solar panels already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew turned to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span width is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors left out of age like accordeons was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of approximately one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
The astronauts, who initially left the space ferry Discovery for a control path, then should repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the repair at the end of the 30-metre-long remote arm of the space ferry that was set to the station.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor learned was chosen to operate the injured solar panel.
After examining the damage accurately, he separated the defective cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who remained near the slope, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electrical blow on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station planned and built.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space ferry to expect to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS is sanctioned on the exchange
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to counter the remains of the A400M, the EADS share currently shows a significant decline on the Paris stock exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to check its business forecasts for 2007 once again, referring to the residues caused by the slowly advanced development of the A400M engine that delay the aircraft’s virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft range between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus, the European manufacturer’s mother group EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBITs) for Thursday for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly outcomes, he added without further details.
The group also states that the estimation of the new costs is related to the residue of six months.
To remember that the EADS’ business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, essentially due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting in the counting of the urns: the mass of the Russians will opt for President Putin’s Party, Joint Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast to the public broadcasters to the voters who have already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing this in his property as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Crem party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the president had nothing to look at when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new point of attack against the western powers accused of intervention—his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hopefully honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone down there.
She lamentates a campaign polluted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to five days of imprisonment for unlawful demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions are raised:
Who will take Putin’s succession as President?
The newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election course of the presidential elections, on 2 March 2008; candidates have a time to become known until 23 December.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot take a third consecutive mandate.
Now there is no successor.
What will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of the Parliament and of the All-Powerful Party United Russia, which will choose the government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the parliament elections or in the presidential elections, the power to date will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not lord of their fate, says the sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Koposov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: The bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again attached to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, the more, since this new paternalism did not follow a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, said Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians renounce their personal responsibility shortly after the USSR’s decay.
Why do you think for a long time?
This phenomenon relates to all society layers, including the business world.
And the administrative officer understands to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) run the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think long?
Those who are in power aren’t so bad, why do they dismiss?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intent, i.e. individually and named, that is, on request of a former victim or his family.
The eleven states commissioned with their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these named documents available to the public, due to the delicate character of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical reason: finding civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly providing proof of their arrest, in order to make them the way to their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 feast employees work out tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new in these documents should be expected, said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
Reciprocal trade between India and Europe is currently reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Southeast Asian Nations Association (Asean).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trade partner in the EU.
A free trade pact will enormously advance the two economic spaces and India will improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most commonly exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued to declare. Asian and European giants exchange of goods worth 47 billion euros annually and services worth 10 billion euros, this week Daniele Smadja, President of the European Commission's Decree of New Delhi, said to be eighth diplomatic Manso at the President of the European Commission in New Delhill.

The Bank of England takes note of concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned on Thursday about reducing the current recurring concern about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
In order to alleviate the fears that the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater certainty about how they can organize their liquidity positions during this time, the bank has the intention to give a significant part of its savings in a five-week-market during the conservation phase, which begins on December 6th.
The bank continues to explain that on December 6, GMT will be brought around £10 billion (14 billion euros) in circulation, to the basic tax rate and only by January 10.
This is apparently the first time the BoE runs liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Notice that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different rates of interbank lending rates from day to day with its basic rate.
Different interbank interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has increased to 6.6%, somewhat higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums brought in circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees, which had prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate unlike the euro, many intended to sign for the sums in circulation by the European Central Bank to be more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist legislation on purchasing power, which is equal to a denial of the text.
The text created in the framework of a socialist niche (session on initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated approximately ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which 50% on the employment supply, the re-introduction of the TIPP floating, to a transport check or to limit the rentals.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered a partially violent change of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s TV contribution on the purchasing force.
Jean Marc Ayrault, leader of the PS Members, announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the financial correction legislation that had been reviewed last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honour for our company to work with a person who has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place on August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn as co-owner also takes care of production, license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been in, says his company and Melvin Benn’s company work parallel to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and work with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we remained in political debates about current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, after it has been in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to earn $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax rates.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, while ours are rather held on the urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
"It's the goal of merging these two concepts in one way or another, in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban manner in the American way."
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that hopefully will have a long lifetime."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is “very big” in about 80,000 people according to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator is opposed.
These lock trials belong to the delegate tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, complains "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are cheap, you will go there.
“Our role is to offer those who are considered the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment the introduction of the cinema there is the highest priority.
The hunt for the Oscars began.
At all festivals on the west coast, even though that of Sundance, from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, rating them and making sure the producers will have interviews.
The dark age had a successful presentation at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the exchange a final year rally in advance? Discord with experts due to the U.S. hypothecal crisis
With almost five weeks until the annual accounts on the stock exchange, investors already grind their hands in terms of the coming final year rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically considered, the month of December on the stock exchange usually accompanies a positive market development.
Nonetheless, it is not advisable to create short-term forecasts and only based on statistics. Especially not if tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market happenings
Although other experts do not accept such a strong increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure stock funds, which is significantly affected by the value-run trend to yield assets.
Accordingly, these experts believe that the exchange will have a rather lateral rate trend affected by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot estimate the dimensions of the possible decline in the US NCB interest rate, an uncertainty that is primarily due to the rising raw oil price and the danger of increasing inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce a coming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest brand on November 8th of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional funds, each year in this period.
However, the expert points out that this year things could evolve somewhat differently, especially due to the final year rally already in the second December week, and then immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation from index values soon, whose dimensions defer from the consequences of the U.S. hypothecal market crisis.
The analyst trusts that they are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new highest levels, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney says that this year’s great values are in line.
Among the value winners the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied in connection with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually happens, real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on recovery course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert said.
With regard to increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only declined in two cases.
When the technology blade broke out in late 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year-end rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether in 2008 the fifth-profit year in a row (Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally, it will show.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economical regions of Spain.
For the institute operating under the brand name Popular Max, these branches are a big milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first bank group, dares to extend the opening hours of its stores on the week to 20.30h and apply Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The bank group BBVA, which also reads repeatedly the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made any definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem to target an agreement where 75% of all shops will be concluded on Saturdays and open to this on a week afternoon, although not for the customers.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting to business opening hours will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And that’s also the intent that Popular follows with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, can capture the shopping customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time equating them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is linked to a new space design of the stores, characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The responsible banking representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require larger investments, but was associated with an increased staff setting, as a subsidiary needed no longer six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept on nine firms in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, said Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the Bravo Murillo streets, O’Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a smart decision.
Popular currently leads approximately 2500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants and also have expanded opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The BBVA model is not used in these PopularMax stores as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have agreed to sell mobile phones by means of external bank personnel.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its exchange value for the first time and thus overcomes its rival Antena 3.
We've got it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the exchange. The broadcast managed by him had increased his value by twice the value of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, deterred his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He emphasized that, despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deeply.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a plus of 2.54 percent.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches €4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento participating only at 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, thus its market value amounting to 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other exchange-noted communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, at Prisa (editor of the Cinco Días) to 2,518,53 million, and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question seems uncertain to what extent we can actually act in exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco declared his plan to rise this year’s first television station with more than 1,000 million gross income from advertising revenues, assured by Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the TV business could only have an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better exchange rate compared to the high payout ratio, which the company could have until now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría led a 100% dividend compensation.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of Endemol shares, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even though we have always indicated much more so far.
I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the consequence of the cut of the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the estimated profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective performance and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both stocks.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (purchases) measures a more beneficial position than Antena 3 as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: Recommends to reduce expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agreed to the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary development, which today concluded its meeting with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the proposals for additional amendments associated with the project, the Government published the provisions arising out of the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate members who had pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible regime that ensures investor security and regulates each entrepreneur’s activities to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to modernizing the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the securities service regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, increased control requirements of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal entities to provide financial advice and contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies that join the investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that regulated circulation markets will add the multilateral systems of the effects of the business and the systems for the internationalization of trade orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law requires investment companies to demonstrate the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and ways of dealing with risks on the market, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task to the CNMV.
The Economic Commission of the Congress later considered further changes, with the decision that the title-owned debt must now be considered complex financial resources due to its high risk level for the investor, which has been confirmed by the U.S. hypothecal and banking crisis.
Furthermore, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of diplomated economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation was adopted, which was limited to the areas of work reserved for economists.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, as the Economic Mediator who works on a foreign account does not require authorization on the part of the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and simultaneously gain customers multiple investment companies.
The Harmonised Consumer Price Index (VPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The Eurostat indicator to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aspire to a local and quality comparison to U.S. products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be created early by using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information not existing at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) advised that the early identified indicator should only serve as an oriental value, and therefore not agree with the final outcome, which will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic and Finance Pedro Solbes, the rise in the VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the Monetary Union had remained more or less the same in recent years.
In addition, he explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in terms of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have dropped by more than half after the bank had crisis-related mid-September last year the UK bank asked for an emergency loan, and it now only amounts to £12,000 (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At this point, the bank’s assets amounted to record £25,000 million, a sum that has been significantly declined within two and a half months due to customers’ confidence loss and even despite the 100% guarantee of the government that the money is safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
The Virgin company, which would continue to lead the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, needs to bring about a quarter of the income of the UK banks coming up there from the investments of the next three years to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of the multimillioner Richard Branson, known for his notable advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to flow 50,000 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police today arrested the current mayor of the Totano (Partido Popular) city of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption, which was discovered this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Totana municipal council, and could be the original wire drawer of the complot, according to the broadcaster Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Cities Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban building corruption discovered early this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged deputy, Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving the residence of his client because of major loading documents that should be related to the complot.
Furthermore, other sources of information report from the alleged order payments Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, in case of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense, José Bono, has adopted the offer by President and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will present the list of PSOE candidates at the coming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, the office of the Congress Prime Minister.
José Blanco, the organisational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero today held in the party’s headquarters.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to rely on the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the politician from the Mancha would seem to be the president of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who last 15 November announced that he would no longer engage in the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and instead engage in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president had continuously urged him to return to political events.
Furthermore, he noted that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics, did not want to refrain from citizens who would take over the posts of the Congress-President in the event of a victory, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he actually takes over the office, he hopes to convert the Chamber into a House of Respect and not of insult or crying, in order to make it look more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, you gain the impression that the only place where you cannot speak in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once and 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work, and suggested that he does not want to raise the appearance of having already taken over the office, because otherwise his political counterparts would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate, both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate on this issue, undergoes an unmerciful criticism, the movement must put a strong cohesion on the whole.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, like in the case of the President of the Government Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, puts him in declaration of the action or non-trading of his government, which has decisively contributed to the lead of Spain within the EU of the countries that have at least met the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for the failure to fulfill the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to demonstrate to the Spanish citizens the measures he intended against climate change without swivel.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures to be implemented and the economic consequences thereof.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
It’s just because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE proposed fuel cent Zapatero appeared strategically so dangerous that he saw himself forced to take the proposal back.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician must neither speak nor accuse nor call for electoral campaigns, but instead must carry out the challenging issue to decorate the meetings and to enthusiast others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not claim that the bicycle will be the only means of movement in the future, or we can only refresh with a subject.
The mayor and police chief of Totana because of a supposed interference into a city-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Murcia’s Totana village, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the mayor’s secretary, and a hotel entrepreneur have been taken in detention because of the suspected urban violations.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who were also entered in the city administration and municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of an uncertain building ground for urban construction projects under the management of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be redesigned illegally.
Furthermore, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation proceedings which were initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigations, it is also identified against former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his former wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are suspected.
Chairman and holder of the Nuaria Group, the Vigo-born attorney and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose companies operate as a Nuaria subgroup and received the lubricant money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, made eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known regional poultry industry, who is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia-belonging village, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of area in Totana, which was intended to rebuild, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes further companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking places of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of buildings.

Our Finnish correspondent explains yesterday's commentary in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the note published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; randomly on that day, the issue of which the criticism of Blackburn enhiel.
The content of the philosophy has become after the tragedy around the school of Jokela theme of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturient who cited the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law that will be dealt with six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is considered criminal, but the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you close a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than when downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a strike than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute, a prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a withdrawal of freedom from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
The trade of copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not occurred by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, yes, so if my colleague is right, then someone has screwed his claims quite high.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from monthly salary are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was created by using tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Bonner Brain Research Center, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers found that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were properly responsible and therefore received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, it also came to a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure if it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such an outcome.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has endeavors with the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Court, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main responsible of the Srebrenica Massaker – at which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on the free foot.
Their names are listed on the list of director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, seeks the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue their projects to secure and print those criminals.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost expense, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance contractor.
This Agreement shall be established in writing by means of an insurance agreement that states that the Company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding deduction sum in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of creating the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
Insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher accident risk, contribution payments will also be higher.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their carefulness.
The same applies to married individuals, as these, according to the statistical values, and therefore, according to the company’s conviction, tend to fewer accidents like alone standing.
The benefits of the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select the auto insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance in order to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds make numerous obstacles in choosing a cheap insurance, such as low driving practice and young driving license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full cash insurance, there are nevertheless more affordable alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full casco with self-participation, so that the services of a full casco insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves that the customer must pay a portion of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europe, an online insurance mediation company.
Another option is the advanced insurance that insures the customer against external accident damages, but not against damages incurred in the car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a counsel.
If you are under 25, it’s in your hand to lower insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff in the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penal payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and their revenues.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract, which is why the fact that the accident rate drops with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most useful to choose a full-cash insurance with self-participation.
Usually young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in case of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practical year after the fear of the beginner has been dismissed.
Nevertheless, a married customer who does not have children is more advisable to complete full cash insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the appropriate person.
On the side of the insurers, couples of marriages with children are considered to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contributions are also low.
In this case, full-cash insurance with self-participation (at a amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an advanced insurance is recommended that it only takes place for the third vehicle year.
They drive more relaxed overall and possess a greater purchasing power that allows them to pay a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners it is offered to complete full cash insurance with self-participation (at an amount of 150 euros), or an advanced insurance that only uses a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, car insurance is something very important not only because it protects the driver against potential accidental injuries, but also because it contains high costs that require a thorough selection that matches our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals before the Champions League pre-round is completed. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while it decides to participate in the Scots.
The Italian team has already had five points and confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a decision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not take the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will be held at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the 13th semi-final for the entry to the final, which will take place on 16th.
This group will be completed in front of all others, and the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be unsolved to the expected outcome, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not speculate at home the Keltic Glasgow knows that they would be in the event of a group first victory and therefore have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team might have a defeat enough to qualify, but he shouldn't rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points of equality, Ukrainians are participating; who had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second match (2-0).
The Milans will therefore try to leave the Scots the evening, and they hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second consecutive time after they were defeated in exactly the same round in the previous season through a gateway of kaka in the post-playing time (1-0) and by a zero too undivorce on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth final and its membership in the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, could win the third place by winning the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start shot in Vancouver in the eyes of 20,000 viewers for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place Vancouver.
About the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the outsold stadium, showing a video on the history of the band, which had taken care of Furore at the end of the nineties.
The reunification and world tours are overwhelmed with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing golden armchains on the stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that brought the GM Palace to shine, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
While the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star didn’t have our wardrobe once to face, and that’s why I’m really looking forward to what he’s going to have about the appearance.
Sporty Spice, whose exit from the group in 1998 due to inner differences of opinion moved after the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw the attitude of the world’s public had changed, the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not actually; so I’m happy to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed the separation of the band that led to her nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes have been eliminated and now everyone liked it again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to report from the television station CTV, the group arrived in a special Virgin Airlines machine in Vancouver.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was received by a child's army.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will be held in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New concerns about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute shifted between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russia’s exports of fuel to West Europe will be impaired.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia’s higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changeing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This consequently led to a case of exports to West Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas makes up a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world’s largest gas stocks, but a lot of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the prejudice registers for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service does not have accurate ideas about the number of foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly by five health authorities in a sample.
The main financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in Old Bailey in October, and was burdened in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out controls in advance of employment of foreign employees to ensure that they possess the qualifications, experiences and authorizations required to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review prior punishment registers, the agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the auditor's report now states that the Board of Directors should apply guidelines for the Criminal Register Execution, which helps employers in controls in various countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they were not carried out routinely," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health agencies would follow their investigation guidelines highly before employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations before employing potential NHS employees would identify people that could commit future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it says that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish healthcare agencies say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have problems identifying those employees who are permitted for indefinitely time.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mainly observed.
These include pass, work permit, and qualification controls.
the Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls prior to the beginning of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was concerned to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on check tests prior to employment of all employees – including those from abroad – whose publication is scheduled next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has hidden five awards at the British Independent Film Festivals, among other things for the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to main actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was given for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and side actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the best actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond performer Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting the British movie to the world.
The prizes were passed at a London Roundhouse ceremony.
Control follows Curtis rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years old.
The black white movie – on its soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, who is most likely to be known for the cultured cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and best director debut.
Rockmusic was the center of another winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British movie.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the prize named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my guy Man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist campaign
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned a coming attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an allied of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a strong fast attack group of 35,000 men to protect plants after a failed Al-Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who immigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, 22 others had planned to kill clerks and security forces.
The government has warned more to do to stop Saudi leaders who strive to join Iraq with al-Qaeda militias, who want to fight the allied armed forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, who are considered by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudi leaders as ketzerous.
Al-Qaeda militias consider many clerks in Saudi Arabia as being in cooperation with the authorities in support of the politics of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabia-born Al Qaeda leader to target the prowest Saudi government - have it in addition to foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
“This was a very great effort by security forces over the past five months,” a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising "Takfiri Thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims that are burned as unbelievers and abducts.
Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
Climate on Venus could make a view of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European spacecraft on an orbit shows that the planet is even more similar to a default twin of the Earth than it had previously been aware of.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planetary railways, but the Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have dominated conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could have even been inhabitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbreaking carbon dioxide treehouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sunlight and a slower rotational pace, Venus introduced a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-powerful winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express Space Sound of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provide an enthusiastic view of how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Physics Department at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth while the planets otherwise are pretty similar."
“Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which the Venus started billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment.”
Police captured "enrich uranium"
According to reports, a kilogram of radioactive material enriched uranium was seized yesterday by the Slovakian and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be asked by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to address a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters record and submit video questions to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected precisely the state of the Republican party that breaks into the elections next year.
It is not known just like CNN’s producers who supported the debate with selecting the YouTube clips to be shown.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest dedicated to a single subject, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unselected voters to use a voting disk when they heard things they liked: the TV facility noticed the leads of approval as the candidates spoke strictly over the boundaries.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake out the reputation he had been severely in terms of illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly vigorous asked if one of the candidates would support an “amnesty” (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, managed to rehearse this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have gone to the immigration package earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share the same views: sharper boundaries, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be seen as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether candidates believe every word in the Bible.
This led to Giuliani to the view that although the Bible was his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now in contrast to all expectations on the first place in a recently conducted survey in Iowa thanks to his long-established Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa, along with Ron Paul’s recent donations and his torments of accusation, fall in Wednesday’s debate.
These two were shot up from nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate had the party from the beginning and was convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twink at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far unclear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall down; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this isn’t particularly confusing.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no Parisian politician paid hotel bills, no extramarital toes were happy.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has hidden more than £650,000 donations to the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have succeeded well without the contested Gordon Brown.
As two months ago the Prime Minister had removed the demand for a election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion surveys would not have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly intelligent chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has evolved to Mr. Bean.
The uncomfortable rescue of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under shooting.
Badly thoughtful proposals to amend tax laws have imposed corporate associations against the government.
The tax official loss of personal data from 25 million people showed unpredictable administrative plushes.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house from protest against cuts of military expenditure: being ministers of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many gifts of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former execution manager) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown will break irrevocably towards the departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule.
Neither politicians nor trust people, but they usually retain their sceptics when a new troop takes the office.
When it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he doesn’t even take a long time in it, this relief is over: the public service begins to become unclear; the Cabinet Ministers begin to talk; the press seeks bad news; and the government becomes defensive and targeted.
In one way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new bear.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax competence documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's mischief - as with the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
Nonetheless, Brown’s location is not as bad as it looks.
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely confused.
And the antiremedium, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s of course always promised stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new joke about political donations is a good example.
The garboesk Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, does not wish public recognition for his will.
Maybe that’s the way, but he didn’t decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who said he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financial operator, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
However, Brown has not been involved yet: there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he drained this determination by grabbing a well-known instrument, an investigation committee to the subject - to fully make the degree, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn out" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition to this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardlines of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party partner like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion surveys; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through incontroversial righteousness and solid competence.
Card hair
Does America’s credit crisis start credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that backflows turn up excited.
Now that America’s real estate market crashes, the predators have the country’s credit card market in the visor.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of infection of underfinanced loans spread to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the sum rates that measure the proportion of loans that are not removable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card users.
It’s too early to fall in panic.
Losses and columns are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third quarter mouth rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which, in turn, constitute a large part of the kedit card losses; the number of applications (and thus saving fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay off each month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stop in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects output amounts for 2007 to be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate loan crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt now that home loans dries out.
However, the card exhibitors look at money flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily exhaust a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be advantageous for the card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage rates drop when real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts are more important among the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more temperate conditions by changing interest rates or borders.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-assessment of assets.
“We won’t wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s main financial reference.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decline are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and a lower credit reduction press America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly stand in front of a griever future.
Keep looking at these sharks.
British Bankers Confess Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers who should be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial director Andrew Fastow changed their requests on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally called for innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was applied to January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Court Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, one unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK over the course of two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a lost end of an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges initially filed against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was the goal of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to crash a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top counselor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron’s partnership controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinery that contributed to the company’s failure.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow mistakenly reported to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others saw about $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow made himself known in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enron Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana’s federal prison.
Copper has a penalty of three years and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot based on a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in waiting for the court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, broke down in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks no longer could hide the billions of debts or make weakening businesses seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than $2 billion pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Board Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron break.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were invalid after he died last year for heart disease.
Not below in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that’s small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a business president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream on Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumption presented to the show, organized in an embedded exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in money in everything, from mahogany-taped yachts to diamond-coated autogrills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously took a shiny orange Porsche at the next trade fair stand.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
“According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas during its brilliance times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in crowds to Europe, where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflighters in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible money editors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold rash.
Otherwise in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, belonging to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion people, who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
Furthermore, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth $670 billion together, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, which was written by economic experts at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert group here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8% of Russians lived under the minimum existence in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelry officer.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time along with the Russian merchant of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well maintained and men are all worth a wealth.”
While traveling through the halls in evening clothing Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and her customers millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and try to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she weared, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the newspapers, the type of brand-conscious Russian purchasers who would be ready to stand in the storage for several hours to visit a supplied storagehouse that flatlessly placed Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom Billiard tables and teards in Dubai.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Gijrath, who patrioticly sat at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a large wall imitation of a Rembrandt picture of hand painted blue mosaic stones.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in clippers.”
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old according to Russian standards) have already moved from big-track logos to the type of sober brand with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trading show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires, or simply tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
Some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Bedten, said he would have sold two 70,000 dollars of mattress set made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the orange Porsche grills for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, L.A. Connection’s president, a company adapting luxury cars to customer requests, said he would have sold three auto cooler grips for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, equal to chain brackets linked to each other, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with speaks he had covered with coloured Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have strawberry leather wheels or a picture of the face of his wife from cubic circonium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Karapetian said.
“He will keep it in his 30 or 40 garage.”
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said, the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, in view of the rise of the home real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more than you believe.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set four red phone cells according to the British model, which were fully stopped with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the money around, mobile photos while sitting back in the middle of replacement wealth, letting friends knit, or just to insert a few million.
"See, everyone can feel like a millionaire in Moscow," Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected surgery suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Harvest Thanksgiving Festival when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stopped two doors below West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
“Then I saw the cart of the doctor’s body spectator come near,” Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
“This was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The listeners learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators try to determine whether she died because of a proceedings carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon whom the police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what Ms. Arroyo’s death caused, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help disclose a mysterious death that sent a grief through the leadership of Newark police.
Since September 2006, Mrs. Arroyo was an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-necked," Mr. McCarthy told Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a step daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
“This is one of the possibilities,” said Ms. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared death on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn’t want to say if Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators attempt to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a desolate rose tree stands in the short front garden and a Dalmatian beats behind the house.
A blue fish labeled "Ethyl vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking space next to a door leading to the bottom floor.
Two mountain bikes hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him manage in the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise in world stock markets
Yesterday, the shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean after market hopes that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthened by calming comments by the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that policy must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down markets, given signs of emerging loan tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences would have "partially reverse some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October."
If increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further exacerbation of financial conditions for consumers and companies, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now as the sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its worldwide workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the U.S. hypothetical credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index jumps by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289,40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany’s Dax index increased by 2.6% and France’s CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Previously, the recovery of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks was awarded to a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and eat more capital to the monetary markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" credit rates were seen to lend between UK banks with 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since November 21.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who should beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important, because at least under this special title, David Graveney is here to appeal to Chief Trainer Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually not filled with applications for national electoral officers, if they are part time.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth racket position will be unfortunate, but life is often unjust and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to fix precisely, which allows a person to achieve the top of his professional branches, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where choosing is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good degrees that know the business well.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or undergo.
Of course, numbers have a huge influence on decisions, but chances have it as well.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain’s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular opportunities on order if he wants to make impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the chooser is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson appeared to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind throws into the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their gloss points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium, it can only be one view question.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, however it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting to strengthen himself, who made the breakthrough into a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored twice a hundred against Australia in Australia, maybe still underestimated.
Probably Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion during today’s network meeting at the Asgiriya stage, will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shah’s greater experience about Bopara’s youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his bright and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years old at 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indias in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player of Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the vibration from his hit that was still obviously in Bombay.
On the contrary, the all-pounder from Essex has a lot of life pleasure.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket field and his attitude was brought to the point away from it when he recently had overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to bring out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook who had watched this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he clings his medium speed with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choosing.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah might not stand well when, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city will return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, in terms of the Shiite militia of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces back at this time.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher of the predominant Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped drive Al-Qaeda from its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with handgranates after he asked his citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called on me and told me that they began one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that the increasing calm in the capital since the US troops rise and the growth of local “groups affected citizens” that armed and in cooperation with the US military defend their districts.
But more talked about being forced home due to visa problems and devastating money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exilants that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are likely to have escaped from the sectarian death swadrons in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni pensioner said.
“I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnites were expelled from Shiitic residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have declined.
There are fears that a sudden stream of refugees will again cause sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saar countries press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“I’ve declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saarland that we are not French,” this slogan is placating the smallest federal country in self-Ireland for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
So the universities are already in tradition close cooperation with neighboring countries.
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high at 15.6%.
However, the country’s children also bring the Saarland to universities in an above-average number – many of them without a graduation at the gymnastics.
“In Saarland you use the vocational education system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an IW educational expert.
More than every fifth young people acquire their graduate permission at a vocational school, thus Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic education is also relatively strongly expanded.
Based on the population, the equipment with dual degree courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates in recent years has declined by one-third.
That is why the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering matters.
“We have started some reforms at the general educational schools after the first Pisa study,” said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government carried out national comparison tests.
In order to begin learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now copies other federal countries as well.
Whether students’ achievements improve sustainablely, future comparison studies will only show.
At Pisa in 2003, the share of risk students declined from 29 to 20 percent.
In general, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal countries.
The Bavaria is expecting better.
And the destruction of the Saarlands is not measured foreign language skills at Pisa - otherwise in this area you could point out.
Because the language of the neighbors is duty for gymnasies - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez puts the watches around
In Venezuela, the watches tick soon differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timemeters in the South American country back for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law says the watches are set on the world time minus four and a half hours.
This means that the South American state gets a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States had imposed the world’s placement in time zones to full hours.
Also, on Wednesday, Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia because of a getaway time.
The left nationalist said, as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will never maintain relationships to the leader of state nor to the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform, about which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to remove the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe has “swept Venezuela in the face” with his decision, Chávez said on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in full mouth.
A new phone ringtone in the country provides for furore: "Why not te callas" (Why you don't think your mouth) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who was generated by the constant intermediate calls of the left populist at the latest Ibero-American summit and had driven him over his mouth.
Germans threaten wage reduction in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are threatening a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“These are the debt of the modest wage development, VAT increase and food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economics Research at the Bild Zeitung.
New burdens could also arise on employees in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the New Osnabrück Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent of the year change was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Labour Agency cannot come back in embarrassment to have to ask the Federal Union for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was known that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices rose by 3.0 percent in comparison with the year.
Venus is the Hollow Twin of the Earth
Venus is more similar to its life-hostil atmosphere on Earth than so far: the European space sound "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind turbines on the Poland, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected it shines on Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has been demonstrating - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on the Venus shoots at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Ursuppe theory, lightning has created life on earth: storms are supposed to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is approximately a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes there are 500 degrees of temperature.
“Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but it is a twin,” Russell said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a mileage for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s no longer had been a special probe to explore this planet.
The latest research results, now presented in several "nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that the common aspects of our neighboring planet with the Earth are larger than initially accepted,” Esa said.
In addition to the previously known vertebral wind on the northern pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel on the southern pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth’s winter hemisphere, a research team writes about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most significant planet in the Solar System has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large as it is with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet also referred to as the morning or evening star rounds around the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venust day takes 243 earthly days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar barely reminds the Earth, scientists assumes both planets have emerged under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water was accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbon stones, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present the outside world in this matter a split nation,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the difference in cultures," Köhler said.
Anyone who knew that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but Merkel took protection from the charges, she conducts a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly revealed disgust over the receipt of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked from rows of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the Union's "swaper policy" in foreign policy.
After the receipt of the Dalai Lamas at the Chancellor’s office, severe irritation occurred in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only deployed the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries according to the SPIEGEL information.
China's Chief of Government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lamas' reception as a mistake.
China refuses if European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other today’s provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against crawls as in France
Road battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns from crawls as in France.
Everything needs to be done in order for social dissatisfaction in Germany to not be discharged in force on the street, the Federal Interior Minister called for.
Barricades burned, randaliers shot with scratches on the police: After the heavy youth walls in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We must make sure that even with us social explosives is not built and discharged in violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he said in the Hannover New Press.
Not every young person deals with the rapid change in social reality.
Countries, countries and municipalities have already worked with an emphasis on reducing problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, the first success is already shown.”
For warning, however, it was too early.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are non-urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered severe street battles to the police in recent nights.
Also in Toulouse burned cars and public buildings.
Greater efforts to integrate the Federal Government, however, called for the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the crawl in France, Kolat warned of "imitational effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bright as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under the age of 25 is "over-average".
It is essentially necessary to provide more educational settings.
Kolat said, “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control in families takes place."
Many young people with migrant backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warned, "But still we have to watch."
It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and education.
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter overflow the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning waste bars and cars.
Since the previous day, an offering of around 1,000 security forces provides peace.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the province.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the consequence, the trouble in Toulouse came over.
The crawls inflamed in a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s first findings, the police are not blaming the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The remote appearance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is finally content--and that nothing can be expected from herself.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her uncoolful appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was poor and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that it should finally be ruled.
The accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel has rejected with a seriously overlying sentence.
This was provincial, she said and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for everyone how much its accusation applies.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloud presented herself: an upscale politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the area.
Example Climate Protection: Since it praises unbreakfully for Heiligendamm’s decisions, it doesn’t say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
Overall, self-loving — so much immodency the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she's clinging to the floskels that the rise comes to people.
This damages her image as a pragmatician who solves problems instead of talking to the world beautifully.
But in the Empire of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a random appearance.
Child poverty and the worries of the low earnings?
They have a few side-sets left for it.
It is important how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supply.
Merkel needs three runs to bring out a half-way straight sentence.
She's stumbled like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a hard strike exchange – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already in the first topic.
He made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney throws Rudy Giuliani to his counterpart.
“I would say that his own house was a port for illegals,” Giuliani said, prosecuting the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-turned 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keyword givers.
"With this type of isolationism, we have made Hitler come to power," John McCain says to his counterpart, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Even Romney is strongly read by Vietnam Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates throats to be tortured.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq War and torture debates, the reactions of the Saal public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium appreciates.
It is once again shown where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” explains Romney and served in front of base and television for refusing him to be among the supporters of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the slope when he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilians for the first time
One day after his resignation as army executive, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn on Thursday for another five years.
Pakistan’s television broadcasted the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he passed his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his power captured in an unblooded military strike, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the emergency state Musharraf imposed on 3 November.
Musharraf will soon after his oath, according to Prosecutor-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the emergency state and thus fulfil a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court of Justice, which Musharraf had occupied with him well-weighted lawmakers in early November after the imposition of the emergency state, had rejected all claims against the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the grass rock return
Germany’s Seventy-Year-old Supergroup re-muzicates: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a Berlin concert.
For the Revival, a medium of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The encompassed sensation then occurs in the form of three seated men at the evening board.
Everyone has his box in front of himself, his cables, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the flower white shirt at the age of 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone contributes to noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This doesn’t seem to be greatly disturbing even the men themselves.
That the band Harmonia re-musics, under herbal lovers, has provided some excitement.
The name, although the collective memory of pop memory was confused, is not so sustainable in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what means misleading herbal rock was always more regarded in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the echo prize for the work of life to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no boundaries.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hocked at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old boyfriend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the revelation in strangers is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio existed only two years and in that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently allocated to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously musicised with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the much promising name Cluster.
First, it was played in the keller under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label entertained by the church.
Rother had helped briefly at the power plant and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
By 1973, Rother followed the cluster musician in exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as urban flying municipalities.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be painful as a child.
It's more likely to be an artist.
In the block waste, it was also supposed to be a name of the Harmonia Ottenstein song association and for the art.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so left and humble music sounded, the band suffered material need.
The rice collection did not serve only for self-finding.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut off at a concert in Griessem, before a nearly 50-head records, as someone thinks.
From Rother then came the desire to force Harmonia and occasionally practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an inconsistent demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoteric-Spheric and secured his existence with albums like "flaming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia.
The live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland disc company has set its objective to maintain the herbal rock as its own German contribution to the living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
What the entire bandwidth of the influences of the herbal rock would be surrounded by the following pop music.
Harmonia will fill out the emptiness of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence flows with the most special sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
Legend formation serves projections of other black white photos of wire-wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again dealt with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and the drummer to unlock the instruments via self-based effect devices unheard tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical depths.
The choir of the house doesn’t change it either.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstars is hosted under sound clouds and singed in a beautiful place with an emphasis "Aaaaaaaaaaaa!".
Graudrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music high schools (Can), technologies (powerwork) or on escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls "68" here doesn't have completely wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to get it out of quiet even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give you great happiness to fleeing moments.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough
“The Hunting Party” and “Murderal Peace” are once again focusing on the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and donors or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can’t help in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: While the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but except there, in the dark backland of the Bosnia-War, actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighteen’s last in our eyes because too many nice-related roles in women’s well-being movies and too many press conferences on Buddhism expelled the pleasure of looking at.
Now, Richard Gere suddenly is the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter becomes hunted" (why movie title really needs to be as long as local guide agreements?).
In principle, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from gere if fate and the film industry weren’t so gracious: a man who has long behind his best times, but who even has preserved as a ruinous memorial of his decline, even considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" along with German production "Killer Peace", which also launches this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from Kosovo’s hip snipers, and then one is still in love with them quickly.
Although it is worth welcoming that even the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the flat-screen movie loses all too quickly in giballer and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without the highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, “The Hunting Party” can be exemplarily explored why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three US war reporters opening up to track the Serbian Upper War criminal "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in the Personal Union Richard Shepard) at a different time.
Because the stories resemble fascinating: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can’t do and both times it’s going to be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that we don’t just let Simon Hunt be the downward cynician with heart when he was introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to deal with him, above all, with a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" then goes down, when reporters succeeded in the last five minutes in the time rate procedure what NATO, CIA and all the world’s head hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving the Muslim Bosnians to fair vengeance.
This is so bad that we would like to appeal to the International Court of Justice in Den Haag for crimes against cinematics.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to accuse Karadzic and Mladic to still run freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should be exceptionally agree once) not to carry out the persecution too intensely because of secret political agreements.
But the good common and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I see the swollen front veins with compassion, meaning: how hard it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swell heads, but that suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War film.
The newspaper recently reported that all Iraq films were large Hollywood flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: When a star drives around the crisis hordes or mine fields of the world, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond all borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamants” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood was able to shoot a good film about the Holocaust.
Some movie will probably be mature - the Vietnam works now applicable as a classic "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass killing comes home in real time on two screens, even simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this robs the scriptwriters the unconvictedness it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or Nothing" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the Sarcast-distanced artist view of romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan War, he answered: "This is only because some things never change.
Major cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always rule in Yugoslavia.”
Beust's criticism for Olympic Resignation
The Mayor’s resignation from Hamburg’s application for Olympic Summer Games has faced heavy criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism in the assessment of the opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, called a resignation “not good for the economic location.”
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic Idea.
"Without this goal, the sports political impulse would not be maintained in the same degree."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed time range".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in previous statements that the Hamburg Olympic ambitions were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Federation’s decision for early December on Munich’s application for the Winter Games 2018.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we’ve previously thought of until 2028.”
Nonetheless, the dream is not dreamed forever, Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportsbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will make the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to set up a chance by buriing the plans at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction with the statement of the Senate Chief on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg’s application for the Universiade 2015 “not as a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizenship group claimed to the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed on the Olympic map and lock out the housing building," SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Little Grassbrook has always requested an integrated planning for Olympics and a later residential use, the CDU has placed one-sided on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games in Hamburg at the time caused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and wood box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Currently, in Sweden, wood boxes are thrown dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there of the "Type Stockholm" are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to an enthusiastic outcome: The six "Brillo-Boxes" of the international market, which former museum director Pontus Hultén has given as a gifts in 1995.
The history is disguised, a confusing conquering of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wood boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: these did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not artworks, but their models, just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now talk about fifteen boxes, which at the time were authorized as the original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" rightly entered into the history of art and auction.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later wrongly claimed that in 1968 some hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, the Warhol then left him.
Indeed, Hultén’s 105 boxes were produced in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the Swedish private ownership boxes in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were only founded and removed, then white oil color was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press range board with a painter roll without basics - it is also not oil, but acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will be the six boxes in his collection.
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced to follow the "heavy accusations" raised in the case of the soap powder boxes.
Since then, there is an indignant silence.
Rebelly soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers dropped up in a Manila hotel and called for President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s fall.
He couldn’t respond to blood shedding, leader Antonio Trillanes, who predicted corruption and election fraud, said reporters at the hotel.
Government soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The two dozen soldiers have been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly discontinue with about 30 sympathetics.
The military police who were to actually guard him were apparently overwhelmed to him and joined his murder.
They entered the peninsula hotel and called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the front hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National safety advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanding the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics have called for major demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Its government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila’s financial district was already in 2003 the main venue of the attempted muteries of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours in refusing the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to attack democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a large shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is €14.46, as the company reported on Wednesday night.
It is now held 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
An acquisition was speculated before.
We keep the option open to further increase the share of versatels.
With the step we want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United said.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares only a third party, said the financial market.
On the early day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drilllich with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million.
United bought 5.15 million shares of it for 31.4 million euros.
Furthermore, the companies have started talks about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We're strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
Previously, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of about 10 percent of Freenet and do not make use of their right to take on another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all the options open, in particular to further increase the participation in Freenet AG, said.
Talks between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
Freenet’s poker for months and hard to see is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held directly 6.01 percent of Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillish will bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent by the investment company Vatas has been agreed in August.
