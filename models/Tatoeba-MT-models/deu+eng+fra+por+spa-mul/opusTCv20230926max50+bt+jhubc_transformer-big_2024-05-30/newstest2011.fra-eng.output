CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elects in the capital town hall will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understanding at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the arc that was born in the town hall over the last few years, when they were the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The vocabulary encoded that the Prague political cream has launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new elects do not understand the known terms too well.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
“I’m a fast in Prague’s politics,” Lukas Kaucky, who was elected to culture at the test of the “Parrain’s vocabulary.”
And with regard to the political veteran, the elect Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "good golf."
“This is the only expression among those you suggest me to use.”
Otherwise, I don't use the arc.
From the vocabulary, whose newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June this year before the pre-electoral ODS, the writing chose six examples, primarily those associated with the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", going to the patisserie, "beef nerve", "traition of the capital" and "deployment".
Three of the elected have agreed on the quiz, the quarter- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not get the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has squarely refused the test.
“I don’t care about these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion.”
"I'm currently taking care of how we're going to understand ourselves as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucky and immediately adds, “but I know about the newspapers.”
"I'll have to pay a language course," he's funny.
Not only is the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental elected, know that the golf hole is Blanko’s tunnel.
The two social democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks the meaning of "going to the pastry."
"I think it's about going to a business," Plachy is ready to guess it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
On the same tone Brezina reminds him that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to testing candidates, there is no lexicon in social democracy.
“I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don’t have something like that.”
“Rather, names are sometimes used by abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina admits about surnames.
The newspaper Actual.cz has tested the name and it works.
Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by frauds during the sponsorship of the Party, is called "the little play".
The surnames are also the only ones that Social Democrats admit to employ within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn’t like to hear Hulda much, but the newspaper Akutel.cz recorded another surname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Law of Matrack" he appears to recall that Petr Hulinsky earned his title as a doctor in Law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to decrease tortures in the "societies," a brochure published.
In Burkina Faso, declared witches have common characteristics.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sorcier" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man has that destiny very rarely.”
“Young healthy women are not judged because they participate in work and are born children,” says a sister in the capital of this Western African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit witch hunt.
The case contains a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, neighbor to Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they had sprinkled her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onions was inflamed in contact with the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "chase the evil spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of the "sortiers" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human-eating people have always represented a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunt, Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself participating in it.
“After his aunt’s death, Gambia’s President Dzammi launched a wide hunt for witches who, he seems, would have participated in his death and had been striven by black magic to kill the President as well.”
“Near-rescue Guinea shamans have brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and personal guard of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages of Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, people in prison had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
About a thousand people have been released on international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The poils warm, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out by the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "Coal Baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He wore under his arm a record with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter's and his son's, who was purging a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," the man who has the power of signature shows his son's new contract.
"But I signed yet," he explains to a motion angry and half-resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent," advises tenant to not sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by fronding the eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic are expected whose rent does not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 o'clock in the morning.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "Loyer 2011", is on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already starts to illuminate on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple comes to find out about the rent, but the new rent seems not to affect people in the waiting room.
Most people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from over 44,000 apartments from the RPG portfolio collect letters with new lease contracts in their letter box since about mid-November.
Byty RPG offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special shop for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
"He works for almost a week, so it's still at trial," he replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the shelf when the customer appears as a journalist.
The deragulation and ancient miners apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and Ostrava region of the Social Democrats Lubomir Zaoralek has reported it quite sustainedly before the elections, and this now fills local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a board in the toilet, relieves in introduction the mentioned man.
However, they are mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a return of half the amount of the rent that the other tenant will receive who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the Havirovaska street "deregulation" shelter is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," the employee said.
And yet RPG possess both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rent when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
“It’s not threats, but only to inform you about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally,” RPG says on its website.
"Nobody will go to court here," one of the Byty RPG employees thinks, and the man on the street in front of the customer center gives him right.
"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have left 5,000 crowns to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and therefore people are waiting," she says.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to Byty RPG, are an economic need.
“And moreover, current rentals still don’t reach the level needed for simple housing maintenance,” says Pavel Klimes, director of the RPG’s residential portfolio, that it’s just the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging to the ceiling in front of the chairs filled in the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and is not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at least 7,50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, it is an increase in a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns at m2,” RPG adds.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
Byty’s RPG promises that deregulation will not cause a radical, but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all money from the increase in rent (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursing school is also part of offices that included architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini nursing school with everything needed - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The project-architectural company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini business nursing school since the first buildings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs approximately 90 people, especially the age of making children, and she mattered that women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as low-time work contracts, nursing school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects have the opportunity to allocate work carefully for children.
The employees of Arch.Design themselves imagined this maternal school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursing school is funded through the means of the European Social Fund through the Czech Republic's Human Resources Operational Programme and State Budget.
Thanks to funding allocations (2.8 million.de Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and devices and after two years to ensure qualified staff and launch.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini maternity school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the Economy rating company has helped making the request for grant.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a nurse teacher all day care for children. Children can go to nursing school without limitation of age, but they are over three years for most.
As it is a "mini maternal school", there can only be five children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who are replacing themselves.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without a look at the hierarchical position.
Although it acts on individual care and education, the mini nursing school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not only play it, but quality teaching is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation of school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with toys and imaginative games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have a delay stress to go to a school away from parents' workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural loyalty relationship is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus enrolled among companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house fascinates yet after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The toast resembles the back of a prehistoric Saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batllo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the surname of House in bones.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, tile fragments and mosaic, reminding stairs and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for Antoni Gaudi’s New Art.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dreamlines, its pleasant colours and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, pace and order thought accurately.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colours is reinforced.
The winding and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies waveframes of windows, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, oilton and lamelles.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample neighborhood in the Passeig de Gracia market street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was made for two years and the house ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another entirely new but quickly accepted Gaudi’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housing house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely about his project that the decorations were born for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade, other artists and creators also worked.
The common work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals called the hot house just after it finished because of its organic shapes "the house in bones".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism for opening the windows, called it "the house that dashes".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St. George's boss of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with aerial windows and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems weird.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the construction guidelines of then and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city's construction permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the municipal council was horrified and requested changes.
For example, it did not like members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction start on the public roadwalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented in a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is shared by a staircase by which you access to an independent toast terrace.
All straight angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received additionally new facades a non-traditional grill and two additional floors.
The Gaudi game with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was just enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to cross this step in 2002 on the 150th anniversary of the famous creator’s birth.
They continued the visits because they found that it is a profitable company and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and the attic, including toilet terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is not really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist cards holders have 20% discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you need quickly to find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a summary: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and summary give a real base for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement themselves harmoniously to please a specific user.
During choosing several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and summary are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattress are not continuously sleeping, they are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a weight higher than standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mold can also be formed there.
The habit is also decisive in choosing.
Anyone who spends the clearness of time abroad where you frequently use very thick mattress with a rambling layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattress with a rambling layer of parish foam."
“Such mattress are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore poorly assume “the information” of the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczykova, who specializes in woven furniture.
That’s why a few years ago the mattress with a foam-smooth conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex and also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattress.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a breathtaking foam.
This miracle simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses on you and you won’t go back in the night like after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
The shaving foam also works as a protection against the squares.
For choosing the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm so need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seat bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For beds in one place, singles, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
This is convenient in the event of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you're lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, Chairman of the Bourreliers-matraces and decorators Association who has been dedicated for several years to the problems of healthy sleep and the economy of the mobile.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own summary and mattress, so care however during the craving to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only remain to mount the summary to different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattress at least 15 cm, of which count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"When you touch or sit on the mattress you do not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of summary.
The summer bed, when the mattress and the summer are united like Siamois sisters, has nothing to do in bedrooms.
The mattress were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done in the hour'today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and buckled) sieve.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But everything to her but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, for hygiene or laundry, but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And although today it is common to manufacture sliding coatings for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when a fight between a lightweight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a summer?
Never!
At the maximum for a bed for visitors for a single night.
However, equip the board (if there are no) air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-positioned lamel mattress with 14/18 lamels, latex mattress or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more rigidness than possible lamels, 28 and above, where the lamels are doubled in the portion of the kid
For multi-position mattress, it is not necessary to take spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the lamelles, what is called a shoulder cradle can also be installed.
It is a special bond of the lamelles that allows to pressure or even incline the lamelle so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have “the shoulders as wide as the back,” this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "males" have started using a rammolling area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wings or platelet summaries with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads into more points and diminishes the voltage.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and air-swollen) on good mattress and summary, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer by exemplary.
When sleeping on the side, the pillow must upgrade the shoulder height (with the shoulder clutch of the summit or the area moulded in the mattress).
Modern mattress still have something common with the first straw and herb-based.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also on organic mattress.
The petrol-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soybean.
“The Bio qualification for mattress means that the heart is manufactured based on natural products,” explains Petr Vasisek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract from ball plants so that the mattress coating absorbs the heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heats" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for weak sex.
Today’s favorites?
Matraces made of cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure disturbed therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattress that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health tools.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for mattress and summary is not simple.
From time to time, special shares from manufacturers or producers can be made with two mattress for the price of a single.
As for example, Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam sealed with coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, we can take the second for free.
The era of parseous or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness has been started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as a material for NASA because astronauts were suffering from the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur is heated and hardened, on the contrary, cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the hot human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against evil sleep and for an increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattress but also for health products, such as special feet pillows that relieve legs and the veinous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC foam or Twinsaver or of the same type.
Devices to follow people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child brings more and more people to think of watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of lighters but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the little Anicka has excited a large number of people and they started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even though the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that it’s not spying, but just another way to reduce the probability that there’s another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the Czech markets’ tracking devices suppliers.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I haven't encountered such cases yet."
“Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency case.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention that if the child doesn't want to carry something like this, he'll get rid of it.
“And even the smaller can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something expressly when they don’t want to be under control.”
"Mobile phones, which can cut up like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," Bockova said.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything so that the child doesn't have an electronic device that can locate it."
"This is the phone now."
"As the tracking devices will grow, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," the psychologist said.
It confesses, however, that such devices can help in an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having such a device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an aggression.
"The device can be parametered in such a way that it is in regular emission after a given period."
“In the event that the device is destroyed, there is still the last position of the data subject.”
“The more expensive devices also have an inclination meter that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a lengthy position without moving,” said Cech.
According to him, the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prolog.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those that are wearing as a pendant of the size of a box of ignitions or to the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
“This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device.”
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonational cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Department of Defense bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general major state gave as a reason for the assault of an enormous amount of detonation ropes to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it shows that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an exercise of explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Pisek, commander of the army make no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even though it was true, the army reserves could maintain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals is enough for more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has guaranteed - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Quick Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they almost have no ammunition for their hand weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to money needs.
About the lack of body laundry, we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy from us such a large amount of detonating ropes."
And that's their decision and they really know what they do."
“For us the army is a good customer we strive as traders to content,” said STV Group’s business director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues the struggle of hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reported only four years of life of the detonational ropes and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can even go up to four years," said one who doesn't want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
The past lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integral and does not threaten the soldier's life.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other department’s argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of cordial detonants.
“They cost us 60 percent less than the last year’s supply of 245 km,” spokesman Pejsek said in a statement.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating ropes of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexibly the more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes.
The Department of Defense today has serious problems with the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Covenant time when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move on the Rhine.
What awaits this Czech army in a few years that MF DNES contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that it buys today “cheap”.
So far, I’m taking advantage of the contacts that I have obtained thanks to the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur’s contest last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between the quality and price of a accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment reconstructed to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he turned into pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his action as an entrepreneur has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he came to another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates have demonstrated,” last year’s number 1 entrepreneurs said.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the year's entrepreneur's competition has well served," Pytloun adds with recognition.
The victory brought him more popularity and being known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me, and I must say that it was very pleasant,” he said.
He recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in a different way until today.
“Along with those I met thanks to the competition, I began maintaining business relationships regularly.
According to him, success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
“I observe loyalty and pride in their homes to have committed to something that has been recognized in general.”
“This is not, and from a distance, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun with modestness.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the purpose of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind it.
The one who came to pick up the award in Slovansky dum for the first place of the Firm of the Year competition organized last year by Vodaphone is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a toolworkshop at Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crown revenue firm.
“I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees as well and has increased our self-confidence in fighting competition,” says the winner of the last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as a compensation after the communists' confiscation of goods, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few companions in the surrounding of his father for the manufacture of plastic bathrobes.
Not long after they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
After eighteen years, he became the largest manufacturer of auto presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the contest through the media.
“Not only have our customers begun to really know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the largest success in their country of origin,” said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company was made from the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, societies were forced to stop their investment projects and to start limiting their shares of new materials and technologies.
"Of course, we haven't escaped this situation."
“Revenues have fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even license,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained benefits even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
“We built a training and research center with the appropriations, strengthened the company’s presentation at international exhibitions and earned the main awards at national exhibitions,” Zdarsky said.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affiliates rise back and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the official can get it with two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfil in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the year.
This survey is still for the fourth time this year a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
While last year 3,000 voters have manifested, at least 4,000 this year have brought their voices.
And it’s not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only break the company, and, more and more.
“We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax declarations at the world’s top places,” said Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneur's activity becomes a declared goal for all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 more places compared to last year.
The year's Absurdity competition was first set up in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to the end of September, last delay before the closing of the contest.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chose seven candidates for "anti-price" and let the public vote during the month of October on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of voices is declared winner.
Until last year's last survey, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees, for example, is the obligation that maintenance vehicles of highways and fastways pay taxes, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repairing two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the contest website.
The announcement of the contest, which always begins in early November on Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening that regularly participates in political and public personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises in the Czech Republic, or President of the Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic, Petr Kuzel, attended the culmination of the contest.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts cracks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to remove at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword strike in the water.
In 2007, what people didn’t like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual company to where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pelerinage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most fulfilled obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Bureau a service journey for a foreign employee over 30 days, was removed with the Act on the so-called green card.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by the Department of Health order last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny contest, which has already existed for five years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Firm.
The injective of this competition is the support of the company reasonable and fair.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and conduct socially responsible activity,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone company, who is the guarantee and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year’s rebel competition.
For this first year of this 2010 company contest subcategory, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be published.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their supporting and forecasting activity can be regarded as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns persons with disabilities and their employees' personal or health issues.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is not an example of the Prague prologistics company Et Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of Pardubice Regional company is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the leading contributor to the fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The Old Podebrad paper manufacturing factory, which employs more than 70 percent, has been the title of the Central Bohemian Regional Responsible firm and has placed the third place in the region in the competition of the Year's Firm organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for introducing soap working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours a week on average and, without proportionally, wage decreased.
The jury also gives her the title because she prioritizes Czech manufacturers, supports dictated activity in the nearby surroundings and concerns the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, CEO.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a locally protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community,” says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the company.
At the latest rank, also for its activities, a Washing and Cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of a bonus above standards.
“In our company we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure,” said Joseph Strapac of the bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year's Firm competition were automatically registered in the Responsible company category, who had answered the document's attached questionnaire for the registration and sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the lice firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" contest of the Vodaphone Year's Firm."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," said Karel Goldman of the organizational agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public contest
In the building of the Lands Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed their handleboxes to the local entrepreneur and trader in real estate Lubos.
It had tried to just manipulate a public tender for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed ground is obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police pursue a person for initiated offence as part of a tender and a public competition," the head of the prosecutor of Plzen Antonie Zelena told Pravo, knowing it is prohibited to provide more explanations as the investigation is underway.
After 24 hours, police have released this 46-year-old entrepreneur.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of such little official information.
On a question of Pravo, the spokesman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said police officers had actually arrested in Plzen at a separate workplace and during the public competition.
“He acted on a customer and under no circumstances on an employee,” she said.
The public contest according to Cerna has as a real name "Call to propose rights for land transfer according to the Earth Act" and is established when several law-received candidates are demonstrated.
“These individuals propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
"According to the rights proposed for a ranking of purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the ground to the person who offered the highest rights," the Fund spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered with the appeal and as he is himself, also a person benefited because having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably came with withdrawal.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Fonds of Lands).
It was included in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in the criminal case for editing lands for which the decision to establish a construction had already been edited.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, lands for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where the accessible artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole had to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could put the construction at risk by blocking the grounds.
The households will pay a supplement of a hundred monthly crowns for housing.
From January, households will need to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rent will also increase.
As of January, families will have to pull out their wallet up to a hundred more crowns monthly than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many locations central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be nearly 100 crowns annually than today for households in apartment.
However, all suppliers have decreased the prices of electricity given the sensitive development to encourage the manufacturing of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
Therefore, one hundred more crowns can also be counted.
Although electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest communes that plan the increase in prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating nearly 50 more crowns per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For Prague’s inhabitants, a 9% increase in water and sanitation is prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent does not change the pragues will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will be one of the lowest compared to the entire country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already one of the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
The prices of rentals will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the Byty CPI company that owns in Usti nad Labem nearly 2,500 apartments, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be transferred to the courts by the company.
Regulated rent that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children drown with rum and remoteness. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts gently.
Distance, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best whisky brand are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who drown, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recurrence do not make the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who experience cases similar to the admissions of children's hospital departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable, because it takes time to be soft.”
“The trend is really for strong alcohols,” says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief Children’s Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in chipping a bottle of dad into the cabinet, it's sometimes wisky but it's the distancet and the vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for Motol Hospital, also gives him right.
"In general, it's rum or distance."
"It's fashionable alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he became a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to Head of Department of Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked just ten years in pediatrics where the ambulances brought schoolgirls from the large surroundings completely drunk.
“A girl was hospitalized four times.
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in blood with a mixture with extasy," the doctor said.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What is interesting is that the mother didn't seem weird that his daughter is absent for 48 hours," the Department Director said.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their out-of-common tolerance in the face of the fact that their rejections take into the drink that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we do not talk about the addiction, in its strict sense, to children.
"Under the alcoholic vocal we hear chronic alcohol addiction for several years with all the phenomena that arise from it but that we do not find in children."
“At those who use repeating acool, it’s rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background,” Pelikan said.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases are integrated into statistics with a poisoning strike that requires hospitalization.
Drink children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exites, according to Pelikan, three seasonal waves with which we can count: the Witch Day, the Holy Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Whether they drink in spite after bad results or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I lived on the Witch Day an admission of 7 drunk children on a single shot," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in disintoxication under medical control is paradoxally in better position than the child who returned home and suffers the day after the "wood gull".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They are better for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them.”
"They're just surprised about where they're," Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it destroys the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can range up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Of time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drunkenness costs and they could spend the entire summer in seasonal work to refund a single evening," Pelikan said.
However, he believes that health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents the care-related charges, do not deal with drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Department of Defense has exchanged transport planes Casa C-295M, departed on Tuesday to Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the biplace versions of the L-159T1 that so far were in use in the Czech army and were in the flight state.
The three remaining devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationing at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol company - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek from the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is for the moment unknown.
“The L-159 monoplaces planned for the exchange have been taken on aircraft stored for a long time without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.”
"L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He played that the army will not remain unplaced as the department signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces unused into two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first device in July, the second being planned for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and they will serve to train NATO member countries pilots."
"It is therefore the affair of the one who takes into account the determination of how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was agreed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch a tender and directly contacted EADS.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Department of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a European-wide bidding appeal and in no circumstances by direct contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men aged 60," co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University, said.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be subjected to prostate cancer test, especially by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same likelihood of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men aged 60, the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of both cited fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, renowned Czech genetician and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and roads, there is most of the time of compact snow, the deblayer worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93th kilometer towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The Auto Club Central Dispatcher (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st mile a truck was accidented, at the 93st two heavy-duty trucks hit themselves, the accident caused wounded.
Several cars were also found in the gap.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th mile towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go by Brno and then enter the 182th kilometre to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several miles has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, so, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car lines are created in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also buckled.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams take delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's crisis headquarters must still meet.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast connections.
Routes for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed from Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are already rollable but redoubled with vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three lateral roads are impracticable, on the road to Brno it begins to be snowflakes by places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication paths in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowmakers and strawberries.
It is not possible to estimate when they are rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is rigorous in the White Carpath region.
On the roads that, in view of the protection of nature, are maintained only by the spray of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czech, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow disappeared in Czech Republic gradually.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. military sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic gun will have an influence on the conflict with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this gun and containing a highly ruptured explosive, actually works like small granates.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
Therefore, it can be used against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall, or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel flashes, it can put it out of fight as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry gun that uses “intelligent” technology.
“The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and pushes on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
“When you press the relaxation, the weapon charges and pulls at the distance of 543 metres more or less 1, 2, 3 metres,” said Audette.
400 displaced jobs
Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at Mareinbader Square’s office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As said Wednesday, the giant specialised in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term, the group should assemble another 100 jobs still spread up to date in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the employee working mode.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director-General Bernd Wagner said, “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure.”
He claims that connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of a major company inside the region has caused the joy of the winners and caused disappointment of the losers.
Economic Affairs Officer of the Frankfurt Municipality, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a “planetary actor” had been conquered in this way.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its deployment is an important boost for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality very early of this intention.
"It's going without saying that we've offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer faced with the owner of the building at the Marienbader Square.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about avoiding such an exceptional place to remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and dealer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Plaza de l’Hôtel de Ville, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the neighboring “small vertical”, as well as the rest of the buildings of Plaza Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal resort.
From a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the City Hotel, which raised many criticisms, not only because of the impressive arrangement of the surfaces that once served in part parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German Francfort Immobilien-Chancen Group purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. One year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group with its headquarters in Tokyo is considered the world’s third largest IT product supplier.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have taken rent in Astro Park building.
This old twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronics and Electrotechnics Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasingly difficulties.
The Internet Service Provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the website specialized in revealing confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures undergoing after hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes are published.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stays in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with ever more strength.
The cyber activist group "Wikileaks" has no longer access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the leading American senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched for by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," cyber activists said on Wednesday (local time) at the source of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem on Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN’s television channel, quoting Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees.
The president of the Senate Commission on Territory Protection had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, The Guardian.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step earlier in view of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, and thus puts our national security at risk and life at risk everywhere around the world,” the senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the content of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by London's newspaper "The Independant," the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has constantly referred to as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors for the prosecution committed against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were spoken against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is particularly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, Chief of Government Stephen Harper told television, obviously ironicly, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy started between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman of U.S. President Barack Obama, called "ridicule and absurd" the fact that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual owner of a website,” said Gibbs.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Fight, was appointed responsible for fighting leaks.
Travers is responsible for implementing "necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after Wikileaks' disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which the entire administration exchange and protects information.
Furthermore, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were never threatened by Wikileaks’ revelations.
“We’ve done everything to get into contact with them,” state department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if it is necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, Ice Confishers are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German, the somewhat demodised ice confisher, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then begins to sell it.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbets founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines everywhere respond to high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extending for several days. Practical sessions are held in the private ice cream.
In the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of achieving their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a fellow of the Slow Food movement and wants to propose in the future a high-quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management adviser and, after a few years, wants to pull a few things out of this experiencing trade for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil came would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because her children love Italian ice creams.
Glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
It is determining not only good flavor, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and generally southern: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats all to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cooles to four degrees.
It then opens a rod installed on the machine: it comes out a white pastorized base cream, foundation of all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately attacked as a question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact that the spirit of time lets himself mistaken.
The one who speaks only of ice “made from natural ingredients,” perhaps despite this has used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example the guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will crack nothing other than ice granules.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the flavors.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit radius or confessions of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to refill you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"Although, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when adding cocoa powder to it, the base of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice is also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pure: from a taste point of view, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists of largely hazelnut.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture properly brings up the taste of an ice,” says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation exercise: if fishing puree is used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape mosquito).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacturing of ice no longer requires, as once, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the basic mass automatic manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture available is simultaneously beaten to make it onctuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, light failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo bursts fruit puree from the head to the feet and thus excavates his comrades of study when controlling the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Mr. Luciano believes that "such a risk of incidents will occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has novelized the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we were well informed," Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information reports that the chairman of the Efsa group of experts for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has decisively collaborated in the development of Efsa's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticism of Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up textually, per subsection, correspond to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thereby bear the industry mark which would be controlled by the authorities located in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA manager recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period.
Some time ago, even Central Germany Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relationships between the control authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions of both the German Federal Environmental Agency and European Members.
However, Efsa does not acknowledge the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization considers itself a neutral forum that groups experts, among other things, in the field of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize cause to the field,” says then.
The current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not achieve reliable results.
"If we do not look for the risks, how can we discover them?" then he asks about a accusing tone.
This is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the polytechnical school in Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are still barely researchers who are not related to societies.
According to companies, critical studies would not be published.
Mrs. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell was awarded, a total of approximately 400 pounds.
On Monday afternoon, she stood in front of Stuttgart Station with her tube on the back.
There was manifold.
He was snow.
The story is known: In September, the excavators came and had begun to demolish much of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: several thousands of people demonstrated against project S21, transforming Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction works.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender, crude pavé poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm “a modest and cheap, simple and earthly rock.”
He claimed that by cutting her off the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn’t know what he will do with this fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Stuttgart's stone traces lead to a former ammunition deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built its stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken down or disappear in the discharge," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard office.
He tells he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for entire days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything to oppose demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the stone parallelepipedes weighing on average 80 pounds with a value ranging from 6.50 to 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in while hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still embedded in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Particulars.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the box and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limited to herbal bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It's summered this political component."
He enters his car all-terrain, walks around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that he abandoned, and later began to study biology before later interested in computing and eventually became a carrier.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40000 tons.
He gathers treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's getting cold.
Sand stones sculpted with art are placed on the snow.
"Otherwise, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he affirms with enthusiasm.
"My favourite stone."
He takes the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sand stone, previously part of Karlsruhe Station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the St. Blasian Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought the stones were once sculpted by hand and displaced using single claws and carrettes drawn by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into piece."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this carrier today employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” said the waste recycler.
Next, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Fighting talents to conquer high potentials
The counter has a vibrant affluence.
16 students buy salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
Braunschweig Technical University and Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of contest of ideas, they must talk about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body-to-body in the competition to discover better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the best graduates as much as possible in the amphitheater before they arrive on the job market and they are brought by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we are trying to identify the exceptional talents within the framework of practical projects and trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Brauschweig Technical University, the automotive group amated the talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the pens, sweets and cards containing the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group’s enclosure.
It is Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both sides: "Students come in touch with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know students, look closer at serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's once again is the offensive with which we're looking to attract students.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather placed on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In goods in sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sortering a cyrial of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all courtize the highly qualified workforce.
These are especially the graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the vacuum for engineer positions will expand again.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, the audit firm, accounting and advisory expertise.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talents, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can accessibly visit KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
Whoever has to participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
“We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race.”
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have stayed in touch with all people who took part last year in similar action."
“Some of them are about to complete their studies and soon wish to send their requests to our company,” he said.
Besides the direct amazing carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises perform quite conventionally by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in the professional fairs."
“For example, at the Solar Technology Fair,” says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe has awareness of the issues related to rehabilitation.
Currently, 35 positions are placed in the competition on the company’s website.
"It's very difficult to have vacant jobs at this time."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his study end project at us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to advertise by highlighting other qualities: custom atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," said Stübe, staff chief.
For a long time money has no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotional opportunities are the other decisive factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honorary table of German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with respect to their work and context while looking at the employee’s framework conditions.
Staff Head Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company with employees.
“I think candidates are mostly reliant on external assessments regarding a potential employer,” she said.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Krieger, this means primarily taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees,” he said.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within his own workforce.
"Employees satisfied form the best messengers."
When treating employees well and identifying themselves with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama breaks new oil drills
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, southeastern state of the United States, over the coming years.
The Government of Washington has prohibited an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drillings remain forbidden.
Interior secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
This is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident that costs 11 employees to live and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under the pressure of the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States from foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the devastating black tide in golf is not, until today, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion compensation requests, is at the center of accusations.
An investigative committee created by Obama must present its current December conclusions.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the freezing of the drilling decreed after the platform's explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately filed applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and more severe security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, who discredited himself after many accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing deep reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced they would suppress profitable tax niches from gas and oil groups.
Participants in this sector now publicly warn that the power flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The Government's goal is to break the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the pronounced drilling ban on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: “No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new support projects have been deferred to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown, and it produces a smell similar to that that exists in the petrol station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and oil refinement.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist launches to journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud today in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a young man dropped in the boiled water to the chest, as well as the fatty slide that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the brightness of water at the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be realized that the basement is full of brown oil cloths.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells her that she once collected crabs by entire seals here.
But in the meantime the calm waters were completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang out of an oil pipeline that exploded into the huge tide.
Fishermen in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to branch for six hours to reach fishing waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire range of ravages jumps in the eyes when you cross the mangrove marrows crossed by water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the engine boat splits a craying brown water, and anyone dips his hand in it removes her all covered with oil.
The roots of little mangrove emerge from the ground as slice sticks. Isolated palm trees sadly leave their palms hanging.
The clouds of birds are searched in vain, as usually encountered in wetlands: When the outboard engine stops, a fantastic silence falls down on this old paradise that resembles a service station by the smell it produces.
"What happens here is war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni lived is a battlefield settled for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt his production activities in this region because they were very dangerous.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million barrel of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times large as Switzerland, the Ogoni country's oil fields are unexploited, the situation is unexploitable.
All a few hundred meters stand in the water of steel drawers like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are roasted by corrosion until the reference.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature is broken from time to time as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to the expert estimates, more than two billion liters were spread over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that occurred in the sea during the accident of the superpetrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in humanity history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and siphonage of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists in their part consider explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner rejected the Shell group to apply essentially less strict safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the drive failure rate is "ever much higher than allures".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cambogia and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with cambogia to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many tones that sometimes are connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without pattern on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
Raw oil is heated in the tone for several hours, team chief Michael explains.
At first, the gasoline penetrates into a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of the kerosene drops falls and ultimately obtains diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-liter Diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Inhabitants of the Delta are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than that ridiculously low of just 40 centimeters of Euro per liter of Diesel: Because they purchase their raw material for free.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines throughout the Ogoni country, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, completely insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and senior military members, charge the share of the lion in tank ships and bradent in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether environmental disaster should be attributed or rather subversive activities to the population or to the Laxist production mode is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders, and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no stealth and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni relationships especially to Shell were so worse that it was no more than the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to leave,” the robust oil worker announces.
“The soldiers can appear at any time.”
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of arrest, but at the most they will offer them winters.
Even soldiers especially from the north of the country want to enjoy the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"At any point of view, this fucked thing has dropped our country well down," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 is obviously suffering from a major security problem.
By examining a device that carried out an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction failure that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had visiblely had more chance until now: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue and leaks at the level of the oil pipe connection, it is indicated in a position taking published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure".
Rolls-Royce manufactured reactors equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas, which had to emergency land on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now undertaken legal prosecution against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint to a federal court of Australia whose headquarters in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal measures against the company.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce said his company would claim damage in respect of the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were removed and the bearing surface was damaged during the fire of the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with question reactors.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all stakeholders.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, by precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest line aircraft in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transportation
Germany all covered with white: In one night, snow fell over almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people were killed in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany crash: By ice temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow in Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
The traffic is strongly restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked permanently, but they couldn't end the snow that was still accumulating.
Furthermore, violent raws have crushed the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tide races to take place in the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clusters on highways and federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather warning plant Meteomedia announced the violet warning level was announced in Saxony Switzerland: in fact, it’s the highest level.
By places, there has fallen 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt land, police have announced serious road disturbances.
On the motorway A2, snow and wind led to a traffic interruption and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls touched the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious traffic disruptions occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fell on the railways, catenars or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop his trip.
The sappers and paramedicals had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and drinks.
Snow winds broke the roads.
The Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer many, despite that there are only 400 beds available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level passage.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level passage because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car toned on a sliding path in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will turn around in the event of slight wrinkles.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by heavy and fast winds.
It is very cold, however, up to 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
According to newspapers, the deutsche Bank seeks to separate its emblem: According to newspapers, the financial institution is seeking acquirers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; while the bankers had to return to their former service place.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover renovation costs and seeks an acquirer for its two buildings, as writes the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, citing a spokesman.
This spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, “We check whether it’s more interesting to occupy or sell the buildings ourselves, and to re-rent them later.”
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has ever given up its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for EUR 272 million from the owners of capital and then rehabilitated them.
Transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, drowned around €200 million.
Of course, a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed "green towers", at around 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently not known whether the real estate will be resold to a fund belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry for minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried minors who were declared dead as a result of several explosions occurring in a mine.
We couldn't get the bodies back yet because the safety situation of the sinister well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age was between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to go down to the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be raised up.
Today, parents and friends organized a party to memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The personal photos and objects, including clothes and surfing boards, also had their place there.
The flags were put in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told memorial parties that New Zealand has fed up the hope that minors would go back to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the graves said he cannot resign to accept the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
South African and British miners also buried during the first explosion of November 19.
The rescuers began to turn off a fire inside the coal mine on the Southern Island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas mass is moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to Hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", the epic of the fighter.
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he turned "Walhallla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) having only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his bullion and, with almost overnatural strength, removes his opponents one after one another. This seems ideal for young male spectators to wait for a bloody action, just because our heroes use methods of assassing without.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the busty says no word about his true name. Even the other characters leave escape, at least, the circle of one or two sentences a few terrifying cry of agony.
Otherwise, there is nothing to say and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which is the decoration of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his style-filled trilogy related to drug dealer, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most of the artistic movie supporters must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads around and in the intestines.
Enthusiasts of action films die of boredom, when the bull embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a vessel to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and foam before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has found no movie distributors in Germany and there is only under the DVD format.
It is especially because of the beautiful images of the misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a palpiting film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not dialogue in this film, nor a consistent action, it’s everything atmosphere, a fevery dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn gives him barely a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lughy sound band, but especially with an unfailing hatred that flows out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully alongside the bull, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than everything, the hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents crazyness, but maybe also, only for those who are crazy anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic movie that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of acceleration, enthusiasm and astonism.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthquake works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take position on this topic, even less to submit to the agency's controls.
At night from 5 to 6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I hunting planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the euphrate; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers away: Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in the IAEA documents, as it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing of the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would allow to manufacture atomic weapons.
This technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation with flawless satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant representing a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information than at the time, and even over time, the mystery is increasingly thickening.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but had few indices showing that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and talk only about a "supposed reactor", even though they consider the presentation of the CIA as "pleasurable".
Their lack of tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he makes sure he has a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave Laconian answer in the summer by claiming that the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians have certainly with precipitation removed the decays of the "unused military building" and performed a methodical planning of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in El-Kibar.
In addition, IAEA has received satellite images from trade providers thanks to a Member State showing the moment that directly followed the attack. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles calling it unlikely.
Since that time, ladies have refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El-Kibar site and refuse access to the decays of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said, “We will never comment on this.”
This is how the investigation on this case has been extended since June 2008 without achieving a result and "becoming increasingly a serious issue of credibility of the Agency," as a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna recognizes, ultimately it is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities it is here, what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known in the IAEA respectively under the names Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah of the names of neighbouring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf which would most likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly next to it; that's exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, the Syrians are afraid that the inspection group is actually spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone paralleleped to carry substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production".
It would not have "no indications regarding sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions concerning the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the bomb would have been later separated.
It is unknown whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, have been stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of land-loaded trucks are disappeared, no one will have information about the storage site of the engravings.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see whether it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken earthquake work in the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
This may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to remove suspicions.
It is said in the diplomatic environments that the IAEA has spent several months drawing up a plan for inspections to be carried out. This plan was to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time invested shows how great interest in this case are done by inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also defeated this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. Ambassador, who has been mentioning for a few months what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means of the Atomic Agency to implement.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already talked about “an option I am open to in the future,” but he still hesitated.
This means involves a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the IAEA Governors Council and a lot of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see an escalation.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who reflects: "It would be useful, if at the end they find nothing."
Love in War Times
It’s gone bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that a woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serb bully during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were displaced in Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is UNHCR goodwill ambassador.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago she proposed these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined that offer.
“The meeting must be held in Bosnia,” says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says long enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of Ambassador of Goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, after a few hesitation granted a shooting authorization in Sarajevo, but we do not know why not then came despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that by making a lot of efforts she has made aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and claims that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and gives all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported into the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This, however, constitutes a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves his bullion."
That Jolie's movie began long before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, as Jolie is expressed, is "unfair and based on wrong information."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, as many others before.
Let's get out!
Tonight, everything goes well with the Irish people again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team excessively dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry out of joy on the background of strong music, they throw their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in Southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis bullets at a distance of three meters in the opponent’s team’s beer beets.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner hits 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the World Beer-pong Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle game to drink and the booked computer, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the threatening issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct employment interviews in New Zealand.
“I feel a strange feeling, however,” he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have any jobs."
Finally, her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has recruited her desired job as an event project charger, perhaps a good sign," the young man said smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social assistant, resides in Sydney, and her brother Colin now occupies a IT consultant position in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island resembles the situation of tanners.
Experts at the Institute of Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even anticipate a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecast is achieved, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief now takes the whole place.
The economic crisis, however, affects especially the well-trained Irish young people who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social default appeared absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes abundantly the letters of readers written by young migrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going to drive."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunities, goes away and our country goes a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave the light turns out."
Leanne Caulfield, chairman of the Irish student union, sees pointing a darker future because the government only throws powder in the eyes and offers no future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have any strategy to create new jobs,” said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her companions cramping from a practical internship unpaid to another.
She says that it is her biggest concern is to migrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" trade fair that offers full support on the theme "work abroad".
“But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the levels of the professional hierarchy,” the official said.
Its website shows photos of Australian surfers and Canadan snow surfers.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house is just out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workplace, in order to be able to complete refund of the contracted credit to build his home in the home country.
“The situation is already a bit mad,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost no longer live."
It breaks out of a embarrassed laughter by crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-taken front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access paths.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the common house with his sister for a amount of €380,000, funded at 100 percent by credit.
“These were moments of crazyness, undoubtedly money was easy,” he said.
Is he afraid to see everything fall down because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, resorts hot tea and says, "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn’t like the lamentations he often hears in recent times.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not even as dramatic as we once lived here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not what can happen worse, perhaps that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last big economic crisis.
“He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life simply continued.”
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his palms, He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for himself and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that is very worried about him in the last few days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said while drinking a long beer.
"A goodbye, it still seems worrying."
“Let’s rather call it a goodbye evening, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that for private business.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, he follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements appear from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the surrounding Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has risen after it has suffered a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Table 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents in the region declared satisfied with how their country's democracy worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Approximately 34% said they had confidence in their country’s parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but heavily increased compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
Although this did well during the global financial crisis, it was certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only suffered a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has only increased slightly in 2009 and has again declined to 32 percent this year.)
But the mood varies significantly from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is a widely shared feeling of progress.
This is rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that themselves or one of their relatives were victims of a criminal act over the past year; nevertheless, this figure is decreasing compared to 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private business and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private business is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (cf. graph 6).
About 58% estimate that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are in this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, declined by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An unclean vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinister and fearful country.
Electoral boxes and a new election were presented, vote bulletins scattered in the boxes, slaughtered vote offices and intimidations
The voting offices were open late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who have been displaced as a result of the January earthquake, went to the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several suspected favorites, have denounced fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Sometimes violent protests have exploded throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, considers the event "a fairly good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, had necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are debted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
Both opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second bull reached the second round.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, we were afraid that participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
Weeks after suddenly becoming widow, the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate of 20 points to more than 50%; it is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this into a successful campaign for a second mandate in a next year election could depend on Mrs. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, that she would or not abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded her as president, was used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority at Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was darkened in the disastrousness following Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement at power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentary member hit one of his peers in the face and where others accused the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the president an even greater margin of manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is widely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and unions’ salary claims see this figure nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out counterfeiting official inflation statistics.
Can Ms. Fernández now modify these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports.
However, inflation erupted the increase in growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that's why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bondmakers who had refused prior forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as usual.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the INDEC sanitation.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer alongside her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very prominent.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for it will have refluxed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to revoke or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
Half-hour for China
Taiwan voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented on 27 November, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal advisors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings of the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of the relationships with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My successful test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan’s complete independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has dropped by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwan elections, including closing campaign trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal dress.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, held an electoral tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A crowd man shot on young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, hurting him and killing a passenger.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or solve a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by leading suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how absent the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, candidates played with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid halting its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also abstained from attracting the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr Ma, on his part, claimed a confirmation to see if his policy on China was acceptable for the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the government of Beijing will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy aimed at deceiving Taiwan, to return to the bargain.
China has not wasted time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison as a result of accusations of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates was born under Ms. Tsai's management and the PDP is working to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without prerequisites.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" compared to Mr. Ma's rapid approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exaggerated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to break the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty to choose from its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspective of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite an overwhelming economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his cabinet and local antennas will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for approaching is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwans see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, “the point of non-return has already passed.”
Nominations to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Make it at the request of a president, and people are required to get aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked by President Obama to take place at his Nobel Peace Award ceremony in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale appointment in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, Esperanza, the appointment remains a little mysterious but is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and given his slightly engaging voice style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed to Spalding compared with the last success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the Grammy electors.
In other places, the Grammy Awards voters fairly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the category "instrumental album", a spin on a refreshing shot of a recording that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of Veteran Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of Keyboarder John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favorite to New Orleans' raw voice and frequently invited to HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also heavily focuses on a certain merger with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, gained some well-deserved recognitions in the big category; in competition with the rich chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his live chief was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bass group.
Nomination of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Head of the nominations, cites "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commanded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also in a lice for a reward.
The classic nominations are divided into 13 categories covering records of orchestra, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey's of the Boston Modern Orchestra and Synergy.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Love of Far" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsche Symphonie-Orchestra Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion the Sithrin
The composers in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassonately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wander Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solist instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer in Los Angeles said that he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the interpreter to Mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North African range and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old orchestra chief Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the category of orchestra services, for leading the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees of vocals and soloists; here are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixture category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Temecula Mosque won the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticians took over the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and trafficking.
But the Commissioners decided Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention it,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
“I am proud of it, as an American citizen.”
"This shows that justice wins."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronounced for or against the center, at speech time almost as well, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There's no longer America," a speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of the monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also raised protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, place of the attacks of 11 September 2001, carried out in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her 135-family congregation co-exists without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
She would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" form of life, commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday's Science journal.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss this, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
"The discovery shows that in other planetary environments, organizations might be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of the elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Spatial Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not a member of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a casual discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono as it is equipped with high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; therefore, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"Accordingly, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough to not work exactly as phosphorus; it enters inside and, somehow, goes the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Deputy Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth’s existence, she said; thus, researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found, the sheriffs of the Los Angeles County announced it Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Wales pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
“The good news is that dogs are going well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good forms."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, and what circumstances were their discovery.
"An investigation is ongoing."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff’s deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old male, and Didi, a ten-month-old female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were taken away until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the Long Beach AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions for other events planned in the days before the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the nearly a month of the couple’s dog exhibition tour.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their truck outside just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spanish - who stayed with them in the room of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and the Corgis, with the thicker leather, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little opened the windows, so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the flight of the truck at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, the restructuring of MGM is no longer waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained green light to start again at zero.
A federal New York bankruptcy judge officially rent the "prepacked" plan by creditors on Thursday that about $5 billion of debt would be erased; opening the way to the entertainment company, 86 years old, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal barriers remain before MGM to float under the guardianship of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become CEOs of what will be a lightweight studio.
Staff will be returned to approximately 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility planned to finance new MGM transactions and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was committed to advising the management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders, among whom none of them were ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything needed to be done again while the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, who collected $375,000 a month for their business management services, will receive a $4 million “success prize”.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to launch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the leading shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although the leading candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s Kinect video game system, both can make a significant break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Furthermore, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the battery button toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are pelvis toys of the size of a pig from India that sing a note when you press them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live’s last year’s technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-to-play games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have eased the toy uses Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled with questionnaire gaming cards designed to turn a car hike into a session with a self-correction and a valve maker.
If you are desperate when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it is the first largest revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and newer screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Lastly, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a lighter box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to train words by placing the blocks online before time runs, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling competition.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pets from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items available.
It can be roulette skates or a pets Puffle toy.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest battery-button micro-robots.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Give a smoother side to maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin arpented a city square as an urban sergeant in training, severely inspecting his nerve burdens, emitting low-voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the women’s members of Chengguan – imposing public order leaders in China, feared and contemplated for their arbitrary repression and inclination for violence – to convey some impression to a set of spectators.
"Be right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What the beautiful girls look like!"
Four girls who barely spent the teenage age in white gloves, dressed in the same jackets and pants of olive colour, stood at the guard.
Four pair of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four perfectly taken care of hats at the top of the hair attached by a scratched node in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," Mr. Tang said, with denial.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city required that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack truck by launching black eyes firmly for half an hour until the colporter turned his affairs back and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big picture operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, gap and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties in attracting the ground-based urban brigade of China.
And for this reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them while scattering a protest against a waste discharge.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and published online, describes how to effectively defeat criminals without sending blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pasta carrier was abandoned with brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violence-impregnated video game, available by downloading online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in the attack of street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," China Daily lamented last year, a national publication, after an onset controversy on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
Scepticians say the approach is far away.
After the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were only a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 and 22 years of age, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, i.e. 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The officers said the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
“It’s their image that’s important,” said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"Firstly, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; it is about size, weight, face traits, etc.
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women in Chengguan are like vases with flowers, he said, adding, "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the face traits.
This means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Individuals with disabilities or disfigured should not apply.
"We can't let a person who boxes or a boss come to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommed cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the highlight of her appearance as a gender, she says.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked from an abused air.
Her 21-year-old colleague Xu Yang says, "Our job is to present the picture of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate to be limited, they said, because they feed greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen ambulant merchants who move quickly by foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little breads or tofu pockets as possible before leaving.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you it several times," Ms. Xu said while a seller fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her bike charlett.
Agents describe their functions as rather monoton than harsh.
“It’s almost the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, a 20-year-old, who study marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offencers to their male seniors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of enemy against bureaucracy that are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two squares of placide square Baoguang, where female gender officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the road rather than in a store, as regulation imposes them.
The motorcycle owner shouted on the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with a sinister face, had broken a shot-out path to their vehicle and went all-speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female gender officers, coordinators - men 40 years or older - play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we are fighting verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said with a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that begins.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced Senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential, until the scandal around his affair makes the big national titles last year and harms his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from a one-year investigation.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of investigation and he was not intended to maintain any charge against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from comments on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence that Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case with her Senator.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was forbidden by the law to lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems in contradiction with the so-called ban on the lobbying rotary door.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be a prima facial evidence of a plot to violate and substantial violation of the Rotary Door Act," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of customers from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be dissatisfied of political prosecutions after a number of high-level accusations incurred by his section of public integrity, including the decision taken last year to abandon the prose against Steve T.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking weapons, said Melanie Sloan, Citizens’ Director General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Attorney of Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the next day, saying that the department did not seek charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of attorneys had cooperated with the prosecutors to attempt to persuade them that the Senator, as his office reaffirmed it on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable to enter the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except to say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, suggesting that payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents at Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral committee said she did not have enough evidence to prove that money was everything except a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "martelling" the Ministry of Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after committed Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the news of the case appeared last year, Ensign apologised to his voters and resigned from his leadership position in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to break a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, her spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the hearing room.
They sent reports of horrible testimony every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and the children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements in the court that skies appeal arguments, which may occupy the courts for years.
What is provocating is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread use by Twitter journalists - created a "cirque atmosphere", a so widespread and instant saturation with burning details that the jury has been poorly influenced by public passions.
The request could push appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in hearing rooms.
"I have experienced it during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the hearing rooms infringes the human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney at Hayes.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Higher Court of State, laconistly rejected the claims in the judgment made last week, claiming that the media was "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury would have been carried out by passion.
But this doesn’t seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court cancelled the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeal courts arrested to review a half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from hearing rooms could allow proceedings more fairly.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also say, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and his daughters, Hayley, 17-year-old, and Michaela, 11-year-old.
Defense lawyers say they will also contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurys, who had been critical before the prosecutors, and abusively pressed for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jury has not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that computing media would stop attracting the flames of the affair’s emotion.
“The daily twitters of media, cameras and journalists in front of the justice palace,” the lawyers wrote, “seem to nothing of what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the instantaneous news was more burning than the slower releases was a Luddist view that would deplete the Court’s policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said the appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insisted on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that overthrew Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the media coverage of the trial and said they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This affair," they wrote, "represented that of Sheppard v. Maxwell from the 21st century."
Can civility bring the clives closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negative, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a forward-looking sign of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders on Tuesday did not produce any breakthroughs on major issues to be dealt with during the “lamed canard” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polished discussion about the differences of both sides and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to be governed, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The President’s deficit committee’s public meeting on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that several months' close interaction has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but that, however, still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of mutual trial and test in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while attempting to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience for renewed partisan warfare.
This is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments of the participants disclosed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or duties, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
“It’s inevitable after the elections.
The elections raises supportive passions and then they are destroyed.
It's fine."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or assembly, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allocations, because Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment compensation for unemployed workers.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on issues discussed during the "lamed canard" session, with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institution, warned that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th congress will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to true cooperation.
“I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacular or shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event,” he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to meet their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, including reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, removing retirement age and reducing expenditures.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the issue of public agenda deficit in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected, which suggests that there are at least few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues today.
Galston plans two phases in the struggles between the White House and the Republicans of the Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of supporting confrontations, given that the Republicans dispute Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; to then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supporting spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Anyone who will be judged in loss will have to change his way and find compromises.
But this would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there appears to be a greater ideological difference between Obama and the Congress Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both parties’ activists see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort from both sides to find an agreement ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents describe Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and leads to the Kremlin part of the winning pots and protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a February note.
Police and the Federal Security Service make huge rackets that contribute to explaining the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part as money walks upstairs.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expulsed.
It was written while Youri Loujkov was still Mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
It was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have been few traces of cleaning since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these accusations.
In September, he declared the following to a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the city government of Moscow and crime has led some people to appoint it as "dysfunctional" and claim that the government worked more as a kleptocracy than a government, according to the Embassy note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means " roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the Attorney's Office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the city government of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD, and militias are at the second level."
"Ultimately, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB burns the money of the largest companies and that the police target small companies.
One source, he said, explained that Moscow’s corporate owners understood that it was better to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (subsequently than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.
"This is why the demand for criminal gang protection is no longer as high."
The note indicates that although the collection of money is extended, protection itself can be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their things close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption, but he has admitted little progress.
The embassy note transmits reporting accounts of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, Moscow's "think tank Indem" director.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because it doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the entire Russian corruption costs would be more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the U.S. Embassy, which was only realized last night, late in Moscow's time, will certainly remove dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Lujkov could be blamed, to a certain extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin issued the assumption that WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted angry to the words that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling Batman and bringing near Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we would not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Former Khmer Red Fighters Compelled to Fight the Past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with poor-quality concrete walls, Anlong Veng’s head of high school mentioned the man who built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he was careful about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the buffer" for his brutality, when he was head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Red Khmers northwest of Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long-time loyalty was finally challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to publicly face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of its former soldiers.
In July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, pronounced its first sentence concerning a former Red Khmer member, condemning former chief of Tuol Sleng’s sadly-famous torture center Kaing Khek Yev, better known as Duch, at 35 years of prison.
In the face of this development, anxiety increased with the former Anlong Veng Red Khmer fighters, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There are resentments and fear among the ancient red Khmers but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization conducting regime research.
“For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“The situation generates divisions within families.”
Under the reign of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overthreatening.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Uni government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of red Khmer fighters began to defeat the government, culminating with the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held a head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for his trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the former red Khmer fighters have been darkened in the black misery, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for depositing the weapons, they are unskilled farmers in low grade and file.
“These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are infiltrated with the utopic agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice cultivator.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to support our own needs.”
The Red Khmer Court has also caused concerns here.
The court should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the leading responsible for crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It needs more to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, a 64-year-old, former district chief in the Banteay Meanchey province under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodia’s Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, on a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a ground path outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go there.
“Cambodia is in peace and stable,” she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that an instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he said.
“We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng young people know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
“They distrust themselves because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will pursue.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by the weed and sealed with plastic bags, leads to a black silk rectangle, covered with a roof of roast sheet.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire stack after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old cell phone seller on the road edge, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's anniversary and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-quality uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was released in a joint statement published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarus Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margin of a security summit.
The U.S. government has tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarus research center.
This opened the way to an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a official who spoke of the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement “very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus President Alexandre Lukachenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and weakly enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“This is our product ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, demonstrating interest in achieving an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that has traveled more than 1,300 miles until a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, the officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with weakly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specialized in the World Threat Reduction.
According to estimates of the James Martin Non-Proliferation Studies Centre, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to remove its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the hard repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While congratulating progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government hasn’t issued any objection to the CIA flights
The government has made no objection to the flights of the CIA with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners towards Guantanamo through Spain, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by Wikileaks' filtered (cable) documents on El País, which added that the first vice president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to "demonstrate that they exercise adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft across Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing complicity in human rights-contrary practices to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero outside the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights above Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "capture them out of charge," says Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive would "give this case the lower profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence."
In January 2007, Attorney Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the CIA Department of Defense on Flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information,” the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States has shown its concern for "appealing coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented to him that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and do what they consider adequate," he had given instructions to his employees "to avoid comments of a flaming rhetoric."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States.”
The parnicide that went to the confession complained to be a mother in a network
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Fear to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; both of them originating in Noia, the village of Coruña from which she originates.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship with Iván Tuñez, industrialist in 1998.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, they knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a fasting man of Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is heard that their idylles have broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Minorca and writes, "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it appeared to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If it doesn't like him, let him leave the child with my mother, and I'll take him when I go home," she said.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm going, but I'm going to stay there only until the 19th, because the 20th I'm going to attend a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is to say with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July there is another post.
When she hits it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, was dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not on another."
“One side he is with me and this place likes him a little, but another side he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
“There’s going (the child) at a few hours of summer and so I’ll save some money from the babysitter.”
On 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big bite from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto said he sent you, I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another one: "The child is good, el goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there’s one: “He’s ahead of money.”
On the Internet, she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of prison."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, watch, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had passed so she hadn’t told her that she was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday the provincial prison office of Palma, from the Minorque judicial prison center.
The office lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she doesn't remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor."
Before she had admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and laid her corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor sought a psychiatric trial.
Popular Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the significant increase in votes and members recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted generals because, although there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training in these committees normally doubles the number it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans gained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomy, they gained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired for a vote deviation from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PCP could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in the Congress, while CiU would also win from 4 to 9 (not less in the PSC)
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a member -- he has three now -- while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for municipal committees, where populars can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fantastic that this training loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in all four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, including the mayor, Ángel Ros, maintained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Besides the seven inmates in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained by officers of the Barcelone Police General Information Officer formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba was the Last Person at Letland"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to ensure that with the “Kampai Operation” the Al Qaeda’s international counterfeit apparatus has “summer debility” and “consequently its operational capacity.”
Investigators estimate that the cell, within the two years in which it was active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were counterfeited and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, which is why the investigations participated in, besides Thai services, other European police units, which is why there could be the following days in the European Union's territory similar shots to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were held in Thailand another, with the capture of the Muhammad Athar-Buthan and Sirhan-Buthan.
They were those who led the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - whose part was hit in 2009 - was mainly flying passports from tourists that satisfied the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Investigators point out that so far no detail has been found that connects detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, even though the author of this attack, Laskar e Taiba, was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeit in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before the attack was committed, Catalonia has been sent through a transfer agency of a few miles of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that have been used afterwards by the integrators of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have taken a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and who summarizes to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of national-souvernemental adventures to his desires as the complementary.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the safety of having earned 18 members of the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the trainings that the opposition will abstain in the vote of the investor.
Possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but at the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in the key of Catalan.
And as regards the President of the PP, to support an investment "well need to eliminate all sovereign and independentist speeches," and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have their common bet to reduce the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and eliminate the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas's investment will be taken care of by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatric states that the dead were not due to "lack of measures"
Olot’s center owners don’t eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 older people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly persons he was responsible for in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the centre’s lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that “La Caritat’s desire would be the desire to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible” for the dead but “legality and responsibility force us to assume the processual situation of civilian officials.”
And besides social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a major compensation that the legal representatives of victim parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients from the Geriatrics - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was taking place by phone.
The Caritate, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that “the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened.”
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only an indice of imprudence from anyone other than the accused.”
The person already baptized as "The Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused him to death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the center staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila doesn't lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them lessive as he already confessed he did with the three women he killed in the interval of 12-17 October.
The Caritate does not believe the night nurse's statements, nor the number of confessed assassinations, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number to be greater and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in his visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logic in the change of how to kill after successfully committed eight assas.
That is why they state that they will remain available to justice to clarify the scope of facts.
ECB threatens
Investors suddenly reacted yesterday to Trichet’s threat that warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have closed to force and European banks’ shares have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not also underestimate the ability of the ECB to mislead and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worried signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it crashes, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative position locks.
The institutional investor will late lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw for the fourth time tomorrow in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures at the end and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly auction sale will be maintained with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to blind to remove the liquidity measures, let God help us!
As during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be believing and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday, the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, and clearly reflected a change in market feeling after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potentials, and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are sound to hears of investors like the four Vivaldi seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, double the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it solves with a high demand and helps to dissolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, appearing."
Courage, we can get out of it!
President of Eulen will dispute the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will dispute, because he considers him "nol of law," the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to argue their majority and take up the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
It was excluded from his Board of Directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves administrators at the shareholders' assembly of 18 January this year whose dispute was registered in the Trade and Societies Registry.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16th, convened by Madrid’s Commercial Magistrate Number 2, opened again the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate court of his five sons to try, through a prosecutive argument, clearly fraudulent the Law and abusing the law, validating and correcting the radically zero assembly on 18 January," according to his 18th January.
This argument will be the basis for the dispute once the assembly takes place, considering that it is "nol of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convoke an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks the use of 51% of capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantial issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for dispute for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
A software creates improvements in real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this selection world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stage that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Without decreasing the skill as a pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the “secret weapon” that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with targets far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument was used to create assembly chains of factories manufacturers from around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it in a real way, avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in short hours, almost in real time”, the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stairs had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today works 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes to the boils.
Siemens’ leader explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull bullets except the engine, which is Renault’s exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a unique limitation of this folly of technological development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull deployed the high-tech factory to create and produce its boils in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notorious.
The factory’s technology manager Steve Nevey said five years ago that R&D progress in racing cars would bring 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of value added.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20-square-meter network that the multinational company plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-mark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave an example the remade store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third one.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be interactively affected), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global-level pioneer pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s guarantee computer equipment.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht, Holland.
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
“This system is specially designed for MPAs and users, as major companies have already contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on ‘they’ a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell’s delegated administrator Jaime Guardiola thinks that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially compensate with increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell is waiting to capture a million customers in three years, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the three years to come and be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new steering plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year vault.
The objective, except to survive without recourse to FROB’s public grants, is to gain a market rating by collecting a million new customers – 700,000 if deducted those who can get out of the bank – its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had destroyed more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rate for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity betting, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks dare now set goals and make them public because the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will complete this year’s managing plan Optima, established four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further exercise.
Customers who leave the savings boxes escape will be their primary goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
In fact, the executive believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking affairs, he said.
And even though he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already move at the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We didn't tighten the crank, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November-.
He also confessed that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s steering plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of conducting corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "will be requested for greater dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "grow greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
He also mentioned that the FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has decreased the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot emit, but unlike what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among boxes
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings boxes and again emphasized the rapidity with which the sector's restructuring is undertaken.
When the Spanish savings boxes concentration trial began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and reserved themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been completely accomplished; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the guardianship of the Bank of Spain, who has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "accomplished at the highest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is accomplished within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank.
“The passage of 45 caxes with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is a unequal trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much bigger to conform to Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of fairly unhappy opinions about the slow process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is reminded that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and “probably” in the world and attributed a “lack of knowledge” to those who doubt it.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic conjunction, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings boxes, a system that began a "very important" concentration process and "going at the highest speed possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has well drawn up the stress tests ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of €426 of unemployed assistance without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, managing the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the states.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel as to her responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not an error in his communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction of the difficult redefinition process of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible outflows of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark’s recovery, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and expansion of costs to the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of difference between what Germany thought to be done (tax rigor plans and public finance stability) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second coup in the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since that time she was subjected to a ferocious criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time require private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, as it has hastened the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although a little sweet, has been approved, and in the following months we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has traced a red line that it doesn’t think is crossing.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take steps with which we may not be too agreed, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that breach the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be obliged to declare a cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a cost party.
Germany reports that we need to follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive outside balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the payment balance, such as that which presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead us to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the opportunity we have given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it from this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the Saturday’s meeting with major companies and the announcement of yesterday’s new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticism, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are considered, it is not possible to exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone that is too drunk of little serious countries.
In this case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Alonso’s and Ramos’s rushes against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has flowed a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before completing the match (which their team had already won clearly), the two players deliberately wasted their time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow cardboard.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will finally be the leader of its group, the two players will fulfil the regulatory penalty during the next match of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to move without cardboards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho, and different economic sums to players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it takes part of ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the reported case is due to the fact that this has had as a protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in his hymn shows nobility and honor and in past occasions condemned his players to a fine for similar acts) and to his orchestrate drama, he seems, by Mourinho, to a more technical story.
In any case, the debate asks whether such behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., whether with such actions we commit a fraud of law; because they are in fact actions respectful with the sports regulation, but seem to equal its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause in the sports mind.
One of the goods that include the sports mind is the physical integrity of the adversary players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put into danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which you are referred to with the right game is to avoid the team of infringe players unfairly benefiting from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate that it is usually characterized as fraud of law, as its violation of the rules has not been carried out in a hidden way to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another question is the type of advantage that infringers obtain from the intentional mistakes examined.
Here it seems necessary to find that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club couldn’t rely on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cardboards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be removed suddenly and except that, with this action players perform a sanction match and pass to the second cardboard cycle, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the steps, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sports mind, which is part of strategic decision-making which promotes the maximum profit of what rules allow.
In our case, players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they have rather chosen the time when they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without disturbing the penalty or fleeing the penalty.
Even though the border between engineering and law fraud is spread, I think in this occasion we had a clear case of engineering.
It seems to me that the controversy appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the director transmits to cause them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offered to catch Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a avalanche of bookings for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and lottery, when December arrives, group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive you price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or associations, coinfalls and men.
To complete the complication of accounting, this year’s calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvester falls Friday) focused on requests in the week of December 13, resulting until now in a dinner reservation avalanche for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Anything is the conjuncture, they all call for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauración de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before booking.”
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to descend a step with the crisis, so that the range around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various facilities in the center, we see the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 properties in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a growth in billing since the second semester and good, although focused, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine manufactured by the Champagne-cave method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the Fecasarm employer (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts the opportunity to begin seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that the reservations are generally "announced", even though customers "negotiate to the maximum."
This is true, hope in celebrations has not fallen, indifferently from who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks’ leaks confirm the connection between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the lighting and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the accredited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the instable Asian country produces a "faster" other than the world of nuclear weapons.
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are hidden by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concerns in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor, James Jones: “The proximity to some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of transportation of atomic materials.”
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and a reason to maintain the custody.
“Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decrease in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a meeting with US homologues.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the higher Pakistani degree of nuclear weapons production.
A message from the Embassy in May, which calls the communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", supports the following: "Transparency is frequently inexistent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the official that “the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support to terrorist groups.”
At the Hunt of the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will count a senior responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow Assange’s movements.”
Nevertheless, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise dated November 20.
And he has nothing to do with the last discharge of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ creator lawyer Mark Stephens assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20th international police body headquartered in Lyon (France) dictated the order on request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of the country.
So, the 188 Interpol countries have received the indication to identify or localize Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red call indicates a free path for arrest -- which the national police body has to accomplish -- especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as is the case of Sweden.
The movement indignated Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer the Swedish authorities’ questions by video-conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the license to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," she denounced.
While the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he didn't silence.
On Monday he granted an interview with Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving U.S. graduates orders that they stack to the United Nations by violating the international treaties the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridicule and absurd."
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should be interested in us," he told CNN.
Obama himself charged a senior anti-terrorist official, Rusell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the opinions that Conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the State Department to study the possibility to include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, a advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after said Assange would have to "be murdered."
“Obama should turn it into a goal and use a crewless aircraft or something similar.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, minister of Baptist, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not an execution would be a too kind punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with clins of eyes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party to a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the first internal revolt within the ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches as he had with other extinct currents.
That’s why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticism with climbs that allow him to blind up until the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By vote bulletins, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to send a certain vote of penalty to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half more one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than making his position available to the military, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the Strategic Reorientation Paper, which the Board will submit to the National Board's vote on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the Congress to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider as a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all to be able to wash its family laundry.
In this line, the article that current counselor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologist, the holder of Innovation thought that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the military, i.e., to include new figures that come from the Carod's appropriate sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once for all the assembly as a operational mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congress through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion was responsible for the management to revise the assembly model at a specific congress for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors at the point, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the state of Mexico, a decline of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
The assassinations include three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory of organized crime.
Among the cases is mentioned that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms and the hit thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage port of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early Thursday morning, on four, land owners jointly exploited found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Salt, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shoots when he left his house to initiate waste collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a fire attack at the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front we found a man's corpse on a solitary path from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet beaten with caliber 25 firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies conducted a comprehensive search for the rest of the body’s members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, hands attached behind and eyes tied.
The man had a wound produced by a gun shot in his neck.
By half of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in covers and abandoned in a vehicle box on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza was reported, and at the same time with the victims two warning messages of death was discovered.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrectible.
On 17th, wrapped in covers, two women were found in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreeing with a message left to his executors.
In Ixtapaluca, with guns in the neck we found a woman's lifeless body in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman, it has been detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, on the edge of a car, a man's body was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with the enrubnated head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "That's what happens with those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapped in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains objectives of reducing greenhouse gas
The representative of the country at the COP16 assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce coal traces and detailed that he keeps his offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, representative of the country at the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he said clearly that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this field.
He mentioned that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot program support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed in reducing greenhouse gas, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans ongoing or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and governments of other countries.
For example, he said, the Efficient Energy Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the Private Initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the shift of incandescent lamps by saving lamps, and another mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than we think.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Spino: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist Leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Spino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez declared convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been a approach to local elections that has succeeded and achieved its goal,” he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition doesn’t afraid us; on the contrary, we taste it and makes it stronger,” he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader / leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give it to "the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party's president office to any of the five."
He anticipated that the party’s recovery recorded in the July 4 elections will be reflected on the next dispute, even if “it’s not yet the time to think about 2012.”
"For the moment it is about to accompany Governor Gabino Cue in this task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so we have made "a lot of hopes on them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet expectations."
When PRI's criticism against President Felipe Calderón was asked because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of 'cabinet'," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no balloon in the country, and less of censorship.
Obama Promotes Law for Students Without Papers on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call for senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté said.
President Barack Obama today met with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call for senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains an open cyberlink to a broader document that requests the public to immediately contact the senators, as the vote for legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush's tax reductions and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is solved, we can fix an award for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in the country in the last five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, in times when the project supporting organisations protagonists are intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courtized Republicans there are the senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of his Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they would not support it in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the bigger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants stretched out the narrative.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the invited writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (dependent on another round table) was Sex.
The finger on the wound "...we put in embarrassment," Argentine writer gently launched to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to which they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "pleasure" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sounded relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is in reality open and it doesn't exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a beautiful narrative entitled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With touchs of magical realism, he talks about a famous horrific that touched clouds, turned people who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a dames had lost, a narrative that turned to then speak America, the great news that had had from the beginning its own columnists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticated the exces of the narrative.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an aware manner we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked pureness."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lie, we no longer know what part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its top.
This is called the "tradition of Cervantes".
“Thanks to his legacy, we are what we tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero announced and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL's invitation with her round table Le debt on the wound.
Cuba-Porto-Iraq has put its own on the great wound of the social violence across its country - and Latin America shares - produces disputes in trafficking and drug sales.
“I think good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditation,” she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a “chemical reaction” of this last.
The evening is finished with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also emphasized "this must be on the wound of the committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed as well in regard to intellectual habits and control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, “behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
“To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must shade: and shade means a lot of times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable by thinking of caricature, white and black, established ideas and without shade, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a white and black world,” he said.
Romano at the hunt of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he knew to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he knew to reach three times the decisive series, even though until now he has not put into the thousand and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine finally comforted himself with the sub-champ medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist Strategy arrived at his first final as coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the Morelia reins with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the total result of precisely Rayados 3-1.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered back again, because his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalties series he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and ultimately three of his players missed his 11-3 meters.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he doesn’t want to have the same sort, he tries to get rid of evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that the institution is more important for him.
“I want to be champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, it’s for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I’ll get the title, but what I’ve mentioned before is more important,” he said when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can retain is that until the arbitrator blows the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players can also, for the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run the end of the game, and I don't think it.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which doesn't worry about it, because he trusts his players: "We never seek to reach the penalty series, we're trying to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we're hoping to prepare, the previous tournament we've been prepared, unfortunately the title has served us a bad turn, sometimes are an anxing.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes rules for obtaining visa
People must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC, according to their English-language signs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide certain advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves at an interview with the Consular Representative; they will only present themselves at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their footprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the AUC, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service rate.
For more information on the new procedure to apply for the visa, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Alien Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will communicate tomorrow Thursday an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 p.m. at NASA’s headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that study the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” speculated experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that one thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility to become intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems to be talked about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that one thought was too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and that ability makes us think that similar life might exist on other planets that don’t have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know.”
The Space Agency will communicate the real scope of the discoveries at tomorrow’s news conference Thursday.
The conference will participate in geobiology Pamela Conrad, which study the possibility of living on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), in the perspective that his chemistry is similar to Earth’s.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Pattern 'block' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th was just settled when in the Congress appeared a block of opposition led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which declared independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of bipartism to the Chambers.
Prior to initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Act, since it excluded them,
With this reform, they reitered, we initiate “bipartism” because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four members, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they don’t have it, they will be again enslaved by both parties and in this way the opponent coalition will end.
“Until here has come (the opponent coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic."
“This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in the Congress.”
To begin, this group starts with five legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to be more numerous, the Convergent has abundated.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now turned into a ‘butin’ between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patron Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place to the negotiation tables.
"That they do not leave by currency agreements outside at five which will probably be nine members, now at five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiation table, that's the problem, that in the reform they made, that they decided, we are outside and we are not agreed with this reform."
$200 million more for “the supplier”
The town hall of Mazatlán pays another check to the questionnaire owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos favored by Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the town hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the latter check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, as a concept of "Supplier Account Liquidation".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and therefore, how many checks will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We haven’t bought anything, we just pay what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the State Official Journal, according to the forecast of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, had published a review of the cheques that the town hall issued to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennation of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, involving checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell in a hole of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the wrong state of the streets and roads has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see disorder and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without adequate planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the town hall.
“The municipality will have to take over its responsibility and avoid this going on again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective,” he said.
“We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because this is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the town happens to change its strategy to well maintain the city.”
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They haven't been paid the needed attention and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is notorious for everyone, the interview is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to put together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, ordered and to be attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put ourselves online to make them attractive in order to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP calls for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations he faces.
The business sector in Mazatlán seeks a worthy and free working legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces big problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 PAN members, three Party New Alliance, two PRD, one PT, one Convergence and one PVEM, in total 40 people’s representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrators of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations he faces.
“We hope that Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to secure their own interests and they become a carnival mascarade of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions.”
That is why I ask them to certifie the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor make progress.
“We will make sure they do a worthy and mostly committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces seeking the economic growth of the state, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate stimulations for investment and infrastructure and that will stimulate the generation of workplaces.”
With regard to tourism, he asked the new legislators to give it the importance it has in the Government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
“I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is unconcerned as a major economic activity and currency and investment generator and that rivals directly with the agro-industrie.”
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified for detonating tourism projects that help ensure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among others toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magic Kings will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, as their home is formed by no more or less than 12 people and one goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear their toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I'm going out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four-year-old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, three-year-old, would want a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-year-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him, 'We'll see, my son', because he was very dear," he remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, shoes size 12; Isaiah, 10, shoes size 10, while Miguel, 8, shoes size 8.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the Northwest reception.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estria on Wednesday as part of the removal of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were captured,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Safety of Quebec.
Overall, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons had to appear at the Sherbrooke court palace within the hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession in order to traffick, plot and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-run survey, which lasted nearly a year.
"It's the information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Quebec Safety Strike Regional Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regime took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration will continue without problems
The bill of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of clandestine migrant ships, will clearly be defeated while the three opposition parties made it known on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I rely strongly on the Charter.”
"I stand up with a party that created granite under your feet," Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff said, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would hold anyone from a vessel identified as transporting clandestine immigrants up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chief of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he goes to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD’s criticism in the field of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms that would not be sufficiently firm for clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against clandestine smugglers and this is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the Conservatives because it takes up refugees and imprison children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians massively tell members that they do not tolerate such illegal migration, those criminal operations targeting Canada and treating the country as a paillason."
“They expect Canada to take firm steps,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections to be rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote for each member who is opposed to be explained in front of its voters.
The new unit does not do unanimously
Despite the announcement of Jean Charest's possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to request the creation of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea did not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
The Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a Standing Council meeting on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no need for the Pequist critic in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "pin out of a hat" and "bricolated solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’re going to see the result when you’re going to announce it, just affirm it.”
"We are aware of that problem."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest is obstinated not to create this investigative committee, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
“The only way to have an inquiry commission is Jean Charest’s resignation,” says Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the auditor general to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the auditor-general," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent team is not the only project in the Charest government’s cartons.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to modify the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking at some amendments related to this case.
During the Spring 2001 Operation, which hit motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterstreams remain under high surveillance due to the heavy rainfall dropped in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were preventably evacuated.
On the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road fell down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall dropped in several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, according to regions.
The areas north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these rainfalls need to be added to the melting of the snow already accumulated in certain sectors, we fear the overflowing of several waterstreams.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Québec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers in St. Jerome, in the Laurentides, and the oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the area of Lanaudière, the strong precipitation resulted in the overflowing of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried out due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of some lakes led to the closure of several paths, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a warning foot and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, safe advisor.
The Quebec Raw Forecast Centre issued on Wednesday strong raw warnings for several rivers, including Maskinonge, L'Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec's radio animator Stéphane Dupont underwent a partial reversal in front of the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial speech on social assistance and Haitians as well as its gross wave language.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some statements contained “inaccurate information on social assistance, unfairly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasting during the day.”
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had suicided, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during emissions broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must present strong information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the vehiculed message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes issued by "Dupont le noon" have addressed a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame was held in his place.
The last dispute was on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then passed themselves into a face-to-face media that had caused many reactions.
CHOI’s animator said he had not given any donations to help the Haitians because we couldn’t know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an indefinitely negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it."
"My record has been virgin for a year and a half," the animator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of listening great within three days.
A King of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing goes on the tatami and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don’t like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, the person who worked as a security agent and committed to the UPS company has just issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association’s World Lovers Championship (WKA) from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
Currently, I’m preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup.”
"The fighters who finished among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
“In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth.”
“In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth-range tournament, while I arrived in Toronto third in 2009,” he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At that pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where handle and foot hits, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels occur originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist from this form of fighting is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely answer his presence at the Super Bowl of kung-fu's "King of Sanda" super tournament.
“This competition is the most prestigious and highest competition in China,” the sympathetic gaillard explained.
"This is a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are fighting in the final of their category."
“Then the winners of each category face themselves in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.”
450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the most important, the project management, for a sum of $295 million without tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 simultaneously with Hydro-Québec’s choice to entrust the private sector to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium declined the lucrative contract without any public bidding.
For the Party of Quebec, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that risks to eliminate competition and cause price rise.
“This is the new way to make collusion and destroy competition.”
“It is that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly,” Pequist Parliament Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he says hard to see how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly deniing that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my trip,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “unhonest” and had “lacked rigor.”
She said "it would be the least of things" than the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortiums is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a limited alliance over time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the extent of work.
The shop is underway and is scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition playing; there was negotiation.
Also, the formula of consortiums is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortiums in the engineering sector was investigated by the government.
A quick overflight from the Quebec Business Register allows to count more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its leading competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings to one and the same legal person, or Dessau.
As for the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds particularly since the 1970s."
The major manager of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it surprise that the project’s management contract was granted by will.
"If you go to bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
“You have two choices: whether you take people in that market and you say, we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price.”
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that is important, it’s the competence of people,” Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering-advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin gained 22 contracts, Genivar gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said the four firms composing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are “known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.”
Minister Normandeau said the PQ is also tied to those firms that "finance it" before it said it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but honestly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer is very little confidence on sustainable development actors, but also on fair brands and ecological certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even though he baths in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption are pullulating, he regrets a lack of credible information, the lack that he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecs seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University Responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that are eco-responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Québec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential in stimulating this consumption bread currently lived by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and doubtfulness of information would calm the armour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Furthermore, one-third of the Québec people are also untrusted to the alleged performance of green products or services that they are seeking to be put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed their brand from one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo Consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems however to stay outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, just 28% of Québec’s reported to have used public transport or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and biking have also been supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to financially engage in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only with a loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, who hoped a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard by regaining his full film vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to engage in the file, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million request had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for Cultural Enterprises Development (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to respond until December 31.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the state's donation really needs to be removed.
Let's remember that the Québec Cinema and Cine Park Owners Association opposed a direct investment from the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema halls.
But several stakeholders of the environment, on the contrary, claimed substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of sceans, for ten years brought the author’s cinema in his premises in the complex after funding its construction himself, which could justify an derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize his customers.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push on the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to stream films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th by projecting Xavier Beauvois' very beautiful film of men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini hasn’t recalled The Duty and we don’t know what he and his group think about the downward proposals made to them.
The sailing lifted on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil over what the United States considers to be the Canadians’ lowerness complex towards the Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of the Canadians’ superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter did not have Canadian-American relationships in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative Government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public square yesterday, offer more crushing details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the full federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not among the challenges discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations to this situation.
“A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about internal daily challenges rather than to bring this election to the United States (such as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he wrote.
The United States, he concludes, is therefore “the proverb elephant of this election: all-present, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands the less that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote.”
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business charger in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama to his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the survival of the government during the trust vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will showcase its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion rebound plan,” Breese wrote.
It is not mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that dramatic series broadcast to CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accommodate some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Let’s finally note that the minds are warming about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former very close adviser to Stephen Harper, said on CBC’s waves that the responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered”.
He became the echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a domestic, commercial and industrial lighting renovation plan in 100 countries in order to obtain a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction needed to be made to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet would be light.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
Last year in Copenhagen, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have committed to voluntary reduction plans that should increase overall GSE emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will need to remove this further 5 Gt balance sheet to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees centigrade by 2020 in order to prevent it from going out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostates in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves for fluo-compact bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluo-compact bulb, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits in nervousness the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines were expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without any further delay," said a spokesman for the United Nations Chief.
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to be liable and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral committee allowed to pass the date on Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the CEI president had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied worldwide on Wednesday so that the CIS finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the missing coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Ivory president's campaign director, said the intimidation manoeuvres of the NF voters in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing president's supporters from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are held by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, deemed "inacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he didn't until claim the victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of results because he knows he has lost and that he has filed complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential on Sunday was supposed to crowne the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Bureau of Labour (ITB) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% by counting overseas departments), shows correctional data of provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published by Insee Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the metropolis active population and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More largely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available to work within two weeks and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further decreased, with a further increase in unemployment rate, to 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including OMDs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed under the BIT.
Seniors, in their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 point over three months and over one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has no longer published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy about its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September on Tuesday.
Alexandre Guerini examined and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of President of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was examined and broken at the arrest house in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation on alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been examined for the abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, repel, active corruption, influence trafficking and ammunition detention, his lawyer says.
"Alexander Guerini is a battleman and wants to explain on all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reproachable chiefs, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told the AFP prior to his customer's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has, through his lawyers, pledged to make a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening and broken down.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his customer never did anything but to run the discharges he had to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew it, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Chief Executive Officer of the Aubagne Agglomeration, was examined on Wednesday in order to dismiss public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My customer was able to provide explanations to the facts that are accused of him."
"The instructor judge took it into account by not depriving him of freedom," his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux, said.
Four others had been examined and released on Tuesday night by Wednesday, with placement under judicial supervision for two of them, Deputy Attorney Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy CEO of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined one for "sustraction and diversion of public goods by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "complication of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for “receiving abuse of social property.”
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently broken down in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement to Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies of having used to laundry money from great bandism.
The investigation was conducted as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 as a result of anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
As a source close to the investigation, the investigations focused in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne waste and certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elysee exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the halen opinion in France, put diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Tehran.
All this is under the attentive look of the US diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, giving them advice for treating their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman hadn’t had for counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they placed under a crude light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases."
The Elysee Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own force-retained citizens in Iran.
"Make the noise," they say, "constantly marvel in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after attempts to discuss discrete channels, “silence will resolve nothing,” the Iranians are “masters in dilatory manoeuvres.”
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political chanting.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss’ prison (which will take place on August 16, day when she refuses to the Embassy of France) “will require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money” (230,000 euros of guarantee).
And he makes it known that the Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "goes to get worse."
The Iranians could “in the near future stop another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has left prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is broadcast: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, upon a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioned about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the clandestine Iranian networks of acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a merchant?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, has not only "summer completely surprised by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
“There have been vibrant exchanges between the French presidency and the sealkeeping” (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot return to the judicial decision,” he said.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "narrow" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysean adviser makes up a phone number, hit and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysee does not stop its efforts, by means of media-organised communications and "fuiting" to believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears its fruit since several press articles repeat the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On which is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
“Despite their statements of praise, French officials recognize privately that they have only a wave of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that forced Elysée to put in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unworthy."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate what praises it can attract to Syria by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier said, “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them yet."
“This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriots."
No online games for young Koreans spent midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, representatives of Culture and Family Ministries said.
"A lot of children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, ministerial officer in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Societies will have a year to prepare for enforcement of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are asking for, the official added.
It’s also going to make it available to people who call for free software that limits time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the uncontested champion of world online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, faced with 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
In full torment due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints Thursday countries organizing World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk to take step on technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the Queen FIFA competition will take place in Europe, traditional discipline bastion (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Belgium).
This 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities as part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar Emir, Belgian and Dutch heads, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political issues of a World Cup.
The scenes may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football cradle that only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC broadcast a documentary that picks up three influential CE members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dissatisfie the FIFA and put in embarrassment the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying with David Cameron in the first line in recent weeks.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the JO-2012 organization for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to round England's blason to the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the Spanish-Portugal duo doesn’t lack any benefits with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of both countries could doubt their ambitions.
Possible retaliations against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the Russian rating, becoming an outsider of weight despite the lack of its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a barely hidden mention of the English press accusations against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we're trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears to be the logic favorites.
First global economic power, headquarters of the FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to have an advance over Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which was desired by the FIFA, would actually make Asian chances declined by 2022.
With Qatar, which launched the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue its expansion towards new countries, but these two countries have more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him feel he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than them.
One mandate to Elysee calls another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the obvious doesn’t clean well with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to do as if doubt still exists.
In one way as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "some part in the fall of 2011."
That he speaks before UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at Elysee, the prospect of "two mandates" thus sowed a bit of febrility.
Was this the official announcement of his application?
We were far from it.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited to two the number of five-years.
He made a conclusion, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he speaks of the presidential, on the tone of humor, during such meetings.
"In the worst, or at best, you still have it for seven and a half years with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the step below."
His speech of yesterday does not make him more candidate than the previous day; they do not make him less.
If they have comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's entry into the clip that forces Nicolas Sarkozy to unveil.
On the contrary, because his 2012 candidate is obvious that many of the PS call for an earlier battle order than expected.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidate to Nicolas Sarkozy’s candidate (46% compared to 44%), according to BVA-L’Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's environment immediately and cautiously responded.
“If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always believe he'll be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, obviously assigned.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to specify the arrangements for crisis exit or, at least, to announce the termination of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the sovereign European debt requires, the Frankfurt emissions institute will probably not be able to allow itself to be so retardant under the penalty of aggravating a situation more than today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, on a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the debt crisis of the States in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
“I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...).”
The European Parliament's Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs, President Jean-Claude Trichet, on the hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels on the day before, didn't say more about his intentions, just indicating that the programme for the purchase of state securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "wea we will see what we decide at the meeting."
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main steering rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s Treasury bond purchases doubled last week, at nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, she would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the eurosystem’s central banks have purchased for EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, anticipations for purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists are also not expecting a significant shift in progress.
While loan operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB continues to make unlimited cash allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that it changes its program significantly."
"If not, it would be risking new short-term tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its public debt market interventions, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to encourage an attractive market,” Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to sovereign debt markets in the eurozone, the emissions institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“He must at any cost replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states,” a major bond manager said yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly, the states will be the more disturbed to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi rounds the back
After a worrying early week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the bond rate reflux at 10 years old.
A return to precarious calm.
Upon a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the region's presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation as "undecryptable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which then denied.
On Tuesday, the gap with German long rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CDS) had flyed at 263 points, resulting in a certain decline in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was above 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared "heavily concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax returns that goes with, causing the risk to the State of no longer being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the Senate budget is being reviewed on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the rumors of a new budgetary collective that could be set up after the celebrations, for a amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will need to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the present time, Italy receives support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the Italian International Monetary Fund in charge of the IMF.
“There is no problem immediately, neither short nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are lower than those requested by other countries,” says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship to the House of Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parlia
It would then open a period which is unfavorable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde said, “The Europeans, I believe, we have still demonstrated it on Sunday and at night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone.”
Although any relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot talk about a start of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems,” says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because “the political time is much slower than the time of markets.”
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers it has, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more widely, with their G20 peers go well.
This is also the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
At the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the markets collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the ground for them.
The first FESF securities emissions are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the U.S. would support a potential increase in funds mobilised by additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to the closer-effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a path different from Greece and Ireland.
Each of the two would like to avoid applying for international assistance before implementing their own budgetary fixes and decide on the structural reforms that are essential to restore sustainable confidence.
European donors finally talk about the options available to accelerate the standardization process of sovereign bond markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to handle the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading European sovereign debt market actor, believe that a length of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of cash.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which has been equipped with 60 billion euros to date.
A council that has all the chance of being carefully considered in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were worse.
Snow and glass: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still create traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and glaze.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, supported snowfalls affect north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, at a time of 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow episodes are sufficiently noticeable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Meteo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited for heavy carriers of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarms who recommend to take its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy carriers.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to be most cautious on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Directorate-General (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
In Britain, the airport of Gatwick, south of London, and the airport of Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Skies
Since the time the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France beats its full, the billions rain.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris subway that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical pattern, this sum will then allow the SGP to borrow a share of the funding of its double loop on the markets.
Today we finally reach the first additions.
The 2010 Financial Amendment Act, discussed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the plans to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increased tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the bill, article 15, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is €117 million per year."
The second is a redesign of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from the four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the state and brought to the Society du Grand Paris as the project," the reasons read.
In the SGP, this system is not shocking.
"From the time you create revenues (both taxes, ndlr), you can cover three-year studies and then tap in the four billion later, we explain it."
“This will be included in the budget and drawn as far as possible.”
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, is likely to cause a slightly agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revengers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in front of the hypocrisy that governs the relationships between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
Let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirming that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what could be read for months in any newspaper (except those of whom Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi’s sinisterly caricatural profile has long been for sketch-matter cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unrelevant research (or knows where to look for news about the inexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe that they already know, and who reaffirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for secret records.
The informationer is lazy, and lazy (or with limited mind) the head of secret services (otherwise he might be, I know, editor in Liberation), who only retains as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of states can phone or plan to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representative exercises, have become spionage centres.
Any spectator of survey movies knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one seems to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy under poor light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secrets of the world’s most powerful country leads to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put victims in crisis as well as the "bowls".
But let’s come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in the time of Orwell, we could conceive all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwellian prophecy was completely proven since, able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a venger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is a empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that everything about Berlusconi's character or Merkel is actually a empty secret, because it is under the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks made, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to publish any reserved information online - this would return to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserve reports be maintained in the future?
I know well that for the moment my forecast is science-fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to the uncontrollable routes, being only carriers of messages learned by heart or, at least, hiding the rare information written in the heel.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key-closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate attempt to spy has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now going on in crab, that is to say backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrapher revolutionised communications, the Internet restored a wire (telephone) telegraph.
The videocassettes (analogicals) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a movie step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allowed to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that communications policy and techniques return to horseback cars.
A last observation.
Previously, the press was trying to understand what was doing in the secret of embassies.
Now, the embassies are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: How France Budgets Its Promises of Financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider compliance with the promises of rapidly unlocked funding (that is fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the large French bituillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million a year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners from the reality of its commitment to fast-start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, brochures distribution...
Transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right path to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional effort is made without being at the expense of the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what “new and additional” means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believes that funding for “all new projects” of 2010 is “new and additional”.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditures of previous years or at the overall level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to comply with its commitment to “new and additional” funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that €1 borrowed equal to €1 given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to emission mitigation based on more effective technologies), it is necessary to present an euro that will be recovered as equivalent to an euro that is given... At least, it should not be counted under its commitments than the cost of the loan for the lender country (the equivalent country).
But France has only done such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check itself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice password tour!
In summary, in its fast-start financing, France operates double fraud: on the one hand on the evolution of action in time and on the other hand on the reality of financial effort.
Only spending 36.1 million euros, it is able to make it believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in consistency with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other member states continue to give if enough to loan?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely dup...
The early funding chapter is only a small, relative short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be another sand grain in the immense machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn the lessons from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its commitments and equity with other countries in the European Union.
But above all, France could advance the discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter discussed today): we will not escape the issue of "additionality" or the way to account for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these challenges as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would be likely to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in discussions.
Alert for pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child intakes 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (formerly Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns its results “have no significant statistical value in the light number of analysed samples, but are illustrative of the issue treated,” bought the foods generally consumed in four meals and one in one day by a child of a decade in the Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September.
These types of meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily daily dai
81 chemical substances, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancer-like substances and five classified cancer-like substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptor (PE), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical taken are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially cancer pollutants and/or PE is concerning," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three proven as some cancer residues as well as nearly twenty residues that might disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as an encas by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same thing is true for Kenya’s green beans, including lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, hacked steak, boxed tuna, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were trumped with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the rope the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate plate used to heat the microwave meal was not free of it.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminants cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its part, proposed "face to the emergency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study from the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
