Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly proposed to amend their title in “MWP” (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
This is the reason for plans to change the name of the National Assembly in “Welsh Parliament” (Wales).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name “reimms with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For non-Wales readers: In Wales, "twp" is "doof" and "pwp" is "Aa".
A national meeting member of the party Plaid Cymru said the entire group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which currently draws up a law for the changes to the name, said: “The final decision on the names for the members of the National Assembly is of course by members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that broadly supported the name “Welsh Parliament” for the National Assembly.
As regards the title of the National Assembly members, the “Welsh Parliament Members” or “WMPs” group preferred, while the “MWP” option was most supported at a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seemingly suggest alternative options, however, the ring about a consensus for Chairman Elin Jones, which is intended to submit a bill within weeks, could constitute a problem.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members of the National Assembly and for the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name during their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country’s name
The voters decide on Sunday whether their country’s name will be changed to “North Macedonia”.
The referendum was proposed to address a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been suggesting that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raising the Greek territory, and has repeatedly expressed itself against its entry into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of the name, said he will not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke with said that in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no longer both today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social life looks different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly meet.”
In the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will "be at the beginning before or later."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments in which people live who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white and to accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who enter these housing will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist community extracted in the 1930s.
A black community that held their worships nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott by retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but as the father of Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bell of the poor."
The expert who shouted the bell game in July used other words: “A cultural wealth” and “an unreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was switched to the biggest bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What happened in St. Martin’s last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been added partly by the church’s lay leaders and partly by the Bishops’ Diocese.
In July, the Board of the Commonwealth – the Board of the Commonwealth’s leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would attempt to pass the costs to the Board of the Commonwealth, although he had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors entrusted by the diocese.
Some community members complained about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old in California when diving for lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV channel in San Diego, he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning for about a half an hour when he heard the boy’s cry of help and with several others padded to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to capture a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key leg was cracked up.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flyed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical condition.
The type of hair responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had come to the conclusion that it was not a dangerous hairstyle.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
For investigative purposes and for safety reasons, officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but mostly they are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to lead cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s attacks with a lovely cosmetic department of stores, occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale boost to the UK’s 2.8 billion UK pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and household revenues fall, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven stores will be tested across the country, and if they prove to be successful, they will expand to further stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is combined with the search for supermarkets for opportunities to use otherwise store areas used previously for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering is doubled to up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
Furthermore, the supermarket takes a relaunch of its “Boutique” makeup series, making the majority of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Furthermore, the fragrance shop is tested at two Sainsbury's sales sites. The first sales site was opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second one is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local need items stores means that supermarkets need to do more to arrange customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, sales sites are increasingly looking like stores, as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food articles tries to fight against the Discounter Aldi and Lidl.
Since the purchase of Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has established hundreds of Argos stores and a number of habitat stores, which has increased food revenues and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's joint venture tested in the early 2000s with boats, but ended after a discussion on the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's offices in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company announced that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as it added an expanded range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping.”
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughbys withdrawal from a business worth 11 million UK pounds
“Dragons” star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million UK pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby annoyed “Dragons’ The” star Peter Jones with its extremely short-term withdrawal from its lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been “furious” when the “Golden Girl” of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, has been admitted to, due to its new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessory brand Truly cannot get enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of 11 million UK pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced his withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, “Truly for Holly was the highest priority at a distance.
It should secure for them their future over the next few decades in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods awaits to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of Britain’s most promising stars, could cost millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and further delays in the launch of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friendly with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as chairman in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of I'm A Celebrity.
A Jones nearby source said last night, “We don’t comment on his business issues.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He shamed the criticism he had from the news media for a comment that some would consider as “non-presidential” and expected for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitated the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as Trump’s first meeting in Singapore in June was praised as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have fallen into stock.
Over three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “equivalent” US reaction to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the U.S. held sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump showed himself much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages, and returning the mortal remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to enter this overwhelmed arena, about 200 people would stand here,” Trump said, showing the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After Lombok’s earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been distributed, no national emergency state has been declared, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made very clear that they do not request international support, so that’s a little difficult,” Sumbang said.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure if foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Catastrophe Protection Authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as a result of whether international jobs should be involved in the aid measures.
In view of the global tremors with which Indonesia is constantly struggling, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural violences.
While in Aceh tsunami protection accommodations were built, these are not a daily view on other coastal strips.
The obvious lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning entered into force, has likely contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between many islands of Indonesia is already a challenge in the optimum case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for treating earthquake victims is on the road to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at least in three days.
President Joko Widododo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the core of its election campaign and spent plenty of funds for roads and railways.
However, the Government of the Joko next year aims to re-election suffers from financing deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to continued confession tensions in Indonesia, and members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and apartments when gangs of Christians and Muslims were fighting on the streets with machets, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge wins deep compensation strips against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 back from his team at about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed highly over the criminal space and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball dropped over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I’ve just tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw the edge coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led the Belgian star Eden Hazard at 1:0 after a hit in the 25th minute.
The blues striker returned a pass with his heel to Mateo, then turned near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steel pass so that Hazard came into the criminal space.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left shot to Liverpool’s Alisson Becker behind the network.
Liverpool plays at the Champions League group phase on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will be in front of the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to the catastrophe agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be captured in the ruins of buildings that had been brought into crash by the earthquake of the 7.5 strength from Friday, up to six meters high waves, authority spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was seated with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests a man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
Following the find of a women's liquor this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with injuries in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police call on the residents to sign up if they have seen or heard anything.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said, “The investigation is in an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers who may have somewhat taken up with a Dashcam, to contact us; they may have information that is of great importance for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and found in a building.
Today’s afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived at the crime site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigations were running, and the police reported that they were in informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to enter his apartment but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was unspeaked when he heard what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now treated as a crime location.
A woman appeared dissolved in tears at the place of happening.
She repeatedly repeatedly, “this is so terrible.”
At 14:00 a.m. two police vehicles were within the closure and another vehicle before the closure.
Within the closure were several police officers who monitored the residential block.
Persons with information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and refer to the Sept. 30 Protocol No. 247.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament is the latest monument of the dispute about rewriting history
Their imprisonment would be poetic justice for his reminder of the Taliban destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Cricks’ proposal as “fool” and “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate on removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue became the target in front of Westminster’s Palace.
The picture storm during the English Civil Wars was neither arranged nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century ruling opinion and part of the storytelling of a figure, which many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, than someone who defended the parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether it is an entirely accurate representation, it is the subject of continued historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing a side of this gap.
His accomplishments as a Lord protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them.”
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed in a market in the southwest of China by a pig.
The man only called the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a cross-separated artery overflow near a pig stall on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is willing to inject pig vaccines in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he was traveling with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stall was open.
He said in the stall, a big male pig with blood found on the snauce.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram heavy pig had dead to the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and stubborn,” the cousin, whose surname was called ‘Wu’, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Pictures of a safety camera showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News that the pig has been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime site.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating reports of a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts and the husband suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram heavy pig clamped a Wales farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could spend the animal.
After a farmer was eaten in Oregon in 2012 by his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can appear as a "driver".
“You are just played.
They like to get out and are very curious... they are not out of hurting someone.
You only have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
The remnants of hurricane rose bring widespread strong rain to the southwest of the United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakened on the way over colder water on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floods in the coming days in Northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, at 5:00 p.m. East coast time, pink wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane, and located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reached the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday up to 25 centimeters.
Then, the tropical moisture in the coming days generates strong rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the throat.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous floating floods, water driving debris, and possibly earth floods in the desert.
High tropical moisture leads to rains of almost 5 to 7.5 inches per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, rainfall is expected up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the dispersion of the tropical precipitation, the possibility of floating floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical precipitation, it is urgently unsuggested to walk to the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to canyons rioting streams, and thunderstorms bring locally wind and wind that leads dust.
The nearby trog brings strong local rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total lower rate amounts of over a centimeter can be possible, which can lead to small water-driving waste and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall season in this region.
The first united tropical rainshowers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and it rains on Monday and Tuesday evening.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and holds over Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic is cooling, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continued summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm October start with widespread temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the north-east.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is approximately 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of above-average temperatures in the first October half in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
Over 20 million viewers on Thursday at six television networks saw the striking statements of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the television stations stopped their regular program on Friday because of a last minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate’s judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, pushed her down and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement he was 100% sure that this didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring spectators in offices.
To turn this into the right perspective: this is about the number of viewers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaugh, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the day-to-day audience.
ABC came to second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters urged him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood with a lower sight for a few minutes while he was shot. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he tells the country the truth?”
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” a woman said.
Flake said his office published a statement and supplemented before the elevator concluded he would have to say more at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later, when the judicial committee should vote for the entire Senate for the re-nomination of Kavanaughs.
Flake said, however, that he would only do this on the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, calls for investigating the accusations against the candidate next week.
Flake was partially convinced by talking to a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance because it was obvious that without the investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh's confirmation.
President Trump has triggered an FBI investigation of accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the nation's interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a other interview published on the newspaper’s title page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit, providing a proposal that considers the mutual induction of tariffs by Britain and the EU as “totally absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player’s death
The police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authority released video recordings of the fight between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the crime location and said that DNA was found on Simpson's glasses.
After Simpson's survey, the police said he had stood on Wayde's deadly shots.
The advocate reports that the deposit was set to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office published a provisional report on Friday that the cause of the death was a shot wound on the neck.
The police thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the leading investigation to arrest.
LSU’s sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre wings player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had played for the LSU basketball.
Last season, he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shocked” about Wayde’s death and “being in shock.”
“You’re always afraid of such a thing,” Wade said.
Volcano spit ashes in Mexico City.
Ash expelled from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater has increased and 183 outbreaks of gas and ashes were registered within 24 hours.
The authority monitored numerous cases of cracks and vibrations.
Pictures on social media showed thin ashes layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, geophysicists found an earthquake of 7.1 strength in Central Mexico, increasing activity at the volcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence demonstrators, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were retained by the police forced them with eggs and also threw colour powders, so dark dust clouds emerged in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the next day, it also came to hands with the police who used their blows to remove the struggles.
For several hours, pro-independence groups “no forget, no forgiveness,” while they faced Unionists who called “long living Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated due to smaller injuries in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, however, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the vote participation was low, as the disruption opponents largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police attempted to prevent the vote in violent clashes before the election sites.
Pro-independence groups had struggled outdoors on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the Separatists protest, said he sees the prospects that Catalonia would achieve independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we have experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they were able to vote, but now we are hanging fast,” he said.
In spite of a major, even short, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties this year to maintain the vibration. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in the self-imposed exile or in detention, where they are waiting for their proceedings due to their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest for police on his phone, said that the conflict has been driven by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly stressed,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European election, the best way to deal with the decrease of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government is," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car house was burned
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been burned several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself were damaged.
Besides, it may have been shot on the car with a brass.
Menga match means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The upward Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox association.
Dolly Menga’s hits proved to be crucial for Gary Holt’s team to be equal to Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without away win and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which will be eight points back.
Rangers will be hosted by Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the Division to six games, that is, chief trainer Holt has not yet defeated since his overcoming Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team had to have been in leadership for a long time before the hit, as his directity put the Rangers in front of the most diverse problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but became slower in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he was sighting in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play before themselves because they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way came the decisive gate.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance that Declan Gallagher and Robinson brought Menga together in the shooting position. He shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the criminal space.
During this phase, the Rangers had dominated ball possession, but could not overcome the hosts’ defense, and gate guards Liam Kelly remained largely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was defeated by the Rangers guardian Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slipped the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered the Livingston Criminal Area and were regularly brought out of the danger area, while two required criminal offences – one by Halkett against the interchangeed Glenn Middleton and one for handplay – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her playing way and her team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has shaken the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As long as they were under Gerrard, they couldn’t reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the rangers located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) smiling faces and blue skys reigned when the heads of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day by President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relationships between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and accession to the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police called safety reasons for preventing a 25,000 people’s crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard themselves. They condemned Erdogan’s politics as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and dismissed by others as a autocrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in London in a struggle with a car.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a rich traffic road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped, and the healthcare provider cared for the man, however, who died at the accident location.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with driver refuge in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Road locks and redirects for buses have been set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Disturbance
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men.
The trouble broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. of British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stopped.
Specialized “Tornado” officials have been added to end the trouble involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site for smaller injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prison Service said: “It has been specially trained prison personnel used to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that the responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly will spend longer time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin, there are more than 500 criminal prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison leader was reported to be treated by a criminal prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, employees were called to prison to address serious disturbances in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding-like floods (dry areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but exactly this is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa draw over the southwest marked by deserts and bring the risk of floating floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floating floods on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, and south east of California and Utah including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cycles have come close to 320 kilometers as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible in a total of up to 10 centimeters.
For those with no risk of floating floods, the rainfall associated with rose can be a blessing due to drought in the region.
Although floods are seriously concerned, this rain will probably be somewhat useful because there is now drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," the weather.com reported.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with a maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour, located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit cold water and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can fall strongly in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant flooding risk.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfall sums are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," the weather.com reported.
Then, Rosa will draw as a tropical storm in northern direction over Mexico, reaching the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then draw through Arizona up to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday night.
“As a major danger, it is expected to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the north-west of the Sonora desert and the US south-west deserts,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these rainfalls, floating floods and driving floods are expected in the desert as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stabil".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old was arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all who have records of the events on a mobile phone to sign up.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the anger, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the uncrupulous and unheard tactics of Democrats,” Trump said in a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “under the anger” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh announced Thursday before Congress and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also announced her accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh’s brightness, quality and courage on that day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance sheet in the service of the public,” he said in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our life.
“I don’t stick, but in reality I stick,” he said.
“I fight everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats would see their mission to "compete and block resistance."
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday in the Senate, a senior employee of the GOP leadership said to CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, numbers of victims rise
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, and many of them were sweamed out as a huge earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit giant waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered together on Friday at a festivity on the beach of the city of Palu, when in the dawn of the darkness, waves up to six meters tall beaches beat the beach, while many people destroyed and destroyed everything that was on their way.
An earthquake of strength 7.5 had gone before the tsunami.
“As the threat of the tsunami came yesterday, people still went on the beach and didn’t run off immediately, and they were victimized to him,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he flowed cars, trees, and houses with him, he met everything on land,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people are climbed on trees on the escape of the tsunami and have survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Catastrophe Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shocked by further aftershadows.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday’s massive earthquake has dealt with the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have fallen down.
According to his report, the bodies of some victims were found under the destroyed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to the words of Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was many times criticized for not having informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves came at the time of the warning, according to official information.
Amateur shots published on social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street below him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall cracks to the shore and flows buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately check the authenticity of the recordings.
Due to the earthquake and the tsunami, there was a massive electricity failure that interrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and is reopened only for aid measures.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have securely reached the city of Palu, where employees are accommodated in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but Doseba’s words said passed through scenes of destruction.
“They said they saw numerous destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups with the hard task began to start the disaster aid, some moneted that foreign experts would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible until the place of disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened until now.
“This is a catastrophe at the province level at the moment,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'okay, that's a national disaster, we can accept international support, but this status does not apply until now."
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday dropped over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that brighten the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was drawn from a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been clothed next to her mother's corpse for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the early month’s end of Asian games in Indonesia.
Others were prisoners at the Roa-Roa hotel, such as Mandagi supplements, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel crash under the paragliders rounded, desperately, WhatsApp messages had been sent to the Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, led to grey signs instead of blue checks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling a money machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Thieves, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 when filling a money machine.
The driver had empty a money machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to pay more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money designed for the machine.
According to the press release, several suspects saw escape from the crime, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
People who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known being as Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the name Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change predicts his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the shipment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” West said this year in a talk about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m we, it’s we.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘ye’ – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was announced under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which the West had previously worked together, has also written his name with and without binding strips and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never apply military violence against civilians while the 50th anniversary of bloody repressives against students in his country approached.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, “never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, soldiers had fired to a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, and at that time left-oriented student movements were working to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly aid to students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities led to criminal bands to young people.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increasing activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its expenditure for research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who was active at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on AI announcements of various areas of the U.S. government, even if the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: The country is planning to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubled financial funding could double the chance that the next major AI success would be achieved in the United States, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player and later served as leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Department in China.
Lee commended former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee’s words, researchers in the U.S. often need to work hard to obtain state grants.
"Not China takes away the academic senior forces, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired coryphees from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lees, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also encourage the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think that in the field of AI promoted people should automatically be offered greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its next-generation AI technology development plan (Next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to award funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to be involved in partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. laws have not done anything about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changes to the country’s name
The population of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country’s name is to be changed into “North Macedonia,” which would join a decades old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s applications to enter the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this right raises the Greek territory, therefore Greece has placed a veto against Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign does not doubt that the election participation reachs the 50% required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote list was, “Are you membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries arising from the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth the price to participate in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voting outcome is not legally binding, sufficiently many members of Parliament have said that they would comply with the outcome to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The electoral committee said there were no reports on irregularities until 13.00 a.m.
However, the vote participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I’m here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, on September 30, 2018, will resign their voice in the referendum on the change of the country name that would open Macedonia’s way to accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and introduced seats in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we'd like to join the top, not through the rear entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in highly needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe it will be a large majority for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
According to his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required election participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV determined that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with “yes”.
In order to succeed the referendum, the election participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious strike to the politics of the prowest government since its overtake of power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manufactured through the entire Brighton defense to achieve gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's defense at Manchester City's 2:0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green suits.
He played around one defender and then survived several other defenders on the edge of Brighton’s criminal space.
He then shot a passport left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the criminal room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overturned Mathew Ryan with his right Brighton shoe and shot to the right side of the network.
“Aguero fights with problems in his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We had talked about he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's happened.
We were lucky that he had a gate at this moment.”
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good step along the left flange to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before he slipped into the ball.
City plays in the Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim vs. Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the nationals were out of the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another action.
However, the always powerful joker hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies who have a game forward in the NL West from the Los Angeles Dodgers for the playoffs.
The Rockies won at least one wildcard on Friday evening with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Even though we play for nothing, we can at least throw out because we know the atmosphere with the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday but are inclined, according to reports, to throw jokers in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th player as a starter, worked on Thursday in the bull and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington lawyer has this season's statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops rallying in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the board Kavanaugh chosen by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“All that we have done is on the match in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our life.
“This is one of the big, big – I don’t go, but in reality I go, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again with all the means, you see the unity, the abomination.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we will not give them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission to “compete against and block.”
“And you’re seeing this in the last four days,” he said and called the Democrats “angry, and common, and abhorable, and unhonourable.”
He namely called the highest rank Democratic in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered the audience's loud buffles.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Oh, uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for a -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour doesn’t let all opinions apply anymore.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this was little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour members who are told that they are not welcome – only because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had risen strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the counterfeit request that I represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironicly on similar topics that Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said “the meetings should be all involved and productive.”
The GC meetings of Friday evening in my eight years as local Labour Deputy were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most sessions are not marked by this tone, and the promised "friendlier, more careful" policy has been forgotten for a long time when it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party’s top.
This began shortly after Jeremy’s party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a reversing application and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it’s regarding national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – notwithstanding what I say – follows a blasphemous death in the social media that calls for my election, the political center complains and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face each day a flood of sexistic or racist blasphemy but never join small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that blasphemy has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called for Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance last week.
In reality, we no longer let all opinions apply, and with every mistrust request and any change in the rules of election, the party becomes closer.
I have often been advised in the last two years to draw my head and not express my opinion so clearly, then I wouldn’t have any problems.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I’ve joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, led by the negligence of the Thatcher government, due to which my classroom in the overall school literally disrupted, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a municipal council as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hell from my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To supporters of Friday’s application, I just want to say the following: Given the fact that the country is going to hurt a Brexit, that households, businesses and our public service will harm, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not send this a message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not they are Labour members: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many voting threats or political thoughts will not prevent me from acting in my opinion of the best interest of you all.
Chris Leslie is Deputy for Nottingham East
Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely fun game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to its superior defence as well as their better opportunity recycling, and coach Peter Murchie had all the reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games until now, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said, “Acknowledgement for Ayr, they have used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr in leadership, however, Melrose was able to speak the numbers because of a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a not-increased attempt.
Climo built Ayr’s leadership with a punishment before hitting a hit directly in the half-time and then hitting an increased attempt in the single, so that it standed at the break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose began the second half, however, well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then a longer interruption occurred due to a severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the playground. Following the continuation, Ayr built his advantage by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowall by Climo.
Then, the captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose left enormous pressure to pay the extra man through an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved a touchdown behind the forward Ayr package.
Climo increased, like almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxkick had stopped and flange player Gregor Henry released for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a switch into the hospitality industry after it turned out he was called a managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays one of the main roles in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglong.
According to official entries, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan is interested in entering Glasgow’s “flowing restaurant business”.
“The Sea belongs to us”: Bolivia enclosed by land hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in front of the navy headquarters adorned with dumplings in La Paz.
In public buildings, a sea blue flag flows.
Float bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Regain it is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, including the country, is the memory of the coastal section lost from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century as much as the desire to ride over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice, which will be taken on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the vibration, a spirit of unity and serenity and awaits the result, of course, with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will pursue the IGH’s judgment on large screens, in hope that the court in Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand, according to which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is committed to negotiate about a sovereign access to Bolivia’s sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who will have a controversial struggle for his reelection next year, is also much at stake in the judgment on Monday.
“We are just ahead of returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that it would change little.
The UN institution based in the Netherlands is unauthorized to approve Chilean territory, and has decided that it will not decide on the result of possible talks.
According to Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law, that the IGH’s judgment has been held for six months after the conclusion of the IGH, the case was “not complicated”.
Far away from supporting the Bolivia case, the last four years could also mean a return.
“The current Bolivian government has brought the issue of access to the sea to itself,” Zarate said.
She suggested that Morales' warrior rhetoric has blown up all Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these happenings this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia “has an exceptional opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139 years of disputes for mutual advantage.”
Calzadilla also denies that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political bridge.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
“Judgment is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arrange its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made in actions during a summit between the heads of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to stand shortly before the North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore to return the arrested nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and the US resistance to a statement to end the Korean war would ever force the North into the knees as "heart-spinned".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang initially taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepsis that Pyongyang is seriously meant to refrain from an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang for the next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look for anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized head covers for their summer collection 2019 that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their insightful creations over the running track.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that straightened the heads of the models.
Other overdimensional accessories were shown as watermelons occupied with jewelry, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were provided with sealed lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted egg.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 inches wide edge, all of which are carried from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat that hit large waves in the social media sent another great creation over the running track: a beach pocket of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the pocket.
The bast pocket in red orange with bast franses and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus’ summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach pockets will be available for the next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has excited so much look that the demand for overdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued with further outstanding examination results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to care for their students and parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as election courses.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak with someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s current examination results find that languages with the highest rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who learned foreign languages achieved the note A in the higher tests.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of Mandarin students scored the Note A during higher exams, while 72 percent of students learning German scored the Note A, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored the Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are today considered as electoral subjects as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers called for the problems of occupating open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the elected profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give a lead from competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to carry out a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language lessons now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be teached that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are, independent schools will always be selected a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this point, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain essential to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication ability.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We need to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James arrives for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will soon end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48"," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
Early this week, James was asked after training according to his plans for the Lakers’ six-game seasonal pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign campaigns.
This is the first of Trump’s five campaigns planned for the next week, among other things in well-known places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on confirming his vacation election at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the coming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are running at risk of losing control over the Congress.
When will Trump’s competition take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s performance in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 p.m.
You can track Trump's performance in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably appeal to the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court to accuse sexual misconduct that was conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the slowness up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to face a difficult election in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five campaigns serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters next week while the Republicans try to preserve and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important for his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible while the operating campaign season approaches,” a Trump spokesman, who did not want to call his name, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, “Ohio and Pennsylvania can participate and report media from Pittsburgh,” the Wesbanco Arena planned for tonight in Wheeling.
Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“There is no good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him drive in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows battle readiness to maintain hope for individuals on Sunday
After three single-sided rounds, the four parties could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The vibrant pending of the momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum in your opinion now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that’s a little momentum for us,” said Spieth.
Europe is of course at the advantage and lies four points in front, while twelve more follow.
According to Spieth, however, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was unbelievably strong from the outbreak to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams were louder in the course of his round when he sinked an important putt to choose the fourth match with four points for themselves after he and Thomas had returned after two holes with two points.
His putt, who chose the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to get in and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players who scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and thus doubtless wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unlikely but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and cannot do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who didn’t hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and with the nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and seemingly flowing energy between them and the outdated amount underlines that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But speaking of European glory would have been early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning, who played together with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Sweden into a clip that they couldn’t overcome nearly.
On Sunday, no one can help them out of the cloak.
The Four and Four couples are so fascinating to look from nearby due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in leadership on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe leads on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four- and four-parts of Saturday, Europe stands forward to the United States at 10:6 and goes with a solid advance in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The cool-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories over the Tiger Woods fighting with difficulty and thus able to account for four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fourth in the morning compared to the faulty-playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States gave more resistance and won two matches, but could not retrieve the residue.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newborn to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", only won four points as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they excellently harmonized and beat the unraveled Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more pressing 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally lighted his gloss, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in Vierers and Vierers and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the Four in the morning, returned and played the Four parties as Henrik Stenson’s partner. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measurement sheet for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They gained a 2&1 victory in the fours over the playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four parts 4&3 after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a residue of four points. However, as a title holder, Fury’s team is sufficient to keep the trophy.
After only standing in second place for two days, it doesn’t seem like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea took substantial measures last year from “good will.” For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, destroyed the nuclear test areas and committed itself to not multiplying nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We don't see the U.S.'s corresponding reaction," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never be one-sided first."
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase” approach in the denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significantly when it had done a single-sided denuclearization in the past, as it had rejected in the first place.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had assured to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korea war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Furthermore, Washington opposes demands for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insist on ‘first denuclearization’ and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and are even against the ‘explication of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brainspiring of those who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not enter into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, highlighted by the U.S. head of state in the early week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister said to three meetings between Kim and South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If South Korea would be the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the United States, it would not have stopped the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the sound of Ris’s speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. continent after the “evil president” Trump Kim called a “missile man” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “complete destruction” last year, overwhelmed Kim with bravery in the United Nations for disarmament steps, however, he said that there is still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said on Thursday to the UN Security Council, “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must definitely be continued vigorously until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea to financially dry down Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said at the departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made to be accused only for hours later by North Korea that he made "gangs-like claims".
North Korea agreed this month to decrease a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States has taken “equivalent measures”.
He said Kim told him that the intended “equivalent measures” are security guarantees that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalizing relationships with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in basic study this year. This is a measure against the spreading machoculture, keeping up with caffeine and learning all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to take the course into life after having held a lecture on the effects of sleep removal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know about it until now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one has ever told her how important sleep is, and that surprised me."
This year’s first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improved general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Chief Executive Officer of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after found that students suffered from severe sleep retreat during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see the picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information on the effect of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep lack on sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep removal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged by using a map of the university site with interactive symbols to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just how you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” said Professor Czeisler.
The pride on pushing a "night layer" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep should be ensured that the “secret weapons” of all students should be against stress, exhaustion, and fear. Also, weight gain could be avoided as sleep removal leaves the brain into the hunger mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push to a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before taking their studies at the competitively oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that comes out of electronic screens and LED lights and can bring circadian rhythm out of the tact. This leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor beats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unconsequently playing team meant a 0:1 lower position at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first outside victory since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard to the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team remained eight points behind the Ladbroke's Premiership with a distance leading Hearts.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the poor inspiring Rangers seemed to have no chance to balance.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies only behind Hibernian with the tortoise difference.
The Rangers also threatened further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated by an object thrown out of the guest block due to a headache.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overlaped Ayr and reached the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the contrary, Holt remained with the same 11 Livingston players who dropped the Hearts a point last week, and should be excited as his well-trained team kept his opponent under pressure step-by-step.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to achieve a gate after only two minutes when Menga’s first tax led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Gate, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game appeared rather hopeful in the last third than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos obviously believed that after a quarter hour he should have been punished due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not let the Colombian complaints apply.
The Rangers arrived in the first half-time only two gateway shots, but former Ibrox gateway guard Liam Kelly had hardly difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a stem shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s hits in the 34th minute may not match the game course, it is not to deny that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple degree.
Gerrard acted in the middle of the time and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the wings player Morelos placed, but the impressive Kelly rolled up from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to lead the guests to play exactly the game they played, with Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and stopped Jacobs before Lithgow's headball from the corner.
Rangers' exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a punishment late after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from our Sunday Morning-Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Geiger counter, who has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is this worldwide?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “That’s true, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63st birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" detarted cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy detarted cells.
In the course of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to detect detarted cells.
In the method, a patient is taken from immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a many types of cancer common protein and then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman’s ovarian cancer treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize detarted cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can "see" the many cancer types of common protein HER2, and then reinjected cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestinal cancer, as Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken from immune cells and taught them to attack cancer cells has helped in treating a leukemia type.
Kanye West left a Pro-Trump Tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was released at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widespreadly praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town”, while wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he continued with a mob against the Democrats and emphasised once again his support for Trump.
“I’m asked so often by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago,” he said.
SNL began the shipment with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a fun to Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s judicial committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West’s murder had not been sent, it was uploaded to social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to be fun with the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage for his head coating.
“They’ve spoiled me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You whispered me!
And then they say I’ll find myself in a drowned area,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the downside area?" He said, "He will dress my supermancape, because that means that you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go forward with the world?
Try it with love.”
His comments triggered at least twice from the audience, and SNL participants appeared embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, "It was still dead in the studio."
West was committed late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture called “I Love It”, where he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, and tweeted: “At one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you, THAT HAST YOU THAT OF THE MASSE.”
But talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, becomes a harmful ideology for my community and gives itself (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Prior to the mission, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he changed his name and now was “The being formally known as Kanye West” (the officially known beings as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name, and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased musical legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Accusations for attempted murder in Belfaster Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man with a knife was injured on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred, according to police in Ballyhackamore.
The accused will appear before the arbitration court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are checked by the prosecutor’s office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO’s medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would lead to that boys often feel strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something was wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who also participated in “Game of Thrones”, admitted that the problem was “very important” for him.
“I personally find the question very important at the moment, what has gone wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men in terms of the problem we now observe?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He said, “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives young people the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the great questions of our time: how do we change this?
Because with young men, it is clear that something has gone wrong.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he will not participate in prequels or sequels of “Game of Thrones” next summer.
From November, Harington has been seen in a new edition by Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best was to have met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this mission, so in this way I have received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports increased 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way have been almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials announced at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the year comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalised in China, but the discrimination of LGBT community members is to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government promises, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees pushed the data of GOP senators, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, deputy at the U.S. House of Representatives, dismissed Saturday claims that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Deputy.
The Los Angeles Democrats declared that the claims of “ultra-law-oriented” experts and websites would be spread.
“Lies, lies, and even more hateful lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, which was published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual offences collected against the Supreme Court Candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the posts, was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were endangered by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the prosecution of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly raised online criticism, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman of the White House.
"This dementia is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
They should not be troubled.
You must not question the reasons of the defendant.
They have to be calm and left.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of having worked too angry during the hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took place in the half-time elections to remove Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that is true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that they are taken to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
“Johnny English – One Lives Only Three Three” – Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film. This seems to apply to this revival of the action-commedia-parody franchise "Johnny English", which in 2003 lived with "Johnny English - The Spiening who has been sitting" again and started with "Johnny English - Now" in 2011.
Will an ironic self-parody on the topic, how obviously deceitful we are, become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English has been renewed for the second time to massage the license of the glossy, cutting and incompetent Johnny English, which signals his name more than anything else that it is a general strange creation for movie visitors in the non-English space.
Of course, he is again the clogged secretary, who thinks bizarrely cool and worldwide, while in reality he has made up some clouseau, a clown Mr. Bean, and a clown of this guy who has contributed a single note to the title melody of “The Hour of Winner” at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Furthermore, the figure was originally based on the chaos left behind travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television sites.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval weapon and the rotor leaves slowed shortly to his helmet.
Atkinson’s capacity for physical comics comes at days, but humor seems quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the “serious” film series such as “007” and “mission impossible” now offer self-reliable comedian elements.
Humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misguides are not as intelligent and focused as Atkinson’s stumbling filmgags in the role of Bean.
The ever-current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much for the misfall of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and pressed figure already standing in front of the complete collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa-may character, but the script doesn’t give much she can work with.
Their intelligence advisors inform them that all active spies have been dismissed and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes the tolpatchy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a elegant facility, but offers unofficial lessons in the work as an undercover agent, while there are a few gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" reminding spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunified with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do everything terribly wrong in their Majesty's intelligence, are back in action while meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously in the ban of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve UK’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the grotesque vessels: as a caller dressed, they put a chic French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they smuggle on board Volta’s luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to get up with the interior with a virtual reality headset of Volta.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny she is also, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children’s TV.
Very moderate fabric.
Like the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really meets his talent?"
Labour refuses to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week but will be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants business managers to pass the savings achieved by the AI revolution (Artificial Intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to workers.
This means that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, “suits” the idea of the party’s economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The move to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the advantages of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy examination is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that aligns with the party’s approach to restoring the economic balance in the benefit of workers and with the party’s overall industry policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party is not supported by the Labour Party in general.
One spokesman for the Labour Party said, “A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was firmly determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” in public service companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water supply companies may not receive their entire share as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to appoint employees to the management of companies and establish Inclusive Ownership Funds to pass 10% of private enterprises’ own equity to employees casses up to 500 pounds annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the authority could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring some days, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I reported in the trial that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was expressed, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined and uncompromising.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be stuck in stone.
"My opinion is firm about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know: Brett has heavily disputed this,” Graham added and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone who called it couldn’t confirm it.”
It's 36 years now.
And I cannot find any changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, fighting poverty in the world with an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will be attending the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the seventh time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to sharpen the awareness of the actual goal of the event: fighting extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project. Within the framework of this project, an international stakeholder is trying to combat poverty by increasingly motivating people to actively participate in poverty combat.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen remains 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of providing a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you’re thinking to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions have helped encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or advertised by fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the UK who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million fighting undernutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions that urged Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which is to achieve 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the commonly asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They answered, “It will be a long and hard path with heights and depths.
But like the major citizen rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are among the artists that occur at this year’s New York event, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. could use the navy for blocking purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examination, Washington can resort to the navy if needed so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s operation in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently operating in these areas on the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the true reason for Russia’s operation in the Middle East is negotiating new sales markets in the energy sector, just as in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and ways to deal with this.
“The United States, together with the navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group, who is considered a “vote of electricity consumer” in the United States.
He took a comparison between Washington’s approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said while referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was working to expand the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia, the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “improper” pipeline project Nord Stream 2 which, according to Trump, became Berlin’s “prisoned” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to exercise pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industrie (BDI), has urged the United States to remain out of EU energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said the Board of Directors of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a 2020 presidential candidate to “examine correctly,” says Senator for Massachusetts
Massachusetts’ senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine precisely” a presidential candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine precisely” a presidential candidate after November 6th.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren took no leaf in his criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, obviously, a FBI investigation is required.
However, a survey published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe it should be candidated for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58% of the potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be able to candidate.
32% of voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38% who supported a potential candidate, and 48% who are against.
Other names of prominent Democrats in question in terms of a possible 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder under track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, everything that can feel about other families who feel the impact of the PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as a “elephant in the room” and told about her son and other war veterans that they changed returning, breaking back and wondering whether there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military gave the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of household violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police office.
18 states and DC support appeal to new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal appeal for new U.S. policies that refuse victims of band activities or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court expert declaration to Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-opposite-Session Suicide, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted against the federal policy in August, was not announced.
She announced that her partner “and his violent bandsons” abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace designated El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many people file a request for asylum in the United States, as nations that have great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has repeated a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014 that allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the escape of domestic violence.
District of Columbia’s Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores the tenth years of legislation at the state, federal and international level.”
“The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be judged based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement stated.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that policy refusing immigrants to access the country has a negative impact on the economy in the United States, as immigrants could work rather than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“There is asylum for anyone who leaves their home country because they are persecuted or fearful due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his announcement of June 11.
It was never the plan to remove all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race is doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little fierce son in a rescue centre in the destroyed city centre of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
“Clean drinking water is short.”
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to gather their wettest possessions and assets, while making everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were totally overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who attached to vertebral breaks and a broken shoulder, stayed outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were treated in the outside ground because of the ongoing strong aftercover.
With tears in his eyes he told how the heavy earthquake shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was clamped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help shouts, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassadors complain China’s tyranny with “propaganda announcements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-sided announcement in a US daily newspaper announced the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing to exploit the U.S. press for proganda purposes.
Last Wednesday, Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement to China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa after he accused China of engaging in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China disputes.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to engage in U.S. elections corresponds to the statement by U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to push China.
While it is common foreign governments to advertise for promoting the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outstanding trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and companies.
China, said Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the U.S.
“With the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of freedom of expression and independent press in America by shutting off the country’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing only in limited numbers of counter-votes and find no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese could have about China’s troubling economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Republican voters depreciate before the intermediate elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, observers warn
Since many of the most influential Republicans have supported and defended the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counterresponse during the upcoming intermediate elections, which could in particular come from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they continue with a vote.
“Such things cannot be repeated,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he was doubting that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last-minute assault is sufficient for an FBI investigation to remove angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the newspaper in Washington, D.C..
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate’s “November is coming!”, when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to arrest Kavanaugh’s nomination and that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the newspage.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with voters in the suburbs and with younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t choose.”
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidate of the Supreme Court, observers suggested that a counterresponse could result if the Republicans lead the confirmation.
“This situation is a wretched confusion for the GOP,” said early last week Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Board, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group supporting the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be discorded with whom they should believe due to the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share standing on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated they were definitely or probably believing Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied in his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI currently investigates the accusations made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford announced last week before the Senate’s judicial committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had unblown his genitals against her when she was on a party during her study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made the best thing that the intent behind Inrupt was the “world rule”.
“We have to be active now,” he said on the startup topic.
“This is a historical moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all contents are available in one browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about the personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development on data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available for everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers, and a security platform purchased by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not share with Facebook and Google on whether a comprehensive change will be made in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Media published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Viktoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his operation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never heard that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memory stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memory stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his bataillon over the Canal of Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy shot of field guns and machine guns.
Later he moved to the fire line and led the line forward with the “largest bravery” before having a field weapon in alone and triggering three of the military units.
Lieutenant Vann was shot on 4 October 1918 by a German sniper; a little more than a month before the end of war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never fit, while at the same time something that makes a humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown under the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the courage of a real hero will become visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to look at an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t look at the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock then, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the UK were not astonished to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after they remained awake until the early morning hours to specifically see the struggle.
A fan described the shift to the trick movie character on Twitter as a somewhat bad joke.
“As a rule on the part of the government, this content is classified as non-youth-free, so it had to be changed to a child shipment at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communication at Bellator when he was asked about the transmission.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
The Board of Directors at Bellator Scott Coker said the company will edit the expiry schedule to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think the problem could be solved in the repetition game," he said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning on a Sunday with the spectators in the UK, and we’re not going to solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're gonna keep it.
When the change was quite a lot communicated. It went pretty confused and it wasn't always everything nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we believe it is a technical disruption.
What wasn’t the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise that will not happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 rather than 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is pretty regretful.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels below sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says he grew up with the feeling of being lower to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized at the continued school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he has spoken on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories in the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months.
In Laverne’s first mission, he said that he considered himself less than others earlier because the love for boys and girls was entirely socially unacceptable.
He said, “Until today, the feeling of being lower and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The twice bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had expressed herself on this topic because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he learned in 2013, and the understanding of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He meant that when you were child and young, he took part in the Olympics for the first time at 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, it would have been all about gold medals.
But for him there is more important than Olympic Gold Medals.
His son Robbie is his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the nearby death, and one of the last things he asked about were tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be fully ahead.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that I became definitively understood that he is not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the domestic audience at Olympic games – that was crazy,” he said.
His first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it, he heard the song before the Olympic Games and still carrying out gainskin.

Mickelson, currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to strive very much so that the whole thing doesn’t become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank on Saturday by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of standing at the center of the event, the five-fold major winner spent his day shooting others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the highlight of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the square itself wasn’t dissatisfiing enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a newly played tournament, in the ninth game on Sunday to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points of residue lie a hot-start in the 12 single games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence on Mickelson and couldn’t add much to it either.
“He was fully clear about his role today, gave me a flap on his back and put his arm around me and thought he’s ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-famous personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it’s gone and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for the most Ryder Cup games held on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup run that never matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can win 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-time, though Furyk reported that his presence has already enriched the team alone.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few pieces, and he’s a great person who is popular with the entire team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it may soon be over with the forefront
Thomas Bjørn, Captain of the European Team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last single Ryder Cup games can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage of the Americans, but came just above the target line and led with the smallest possible advantage, with a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that’s just little,” Bjørn said (shown on the photo) after he saw the victory 5–3 of the class of 2018 on Friday and yesterday at 10-6 Le Golf.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
It's going to be right tomorrow.
Let's get into the thing and do the right thing.
The whole thing is over until the points on the display board are.
We've got a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s faced with us on the other hand: the best players in the world.”
Bjorn continued to say, “I would never overturn it.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual performances are at the forefront and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when the things run well, but when you’re alone out there, you’re tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
This must be made clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of it.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will make sure that his players individually cut off better than in the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that great turn on the last day of the tournament, standing in Brookline on the winner side before he stood towards Europe's "Wonder of Medinah" on the sides of the losers.
“I remember every damn word,” he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we'll try to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the duty to pick up for counter, he has to join in the top match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany’s new warship delays again
The latest fregate of the German Navy should have been placed in service in 2014 to replace the years of warships from the time of the Cold War, however, according to local media, it is delivered until earliest next year due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs.
The implementation of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the guide ship of the brand-new fregats of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling problems after the delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old fregats of the Bremen class.
They are intended to contain a powerful canon, a series of air defense missiles and sea destination bodies, as well as tarn technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregats do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
The continued delays, however, can lead to the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is expected to represent as a sea power, to be already outdated at the time they are launched in operation, says Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125 came into the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to drop the ship and returned it to the ship Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
There was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have made the new ship unusable in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, leading to loss of performance and preventing the navy from carrying out arms measures in the future.
The seven thousand tons of heavy “Rheinland-Pfalz” was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the initially expected €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that Germany’s sea power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestage’s military officer, confirmed that the navy “exit the employable ships.”
Bartels said the problem became greater over time, since old ships were taken out of service, but no substitute ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the navy.
National Trust Listen to the Secret Life of the Fledermouses
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are carried out to show how fleece mice use the landscape in the food search.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals, helping to guide future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will trace drums and mosquito fleece mouses as well as the brown longear and water fleece mouses in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of the fleece mouses throughout the entire season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In an analysis of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the bladder calls is determined and determined which species makes what.
Then a map and a report of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the mushrooms and how they are used by any species.
These data will help determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of grasslands, and show how to obtain forest areas for fleece mice and other related species.
In Scotland and the entire United Kingdom, the flood stocks have declined significantly in the last century.
They will be threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of habitat.
Wind wheels and lighting may also pose a risk, just as flyer and chemical treatment of construction materials or attacks by cats.
Flederm mouses are not really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an exhaustive echoerment to detect insects and obstacles in their pathway.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the topic of fleece mice very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts conducting regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only fleece reserve in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s 10 fleece species.
Gut Administrator David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for fleece mice,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we still don’t know about fleece mouths, so we do these works here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what fleece mouths need to feel comfortable.”
He emphasizes the importance of excluding the presence of fleece mouths before maintenance in goods first, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nist place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on site.
Fledermouses are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their niche sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains, “We still have to learn much about fleece mouths and in many of our species we don’t know what it’s about their populations.”
Ronaldo disputes charges of rape while his lawyers want to accuse German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape allegations raised against him as “fake news” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The attacker of the Portugal and Juventus National Team of Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, says The Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports just hours after it was released as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," the five-time winner of the Balloon d’Or told the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but this is part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the allegations they referred to as “unlawful reporting on suspicion in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of law infringement that is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was expected to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player's room, where he had raped them anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo went to his knees and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who would be giving “one percent”.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and left to take photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an extrajudicial agreement because she had "fear of retaliation" and worryed about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to revoke the agreement because it was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was shortly before switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid and switching this summer in a $100 million heavy deal to the Italian Giant Juve.
Brexit: Britain would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would “forever regret” if after Brexit it loses its status as a worldwide leading car manufacturer, Economic Minister Greg Clark said.
He continued to say it is "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would provisionally interrupt production in Burnaston at Derby if Britain should leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s product lines Auris and Avensis were produced last year, manufactured nearly 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our plant at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also caused concerns about a harsh EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and delays in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to run a stock in the factory in Derbyshire that is enough for more than one day, the company explained why production needs to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers’ plan on the future relationship with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he explained in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we have to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not indicate how long production should be interrupted, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functionary of the Unite union in the work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience has never come back these jobs once they are left.
One government spokesman said, “We have introduced a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be shifted again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's major meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "be shifted for another week" while the dispute on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has surveyed the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigated Russia’s election mixtures, connections between Trump’s advisors and Russia, as well as possible judicial impairment by the president.
The question whether Trump would fire the vice minister of justice and thus threaten Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for the month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secret recording his talks with Trump and the removal of the president’s office using the 25th constitutional add-on.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports were known about his alleged resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday.
Trump explained that he would not prefer to release Rosenstein, however, the meeting was then displaced to avoid conflicting with the hearing before the U.S. Senate’s judicial committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesman Sarah Sanders released on Sunday on Fox News.
On a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “A date has not yet been set for it; it might be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be moved for another week in the face of all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably oppose this claim: Sanders has no longer held a press conference of the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not attempt to abstinct the TV reporter’s “effect hazard” but admitted: “I wouldn’t deny that they operate effect hazard.”
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-answer rounds than any president before him,” she explained, without proof of accurate evidence: “We have looked at these figures.”
Press conferences will still be, says Sanders, however, if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, which will take the seat of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may show why this is so when he dropped a bizarre appearance running out of the rudge before gathering reporters.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns on EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from the EU abroad who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and to express the desire to stay in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already agreed to bear the cost of applications for residence title for EU citizens working in the decentralized public service of Scotland.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know what troubling times this must be for you all.
That is why I once again wanted to express how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Linebacker Christion Abercrombie was submitted to emergency operation after a head injury from Mike Organ of Tennessee State on Saturday during the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed said the injury occurred shortly before half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the side line before he was placed on a wear and deported for further investigations.
A spokesman of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details about the nature or extent of the injury are yet known” and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, is playing in his first season at Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, which increased his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for purchasing real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. Additional revenues are expected to benefit homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step aims to isolate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
Increase of stamp fees will affect anyone who does not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects more income of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors must pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with multi-income to benefit homeless.
This step is an attempt to remove Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable living space and to take a look at top-winning voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and additional income will be transferred to the government campaign against homelessness.
The supply, in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase in second apartments and residential property left to rent two years ago, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance estimates the step to increase income of up to 120 million pounds a year.
Estimated 13 percent of rebuilt real estate in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the UK, thus driving prices up to the level and makes it harder for the first time buyers to foot in real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson pronounced a reduction in stamp tax to enable more young people to get their first home.
He accused construction companies to hold real estate prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain’s “housing.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking set of proposals for residential reforms, ranging from a lease price bond to the prohibition of spaces without any reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, according to which life should be better from generation to generation.
And that is to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far away for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains too much problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says it’s his ‘biggest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of bringing new life to the club from the North-East of England, which is just on the third place in the League One and miss the three points at the top.
He moved this summer to the Stage of Light after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got it to the bank and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports.
“But as a child I’ve seen Scotland playing with my father in Hampden often and that’s something that always takes me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I would be successful in association management."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to get into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment in whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
“Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he is without doubt belonging to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get him there, but I would probably consider my time here only as a success if I bring the association back there.”
Ross can present a only three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was probably a real pathway,” he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange as I didn’t feel bad, could live good of it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt as well in my skin throughout my life as an adult.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30th, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30 a.m., a study says.
The heat wave in summer missed the revenues of Britain’s crashing pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and cash companies increased revenues by 2.7% in July, but revenues at the restaurants dropped by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin from CGA’s company advisory, which compiled the numbers, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs increased sales of 2.8%.
The decline of 1.8% from the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed at a distance the best performance, with a surface-adjusted revenue development that increased higher than it dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to get out on a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, drink revenues increased by 6.6% a month, while sales of food declined by three percent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM recreational and restaurant analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we could see since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to deal with problems, however, sales losses of 4.8% compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer would not have been able to come at any worse time for businesses focusing on food and it remains to wait to see if the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the highly needed breakdown.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.

One of five children owns secret accounts on social media that hide it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some only 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that holds it secret before parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools has found an increase in so-called “Fake Insta” pages
The message fires fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of students said they own a “major account” to show it to their parents.
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret before adults.
A survey among 20,000 students at further schools showed a quick increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing website.
The message fires fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of students said they own a clean “major account” that they can show to their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother who met on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged another to “rape me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistress’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half agreed to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are led to create online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be a "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Athletics Dach Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most commonly excellent light athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the light athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit very much from their choice in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m looking forward to acting as a voice of the athletes and hope I can make a real contribution and guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, calls his own four Olympic gold medals and today frequently appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a preliminary blood circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!”
Advertising of milk pumps that compares mothers to cows ensures excitement on the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement on the network with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers were compared to the melting of cows.
In order to launch the “first sound-free portable milk pump worldwide”, the consumer technology manufacturer Elvie publishes a not very seriously meant music video to emphasize the freedom given to the pump breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shell filled with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines such as: “Yes, I melk, but you don’t see me a tail” or “if you didn’t notice, they are not yours but my breasts.”
Refrain continues to say, “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I melt my ladies.”
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has triggered controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video came towards mixed reactions among the spectators, many of which say it is harmless to the milk industry’s “smalls”.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Like we, they have to become poor and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days after birth," he said in a commentary.
Elvie's milk pump fits decently in a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary was: “Traumatic to mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such a foreign advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that she found the song “urchest.”
“I think that’s an incredible idea.
I would have bought one if I still breastfeed.
When pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
“This is a great product,” a person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at workplace or toilet) and feel like “cows.”
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their barbecue.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the recognition that many women using milk pumps indicate feeling like milk cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a still-BH, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a brave and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that are accompanied by, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that allows the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a twofold mother appeared on the Catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were silently and quietly brought into a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of internized migrant children is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things because the Trump government’s harder rhetoric and measures have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid of becoming the target for an expulsion when they sign up to accept a child.
The risk increased in June, as federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Authority Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had announced to care for unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested did not have previous entries in the criminal register.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household remain illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That’s why we will continue to track these people,” said Albence.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children faster, the officials introduced new rules that required accommodation employees in some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video circuit and not personally to enter for their legal status before an immigration judge.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children stay in detention, the more likely it is, according to accommodation employees and reports that have been known from the system in the past month that they are fearfully and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger facility like Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems will be easier forgotten due to the size.
They also explained that there could be traumas that many of the children already suffer if they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to farewell with friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, also deputy prime minister, said the foreign armed forces were illegally treated on Syrian ground with the pretext of fighting terrorism.
“You have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terror has almost been over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions were driven out of their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian areas are cleansed” by both terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish armed forces and Syrian Arabs who are hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 floor troops in the war-pocketed country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return are given and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” to prevent refugees from going home.
"We have urged the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable home returns," he said.
“They politize a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid will be granted to Syria unless there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel highburg Idlib represents the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey deployed a widespread offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists will be carried out, including fighters of the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, which will “be deleted.”
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to call for the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and create the way to elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the Committee and declared that his work should be limited to the “revision of the articles of the current Constitution” and warned from mixtures.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his reelection in 2020, not as many liberal spectators probably hope to end his presidency withdrawal or a scandal in advance.
This would without doubt be “the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times.”
So far, there are no signs that the spectators were tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcasting start rates have doubled to 1.05 million more than 2, and MSNBC has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the start rates to 3.5 million spectators at evenings with important news.
“This is like a fire that attracts people magically because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neal Bear, the showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” broadcast on the ABC TV channel over a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an ancient comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he brings me to laugh’,” Scovell told me.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike everything to be found on television, can determine the future of the basic decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it’s also going to be an informed citizen when you become aware of having already looked at six hours of a round of experts that dissatisfies about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from strange leather”
I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he does can feel like a reality show he is proposing for every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pandhouse”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily action applications.
You can’t afford to miss a consequence, otherwise you won’t come with.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he cracked inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t get rid of the screen, not when judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh came in front of the Senate’s judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy broadcasts at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donation money floats the nearest races for seats in Congress at the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donation money, thanks to the recent borders of the election districts, which led to two officials standing around the same seat in the race.
The recently drawn forstad district in Pittsburgh leaves the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his headquarters in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb joins another officer, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State's Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were deep against the Constitution and manipulated in the favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district caused a strike exchange of the campaign financing between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly observed special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This headquarters was held for over a decade by a Republican and Trump won 20 percentage points forward there.
Politicians give Democrats a light leadership.
The US examined El Salvador’s punishment for his support for China, but then returned.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without meeting great resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero and owned a Panama hotel until partners threw the Trump Organization’s management team away.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign conferences from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry in a statement early this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was thought of penalty, which was estimated to receive $140 million in 2017, including drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalty measures, including reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made clear that they wish the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now planned as a spokesman at the conference held in mid-October to put a sign of the importance of the assembly’s government.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new reports or criminal measures from Washington.
A government spokesman by John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to comment on the internal meetings.
Their comments were reaffirmed by one of the government’s close external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next major surprise could be the report of the Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible judicial impairment, for which there is sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now supposed to investigate whether Trump’s campaign team has conspired with Russia in his attack on the U.S. elections.
If the majority of the Congress changes, Trump will face an organ that forces him to be accountable precisely at the time he passes on to go back in front of the voters; and possibly in front of a jury.
These are many "if" and I don't want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European partners, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will influence how long the struggle will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had just made him resistance and the Czechoslovaks had supported in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just in front of several of these turn points.
What do we do if Trump leaves Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides about the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the Devil's cuisine since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculate about it, highly unsuitable for the office.
Rosenstein denies the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly arranged FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statement in office?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a Congress that forces Trump to account for?
If we fail in these tests, a long winter is in front of us.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime who once had occupied my ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me away to inflammate sabbath crabs on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain will put them into a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jump board for bigger.
“This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the belief that we can do something from it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have finally won, but overall a decision was probably a fair outcome.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we strive for the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy match because they have achieved a good result in the last match, but I am sure we can go through that with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good on it; the training is good.
I hope we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of pension leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although participants in the survey knew exactly how to maintain them, few talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Party of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be maintained, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Take your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Resolve disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary power so that you are committed to a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals meet your wishes, you should not be able to express them themselves.
Also consider an authority for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drug intake or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job among friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that occurred at about 02:30 British time, as “willbearing action”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, the authorities say.
Due to the failure of communication systems, helpers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main income sources of the Central Sulawesian economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel degradation is also of importance in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly attacked by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December unleashed a tsunami, which hit 14 countries and cost 226,000 people to live in the coastal areas of the Indian ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shocked the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the Sumatra coast.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shocked the southern Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and demanded nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the town of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-strong earthquake shocked one of the islands of Mentawai in front of Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters of height, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 people’s lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people died by collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes occurred among tourists popular Indonesian island Lombok and claimed more than 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin’s son arrested for charges of household violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and former candidate for the office of Vice-President, was arrested due to allegations of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to the suspicion of domestic violence, disabled reporting of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, a report published on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, he took off the telephone from a acquaintancing person when he wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in investigative arrest at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where when he was asked about his plaintiff with “Not guilty, surely,” the network said.
Palin is accused of committing three class A illegals, which can be punished with up to one year’s prison penalty and a fine of up to $250,000.
He will also be charged with an irregular class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It’s not the first time that criminal charges were raised against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called for police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting of a crime and weapon possession under the effect of an accident in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend argued him to have beaten her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after returning her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi shocked on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and the number of dead will be assumed to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred shortly off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Attorneys Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The federal law firm in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack in New York City, which cost eight people’s lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, as a result of which he walked a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, while travelling pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the allegators must prove that Saipov "targeted" killed the eight of the Ofer and "consciously caused serious body injuries," the statement of intent for the claim of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation court, Saipov, presented an accusation in 22 points, which includes eight accusations of murder in the background of the organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an accusation of the exercise of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires “basic planning and intention,” according to the allegators, who described the nature in which Saipov carried out the act as “hateful, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added Diego Enrique Angelini’s families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses.”
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer been pursuing a case with the aim of calling for the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifelong freedom punishment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was accused of conspiracy for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of a lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He said before investigators to feel good with what he did, police say.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos by ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also called for ISIS to hang the flag in his hospital room.
He was not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “self-disappointed” due to the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction in exchange for a lifelong freedom penalty without possibility of dismissal will only extend the trauma that all stakeholders are suffering,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party Deputy Calls for Nigel Farage to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest action during the Conference of the Tories.
Ukip’s former party chief said politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a Theresa May’s Party member suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backpacker Peter Bone declared to Birmingham demonstrators that the United Kingdom would “really be outside” if Farage would be the Brexit minister.
The challenge that May faces in reconciliating her deeply disputed party was exacerbated by participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping Chequers’ compromise plan in spite of attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite counter-reactions they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belongs to the garbage’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed to a peer, and that he should have transferred the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we would be already outside," he said.
Wellingborough’s member added, ‘I’m going to stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
His opposition to the EU emphasized: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit supporter of Conservatives Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and said to reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a high message to May, she continued: ‘Premier Ministers retain their jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that the politicians have to ‘feel pressure’ they should just be coming to fraud the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“You’re trying to deceive Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them ‘then you’re not coming from it.’
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued to say, ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is shortly before betraying Brexit.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which helps us to win in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self-managing, proud UK.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour run in the city center.
A few activists rolled banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, was funny about the tories who had security issues with a party app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure the IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus, are present for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” says Adonis.
“This is a farce.
“There’s just no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ the presidential candidate
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she will “examine the presidential candidate accurately.”
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats talked about their future on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a stated critic by President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the reelection for the Senate against the Republican Deputy in Massachusetts Parliament Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the present persons asked her if she wanted to candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested after death shots on LSU players Sims
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that he had arrested the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11am in the morning.
They published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shooting injury at the head and died as a result of this injury,” said Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was investigated and admitted to being at the crime site and possessing a weapon and shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any further incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter-wide Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 startups last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in Qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stallorder would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into the traffic at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a round later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overcome him after a short wheel-an-wheel maneuver where the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inner side with the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the rear squares of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He then was the fastest for most of the race, as he felt his tyres to quickly end and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take one step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen ended as the fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri brought excellent performance throughout the weekend and how a real gentleman acted when he should leave me past.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory,” Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump went fun at a election campaign on Saturday on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who continued to have not passed the letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which they proposed sexual abuse to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement to the Senate’s Justice Committee did not address directly, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and unhonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people angry, and common, and evil, and imhonest,” the president said.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t I.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... You published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, a moment, please.
“No, we didn’t publish it,” he added by imitating the senator’s voice.
The letter with Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh was played in July and it was released in early September, however, Feinstein disputes that the leak comes from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I discussed her request for confidentiality.”
Her dementie seemed not to get good with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, whom three women accused sexual attacks, Democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
“You see the mutity, evilness, they don’t care about who they hurt when they’re dropped under the wheels to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 victory in the return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants went in front early with two gates, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard looked like Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe who unexpectedly beat Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening gate was made in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a template by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the template as Beauvillier expanded the guide.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the match after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped his compensation gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of the Giants before the half-time break when he reached his second gateway of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team re-grouped and Bouchard again looked like a power play match in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match late in the second half, and Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth gate after just half the second half.
The Giants who lost four of their last five games will play next Friday at the Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flyers died after he was sure hundreds of people in an airplane escaped from the earthquake
A flight lot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after death to launch an aircraft with hundreds of people safely on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershadows are still felt in the region and many people are caught under ruins in the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the starting track at the time, could safely remove.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he fell down.
Agung died later in the hospital.
The spokesman of Indonesian aviation safety service, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News said.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities were afraid that the number of deaths could increase to several thousands, while the country’s disaster protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the ruins, while others cannot be reached,” said Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, which will keep a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short.
Everywhere supermarkets are plundered.”
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastes to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and declared in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all tasks associated with evacuation.
“Since you’ve been ready?” says CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft Crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Reports Missing After Aircraft Crash in Lagune
The airline that carried out the flight dropped into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reported a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the dropping aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that until Saturday afternoon they can say nothing about the remaining of a passenger.
The airline announced to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officers reported that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline said on Saturday six passengers were in the hospital but were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact outcome of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the landing railway.
Some witnesses thought the plane would fly beyond the landing railway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very flat.
“This is a very good thing,” says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to walk to the emergency outputs on the sides of the dropping plane through depth of water.
He said the flight companions were panicked and shouted and he suffered a smaller headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working nearby to improve an investment station, running to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane dropped in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them were concerned with Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the run of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The charge on Saturday concluded her evidence in the rehearsal of a case in which a man is accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analytics of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, explained for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said he had received position data from various phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers in the evening of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, the newspaper Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford went to witness on Saturday and said he had not been in the city on that day.
When the accusers asked whether Tellis had said the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lying, “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another opposition was that Tellis said he knew Chambers at his death time for two weeks.
Mobile phone records indicated that they knew each other a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released his messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chamber's death.
“He removed them from his life,” says Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pleaders on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.

A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political embassy and social commitment.
They want to return to his roots and again socially conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently learned a renaissance by artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black?!
New York's Children's Couples Suited for Dismissal by "Racist" SMS
A New York children's girl accuses a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal, after receiving a misdirected message from the mother, in which she accused she was "even a black".
The couple disputes to be racist and compares the dispute with a "expression".
Two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her amazement when she found out that the new daymother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEIN, NEW ONE BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released and claimed that the open African-American day mother had done bad work and expected a Philippine woman instead, the New York Post said.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice claims the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims a compensation for the $350 per day, which she should last for six months, the job for which she had been booked originally, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do this,” she explained to the Friday newspaper, “I know that discrimination is.”
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, and argued that the dismissal of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after insulting them, to no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was unhealthy to them even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a "expression" and explained that his wife was waiting for a baby in just two months and "sits in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to make such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment bank added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly sentenced in public and accused on social media where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, a new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge today about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the child's book, would have had no problem with it, would have been rejected from his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the release after his death last year was "bitterly sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as a “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t boast,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you have a child that makes something special: you’re proud, even though it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Padding's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her via the phone.
After landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors were trying to save their lives.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received the call from Nad in which he told me she would die in the next two minutes and I need to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I told her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly sounded and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break myself together.”
Lastly, Ednan-Laperouse went on the plane, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers, who didn’t know what she was passing through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears walked through my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women hang maps to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost a suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys were hanging on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting facilities.
Davi’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel like I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that this might have a follow-up effect.”
Davis designed the cards to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you’re a friend.
Don’t stay quiet: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, whom she was together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the deep point, and when the kids packed their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything.”
She said that her death was a big trauma for her, but that there had to go through: “It bursts a huge hole into the family.
It breaks us down.
We all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the slow while the FBI starts investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like that he asked about, so a timely and limited investigation, then we might get a little consciousness," Flake said on Saturday. He fears the committee would "disrupt in the party-political standing."
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your rejection can be returned to the timing alone.
The interim elections on 6 November are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans cut poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phone headphones to call and convince senators to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presented its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice-President Mike Pence to decide in equal votes and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossers 'slow' under Kim
The number of North Korean crossers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean politician said.
Park Byeong-such, who calls for data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, declared that last year 1127 transitors were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher human smuggler prices as main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak publicly.
The vast majority of Northern transitors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the crossers rather illegal immigrants than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relationships between the north and the south, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to first disarm one-sided," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court.
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was characterically inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi told her response to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied all charges that he abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he shouted almost and stood in tears before breaking up when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a “grotest and coordinated reputation murder” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court because she showed that he was prejudiced to Democrats.
“I believe he has declared himself inadequate with these statements and the way he conducted about the Clintons and the Democrats,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from the office should he be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court but also for his current judge posts,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that she was concerned as a Democratic for Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearing, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We now don’t need a hysteric, preconceived person who goes to this Court and expects from us to say, ‘Ah, that’s not wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere speech of hate, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We’re crying when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued to say: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was manager somewhere and said she was also crying when she gets angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and begins to cry, tell her to the person she said, ‘You may think that I am sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then you just keep speaking.
I found that great."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in a office dominated by men, where I one day cryed because of an inscriptible anger and an older woman, an undercooled manager whom I was always afraid, was packed on the collar and pulled into a staircase.
“Let them never see you’re crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re more smellful.
They believe you are sad and will be happy with them because they believe you’ve gone into the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was captured on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidate, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
“That was not a good-thinking decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Snow Witches and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the election campaign had already been advanced, she was behind the financial acquisition and she swore not to candidate if it was not to reach $2 million.
It was a seemless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 men supported their campaign only with $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch any official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the voters so difficult to purchase funds and direct addressing instead of delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, so close to tears.
“You could have supposed that I suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket towel manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember, I wondered what they might write on my grave stone.
“You crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit from Trade War between the United States and China
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China were ear-threatening. Although the battle hasn’t been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term dip between countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, closed the first warning shot early this year when he confessed important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with penalties.
The most significant escalation was carried out this week with new penalty tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing declined each time in the same way and recently raised penalties from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to answer any U.S. measure and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic power will soon blow up.
To move Washington to slow it would mean to give up, however, a public slow-up to the United States would be too damaging for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, my experts say if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the impact of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have recognized before,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee focused on Asia’s Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the over seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the circumstances in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government rebuilds the territories destroyed by terrorists to revert normality.
All conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and basis.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed help in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He emphasized, however, that there would be no support from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a range of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has no longer won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over most of the tournament, dronked his decline on the 16th train (Par 3) in water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who won a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in his current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 out of 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Usually I didn’t cry, but today I couldn’t retain.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so infinitely happy to win back the cup.
It’s about the team and I’m glad to have made a contribution,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continued to reach the fackel to his countryman John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
“I’m so proud of beating Tiger Woods that I’ve been chasing on television since my childhood,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 major title and is only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had trouble finding the fairways throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have made high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the guys they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything.
Hat away for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players decreased good performance.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to talk to PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we’re going to look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
