Inflation in Europe declined on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is primarily due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price rise in the 13 countries of the eurozone was higher than forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was registered, the Luxembourg European Community Statistics Office said.
Official forecasts have indicated only 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the principal interest rate by saying that the decrease in interest, with the growth in raw material prices and the decrease in unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflation spirale.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to an analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to dissuade" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this topic later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area declined due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain market ratings have increased by 88 percent and soybean price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation rate will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it will drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the steering rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Indicates Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December, and since 2002, it has now had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Poll Institute) has never previously found such a low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of the opposition voters, more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is 2% throughout the population.
On loyal voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high as it is 41 percent, and according to 46 percent complementary, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic perspectives of the spring and last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expecting an aggravation and only one tenth is expecting an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of people surveyed, namely a majority never seen during Gallup’s previous surveys, decided that the prime minister did his work rather badly than well.
13 percent of the surveys have a lot of confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister and 27 percent the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political change is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While after the last October riots, 35 per cent of the surveyed wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in charge, this rate currently accounts for only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) estimates that new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question concerning the intent of vote, 60% of the surveyed respond that they would certainly vote and the 20 percent complementary say that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "next Sunday legislative election," only 55 percent of the surveyed would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate in complementary. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be doubtful.
74 percent of people would say no to enrollment rights in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation expenses, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay expenses.
When we only look at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and stay fees in the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets in Budaörs’ commercial triangle maintained the average price increase by 16 percent last year, unlike this year’s VAT rate didn’t increase.
Article by Napi Gazdasag (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs trading triangle, the usual daily Christmas Bag also increased by an average of 16 percent, a significantly higher than a thousand forints increased in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already flyed in major food stores last December, no longer increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items bought significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily cart in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forint.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained almost at last year, however, the prices of duck, nut and powder have increased significantly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but in Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to only 139 forints.
Competition did not decrease the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle contained two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the contained bottle including.
This year, in terms of daily cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing the most expensive cart of last year and the most expensive cart of this year, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between the most expensive cart of last year and the most expensive cart of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased on average by 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not visiblely determine which margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader wrongly calculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to trade intensity.)
Due to the change in VAT rate, the increase in daily cart prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than that of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the most expensive basket value was 1,630 forints higher than last year, and the cheapest prices increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic price rise, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some primary feeds, the statistical institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Bag, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they managed to accept the brutal price rise by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy all in quantities, they take long-contained foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed at the boxes of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased suddenly.
But, according to our information, revenue is less significant in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that not even reach the planned revenue, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many Hospitals Make Economy on Disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, primarily caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overdriving of medical staff do not help block infections, says the chief doctor at the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also economy on disinfectants
A MRSA infection has been diagnosed long ago at the service of traumatology at the Janos Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The sick was isolated.
In the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured from a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after he had to return there because of an MRSA infection and since, doctors could not make an important operation for him because of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogenic agent have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogenic agent that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angines, amygdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healed.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacteria that will proliferate quickly in bad hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged poor functioning of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infections or septics, on elderly, small weights or with weakened body.
According to the director doctor of the Janos Hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
The infection with the epidemic should not be confused, we do not find MRSA only, or we do not look for them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These sick are isolated, the caregivers put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for curing them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they have MRSA, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample taking is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistent pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is manifested mainly in hospitals and senior residences, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA patients.
However, microbiological samples are not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these exams.
Most cases only come to date if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the chief doctor of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the adequate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
It is necessary to make efforts for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take it into account.
The realization of microbiological samples is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many Hospitals Make Economy on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, put gloves and protective masks, however significant gaps are detected in hospitals as well in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by droplet inhalation and contact, however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
Furthermore, the rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, savings on disinfectants, lacking nurses, many sick, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable manner or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security boxes, which is why we fight everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is a priority to prevent the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and to prevent hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Commissioner, author of a deadly accident, was not in a state of drunk
The official findings relating to the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd District were drawn up.
It can be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd District, who has resigned from his post since, who has crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunk or stubborn condition, said Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative findings have been established.
The conclusion confirmed the first outcome of the investigation that has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting on the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police office crushed a 55-year-old man who faced him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd district.
(In addition, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for retirement because, according to the police report, this accident has greatly disturbed him.
The investigation on this case is carried out by the Prosecutor’s Office of Investigations in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), on Friday signed three agreements with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the financing of Hungarian transport and environmental projects to be achieved from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties, this time the signed contract relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of EUR 150 million also relates to the financial funding of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later after the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, the state budget will first use this envelope as part of the research and development project to be achieved at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of line 4 of the subway was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would rediscover the eventual amendment to the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of subway funding with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the funding of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits based on the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe has been turned towards this Balkan country in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market which is always the cheapest but who will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most vogue target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap seaside.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shore, Albena, the "Golden Sails", the "Côte du Sole", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna region and Balcik as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly numerous to buy in the very cheap corner of Russe.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, shops and offices promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in a large number, for example in the corner of Bansko.
Analysts say people purchasing a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since last December, Bulgaria is cited among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term plus-value.
The price of capital buildings is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, in the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, professional meetings will end Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Sheet that is expected to define efforts to be made after the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, heavy discussions are being held on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that at the moment they did not want to discuss exact figures, although they were ready to sign an agreement on reduction of 25 to 40 percent greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is to see whether developed countries are committed, excluding emission reductions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors of 16 probably members within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, confirms the EU’s ambition to retain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signature of the “After 2012 Agreement”, and it was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make their responsibility.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signed by the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all of the 15 EU members of that time took the commitment by 8 per cent increasingly.
Hungary has taken its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release from the Ministry of Environment.
The issue is big in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be established within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be repeated after 2012. In this case, Nobel Climate Reduction commitments below the values set out in the UN Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international system of reduction in emissions underlined the international IPCC.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the rise in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celcius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruit on YouTube
The British army units communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of making themselves popular.
First of all, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who has been passionate about YouTube: the special units speaking in Afghanistan charge video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and then transferred to Londres or the compatriots loading them on the Internet.
The political message is indispensable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this path and their "chain" was watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence enrolled in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and it communicates videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial goal of the air force, the videos were brought on the net to recruit, and according to the Department of Defense, they also served to make the public known the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this path costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, reported to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, advisor in defence, but also inevitably carrying a political message as it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is embarrassed because, except for composed and carefully censured videos, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrites, officers don't avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
Furthermore, many videos had already been brought on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were performed in a real mission, but the British army only packed for loading these videos recently.
The Americans do recruitment a little differently by using the American Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game, the player can get directly in the place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas Tombola and beacons in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a late-year meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 by taking beacons and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Feast, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so you have fun of power.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas holiday will be held by the Ministry of Defense, but it is not the department’s employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred fifty are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
NFÜ's Christmas cost 4,700,000 forint and was organized Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
Renting the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, tender company manager.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to contact the responsible.
The costume is not compulsory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas holiday, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on December 7th.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of their rooms.
The ball counted five hundred people.
The party started with the minister’s welcome words and dinner was followed by a live music dancing evening.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not at all mandatory to this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and local authorities are preparing a super party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forint.
On the other hand, the minister of work, Mónika Lamperth, does not officially invite its employees to a Christmas holiday but to a late-year work meeting.
One hundred eighty people are expected to be invited to drink a coffee and eat beans, the press service announced, the party will only cost 350,000 forint.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of local authorities, will simply invite its employees to drink a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of local authorities and territorial planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room with 436 employees expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No anticipated holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister’s exhibition but also by the hour of the holiday taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas holiday will not take place.
The reception will be held at the Castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the Wood of City, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forint per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail that only accredited foreign diplomats in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press department of the Ministry of Environment did not know the official Christmas award.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The mega strike forces gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Labour Councils will constitute their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the indeterminate strike on Monday.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Cash Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant stoppers in traffic because rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV employees will also strike up to 13:00 a.m.
The League Syndicates will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers’ Counsel.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday’s actions.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indetermined period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of voting to Parliament on the Health Cash Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Cash Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the following.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Cash Act will take place only late in the evening or even night.
Due to the Monday strike, major closures are scheduled in the traffic: the railroads will stop work for an undetermined period and during the morning a part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are likely to be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, the list of them is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations report to strike for an undetermined period of time, others reported a temporary stop of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Iron Chemins) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZZ) failed to reach a minimum service agreement, but, in the approach to Christmas holidays, more and more are those taking the train.
According to current communications, public transportation from Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 13:00, Budapest airport between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning, the Industrial Electricity and thermal energy unions of the League will strike four hours, the union of professors and the democratic union of professors have called for 2 hours to strike.
The National Association of Doctors will strike throughout the country alternating, the SZEF-related Health and Social Sector Employees’ Trade Union (EDDSZ) will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several steps.
The third claim requires a guarantee in terms of retirement before legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to pass into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economic and Transportation relating to secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increased Country Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyaroszágért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning,” the society reports that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that “short-term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Zigan population and not Zigan population of Hungary.”
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard to probably cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main gaps of Hungarian political actors: “The public actors have passed the public debate on the matter of the Roma to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Zigans and the Hungarians.”
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding confidence in the country’s stability and democratic maturity.”
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 called the "National Self-Defense Association".
“The common characteristic of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, order defence), armed forces should, if necessary, be further mentioned by the inability of the police, the army, otherwise the state,” they added.
They reported that everything was happening according to the method that, based on the rancore of political society and parties, seeks to dress different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The focus on the civilian nature and association status therefore only serves to avoid legal traps from the registration of these associations in the court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases risk compared to neighborhood relationships.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultranationalist political actors in some border countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the entire region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, resembles the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union in August 2007.
The many Roms disturbances that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the cause of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to constitute a guard, saying the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Zigans have “terrorised” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative raised vibrant debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian Roma organizations concerning the establishment of their own guard as a resistance indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Romans respond to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, it can be read in the Political Capital risk warning.
At the request for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and whether events occurring that could have an impact on risk change, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law exactly defines the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Parties are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious feasts or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter more so that awakening people can rest quietly.
In one year, we have all eleven feasts marked in red.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the labour party, and on November 1 and 2 we remember members of our family and deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious feasts rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or there is only a working day left before or after the celebration marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Labour Minister has decided in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the feasts.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, officials and people working in public service.
It does not, however, apply to services societies, institutions turning without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end-of-year holidays: from December 24, life almost ends throughout the country because, according to experiences, most people do moreover overtime or take vacation that they saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year’s Day home.
Next year a lot of holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganised for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at their home four days accompanied.
Saturday, 25 April will be a working day for a rest day on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18, will be a working day replacing Friday, 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year’s Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly disturb colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these trouble or we face the challenge and we consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been called from the marketing service," a colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he's sorry and try to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he's forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with apology.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, office tool or phone and you don’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember that last night you put the gripper on the desk but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be angry on you for having whipped their good.
Don't bring back any envelope, post-it into your pocket because it may be annoying that there's no more and you need it right away.
Your colleagues' privacy potters?
There are no good ways to stop potatoes that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t miss his trust!
Buy the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Do you declare you sick without just reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under pretext of a torn headache because you feel bad or you feel need to rest that day, think that your work, your urgent affairs, your missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't make any trouble with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won’t go to work or something might happen that would force you to stay at your home, don’t forget to warn your chief and colleagues to prevent them from surprising your absence the next day.
Freaking, ripping, phone
Do you dive into your job, but the richness of your colleagues takes you off brutally?
Have you become a witness to a phone discussion that you would have done better not to listen?
Don’t disturb your colleagues with loud talks (which you are leading above their heads), feet beatings, big words, or loud-speaking dissatisfaction.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you accuse others for a fault?
If your work is not done for the fixed deadline, you forget to send a message or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetting!
Do not put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a fault and if it has shown disadvantages for others, repair the fault!
Ask how you could repair your fault, repair negligence!
Are you feeling too home at the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not make a comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don’t be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting the sound up.
Music changes its rhythm and the bass comes to accompany all-time tones, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life hasn’t spoiled us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now, it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new garage rock fashion that breaks the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched his own path, perhaps because “there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.”
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted to the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 cited their first 2002 album among the fifty largest Hungarian records and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the virtually only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole have undoubtedly become “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted as appropriate, it released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years past in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but next to the air music now appears, according to the mind and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a true tube for radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has recently broadcast popular music from morning to evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube drives me to ask a question: Has your music well remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aimed at a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Self-saying alternatives, underground music can also be poor and done only to sell them and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the young one or twenty years old but also the elderly.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Obviously, I’m happy to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made any music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the unmissable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made career instead in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his way even though sometimes try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust the musical presence of each other and let’s deploy themselves.
At the beginning, it was inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to sweet the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir of the genus gospel.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the choral was composed to six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or the girls changed it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought it was still missing something to this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody the girls learned later.
I had it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed like the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing stronger than music, so music doesn't only accompany their song.
They were behind the stage too.
Was it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute roles as a solist.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes, or just let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to also feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work most?
Zs.B.: In truth, none about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything started as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “left” this record.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader risks billions because of its complex of lowerness
A hidden fraudulent.
Thus, his former employee, the French giant, designated the Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros due to it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized in time the American mortgage market crisis.
"He's fragile," he said, who denounced him to the police.
However, if it comes to Kerviel's report report by the French media, including Le Monde, that man's transactions produced a profit of €1.6 billion in late last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called “sub-prime” mortgages awarded to low-income customers or those who had encountered in the past refund difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"When I had won my first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says and adds that he, of course, didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed that he had misleaded the reports to not be screened.
He managed to duplicate his seniors, although the Eurex scholarship began to be interested in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Did he be afraid to be discovered?
Rather no.
"I estimated that the simple fact of having obtained 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where comes his willingness to risk so big?
He only reached his position gradually.
He began working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, he became independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than others.
With regard to my academic course and my professional and personal course,” said investigators Kerviel.
Soon after he entered his job, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz’s actions, he earned a half a billion euros by bet on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
"There was like a snowball effect," he told police officers.
But the seniors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted.
As long as I was winning, they felt to close my eyes.”
This is then that the start of the year happens.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we discover it?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
“Last year, I only took 4 days of leave.
A trader who doesn’t take a holiday is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” said Kerviel.
Czech Republic has an opportunity to earn 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which in the coming years could bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
It is about half the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be intended for Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns as part of the Enterprise and Innovation program.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part, up to 150 billion.
The Transport is the most important operational programme and accounts for up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Rep can obtain as part of these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transportation Infrastructure Fund that will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Program, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of more effective new management methods.
So far, the Czech Rep was part of the least successful EU funding beneficiaries among the new members.
The Court confirmed 20-year prison sentence for former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released and lived assigned to residence in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state, in charge between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again imprisoned at the moment, according to the AP agency, is not clear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his punishment at his home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
These were fictional companies and accounts actually belonged to his family members and his nearest supporters.
Part of that money went into the funds that German had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's how it's.
The State budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the agitated debate preceding the vote of the statement of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether or not, each chapter and article are the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is part of politics, although occulted behind the competition of power against government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is paid more attention in the media.
Politician disputes are much more interested in opinion than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not able to resolve at once:
The first is the important share of mandate costs imposed by law, not only constituted by retirements, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, the consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the biggest random.
This is public and relatively under control.
The true delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, debting their municipalities, to obtain, apart from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are based on this, it is found that:
Our economy has gone through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they ended the state increasingly.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that recurs primarily to previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programs that have unfortunately unnecessaryly swelled in the last few years.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures approved last year before the elections have been removed, if a change in the age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power will only be administered.
In little exaggerating, it can be said that politicians at power will become bureaucrats that mechanically distribute the majority of money imposed between retirement and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary expenses are deducted by mandate expenses.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments hadn't dissolved all the money they could.
If we do not really want politics in power to become simple bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it happens to take on taxes and tax rights, the calm needed to prepare new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed in monetary markets through auction.
It will be for banks to sell through an auction system the interest rates from which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion in auction and, moreover, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It was the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of Individual States decided to take a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major issues in the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl, Economic Outlook Group advisory group, wrote in his report to customers.
"The concerted action of Central Banks has decreased the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to approximately 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still follow," said Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“The situation seems to be really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensively to their customers.
This would decrease consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could influence economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after we failed to lower the interbanking rate in London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbanking market.
This means that banks were always afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English Central Banks have decreased their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a new decrease in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio, Tempus Consulting, told Reuters.
Some analytics do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not help confuse the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: Environmental debates are amazing
Global climate change is supposed to harm mostly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time the criticism shot down on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of the environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, replacement solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appeared in German translation, as he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions."
Now, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough arrangements to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academic capable of monitoring and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly evolving, therefore changes in it are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too significant nor too serious, therefore they are no danger and, finally, the efforts of climate in necessity to influence.
Especially because it has experienced a totalitarian regime, it considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions to others, which it feels as a dangerous harm to freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained repeatedly that it was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers expired the deadline and failed to renew their former driver’s license with validity expiring at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask for renewal, so that authorities are in the means of giving them a new license before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their driving license especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a decline in the number of license renewal applications, authorities in the capital are invaded of applications and the number of license renewal applications has increased this week.
The town happy about 2,000 customers a day.
There is a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issue of a new license takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who will not be able to make the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence will risk a fine as of January.
The guilty will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also handle the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine amounts to 2,500 crowns.
According to old information, it was likely to fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
Doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
But, according to spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver’s license is, according to him, a document that people can decide whether they wish to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that, it must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licenses.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old for the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police charged with David Berdych’s gang, will, respectively, be 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus condemned them definitively by reducing their penalties respectively by 1 years and by 2 years.
Originally, detectives of the Department for the fight against organized crime were at risk of sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment today, only a appeal to the Higher Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only waiting for the moment for the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, the amount of which exceeds 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people for participation in hold-ups, and today the Superior Court dealt with 16 appeals.
The majority of the accused had, since the beginning of the investigation, issued the accusation by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups, and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang had 30 percent of the lasting in Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation concerns the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed flights whose victims, in most cases, have suffered a serious harm to health, but also the abuse of power by a public officer and prohibited arms.
During home searches, the police found illegally held guns, buses with a steel core, a viewer for direct laser shooting or either a mitraillette.
According to the accusations, the gang has been enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already convicted of other hand-held fighting Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
At the moment, the main hearing has avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child Replacement Price: 12 Million
Igor Veleba, attorney of harmful families, wants to get a compensation of 12 million crowns and more expenses from the Třebíč Hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for parents and one million for each children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parents.
That is why the lawyer of Ondřej Dostál Hospital is absolutely unagreeing with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this is very high," Dostál said at the exit of the hearing.
“In order to be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report the opponent ordered the drafting.
We will check if this has any explanational value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital center in Prague-Motol, as a document to support negotiations on compensation.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been confronted with remorses of not having been able to prevent newborn substitution.
Women remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, the contents of the Veleba report summarised.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola in Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika in Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
Governor of Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave, in late October, 100,000 crowns to each of the families for the refund of expenditure caused by the mistake of the Třebíč Hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are forced by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of failure, they must draw from the reserve background, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka to lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand Valašské kralovství (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was in fact he who used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was developed by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present in today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his customer will appeal.
"The dispute relates to the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasiting on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valaško refer to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is the same opinion.
“There’s behind us a nearly ten-year work.
Looking for money and development of events," he said.
According to him, the money is the cause of dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and could benefit from it.
They’re the ones who want to parasit on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title Valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him in 1993.
But at the time, it had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of publishing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action initially, a business and a lucrative business activity came out, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské kralovství.
In 1997, Polívka agreed that his name and signature would be cited in the passport and even proposed balances to the holders on the price of his farm visit and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž show, for commercial purposes.
“Boleslav Polívka’s popularity certainly helped the Valašské království project,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was composed of Harabiš and his team that was intensely dedicated to the project.
Collaboration between the enemy parties today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official crown for Polívka at Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav's 1st elect forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under Harabiš's inspiration, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as a mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, calling for the court today to be rejected.
What could make the case clear is the envisaged tournament for the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to get a new king out of it.
He didn’t want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to work quickly.
It would be something like the kings' parade in Slovácco.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudice
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also manufacturing could, in many ways, be qualified as lower than average.
The Peugeot 207 is now on the market, which is significantly better.
The more than the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, of the space for the head on the back seats.
As the complaints are finished there because the combi carrosserie means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's quickly see done
I'm going to evoke the interior very quickly so I don't repeat too much.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have loved a little more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or files too short is over.
Side guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees disappear the lack of space above the already mentioned head.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing on this vehicle is its luggage support.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (also thanks to the pivoting rear ice) and a pretty easy arrangement.
The blind spaces are equipped with elastic stops which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not coarse and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop the volume.
According to the tables, it makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is relative to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most selling vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared to the next generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, it is found that the Peugeot remains very substantially behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a cart, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to bring out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low footstep.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the feeling of having an exhaust pot locked by a pin, then I can only be enthusiast.
Let's Browse the Rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, one must be aware that a car has been tested quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine of 329 900 Kč is still passed.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the count 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you'll get a very similar number.
There is nothing left but to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is wrong
The number of children from eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing remaining people concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin become violence.
The Northern Kent case, where the remaining and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin begin to be increasing, illustrates the problem of integrating children from eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and battles between students have transposed into parents' relationships.
The situation went so far that the police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with a iron bar.
The guilty defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist speech.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The young girls allegedly addressed this man racist remarks and threw stones to him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started screwing on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his ass," he described another unpleasant adventure from a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents has gone to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases testify that the atmosphere in British schools between residents of origin and immigrants begins to be tended.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are recorded in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a quiet sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or drunk cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
There is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described him as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and carried to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who made it build, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his customers was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, height buildings pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojimar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are always circulating in Havana, since formerly imported jigoulis and fiats have already long been in such a salt and wet, ruined climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decreeping, nowhere else in the surrounding area there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are.
Other places become more beautiful, for example, Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have pushed not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane was returned from extended plantations in sugarries on a narrow path by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades, so small locomotives whose contemporaries are elsewhere only in museums can be seen.
Where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Valley of Viňales west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in a candle from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile land being taken in their bowels, even its rocky rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where you probably grow Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You can encounter the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigarettes.
Someone may also find interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman has been shot.
Trinity
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
It is the market of the trade of slaves and that of sugar that brought glory and wealth to it.
The wealth has been incarnated in the beauty and wine-town character of this small city.
Koloniální Španělská architecture, vůrazně ovlivně pozdějími francouzskými osadníky, se za <0xC5><0xAC>tyři staletí téměř nezměníla.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous massive Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 50s of the last century there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone was just having a roof above the head.
If you have, in Trinidad, more time than one afternoon, then it is worth going to see interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it’s customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which rises after the sunset and where the music only snores in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located at the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo have to cross high, accidental mountains and cross a landscape almost without brands of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the Eastern Cuba square, thanks to its intact landscape, to the World Heritage List.
There is the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (really it has been born about a hundred years after the trip of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and current El Castillo hotel are seen several mountains table, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, mountainous massive Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Pirks and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about all this, a number of pages could be filled.
Only, as you say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary, according to the United States, influences the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO is expected to schedule a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it should, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing dispute of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops to be more activity this week through Defence Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development aid as a priority.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start their own new development of economy and security,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety-nine percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. Army data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent shares increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter in the southern part.
According to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of troops.
Concretely, they demand other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We must seriously think about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap of Hoop today held similar words.
“I’m not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
In the last few months, there are also conflicts between the countries involved concerning the question whether all allies actually do everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan faints discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document complemented by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild moved to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The charge of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is responsible for each Czech Republic.
In late September, the total debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better than expected economy in the state budget, the department has decreased the expected amount of 152.8 billion crowns.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it declined by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt of more than 84,000 crowns is responsible for each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it appears that thanks to a less deficit expected for next year, one could exceed the boundary of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that we have not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene appeared to change, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debt of the central government and is essentially caused by the accumulation of the deficits of the State budget.
State debt is funded by treasury bonds, income securities, direct borrowing or, for example, borrowing from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
State’s external debt has increased this year by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The debt of the state called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average State debt requirement was 6.5 years old.
“Total debt increased annually from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which is, given the current health of the economy, a very high number.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rental securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other side it indicates that there will be matter to negotiate when the retirement reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It resulted in the 2007 State Debt Funding and Management Strategy that the Government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, in early September, thanks to an evolving economies in the better than expected state budget, the department decreased the expected amount of 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly constituted by the State budget deficit, which will clearly reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
These are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the 10 billion pension reserve, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion crowns and the refund of borrowing from the European Investment Bank to 1.8 billion crowns.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for appointing a peluche bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving students aged 6-7 to give the name of Muhammad to a peluche bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished by whips.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attack on Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from student parents from the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the bear of the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as a favorite first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend “My name is Mohamed.”
The bear himself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting a religious faith, “I just regret that she had asked children to vote for a name,” it is only a “innocent mistake.”
Opinions shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Let’s remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it writes English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Highlighting that peace in the region was “in play,” his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“Violence is not anticipated immediately, but we enter into a very difficult period,” he added, so that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of the mediation on December 10
The mediators of the Troika, which groups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province of 90% Albano speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the continued negotiations beyond that date.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of U.S. administration in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it in a unilateral manner if the Security Council does not separate in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” Kosovo’s president, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the Baden hotel where these “last chance negotiations” have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, announced his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says to fear a domino effect in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, he said, it doesn’t mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
“Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” said Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word about the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made “in consultation” with the Westerns.
Bush draws an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference gathered by his care on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately engage in negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations in relation to the “roadsheet” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim to "conclude a peace treaty solving all suspended issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three spinal problems at the heart of the conflict between Israeli and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees chased from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations are “global and in-depth” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert committed himself to the upcoming talks to be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the current of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementation of its coexistent Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this sense of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, leads to a plan, endowed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the War of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because he is taking action on the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” says Prince Saudi in his interview with the Arabic-speaking daily Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police General Inspection (IGPN) survey, a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17:00 a.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawazaki, “not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “very vibrantly.”
“She hit the police car on his left, after a denial of priority on his right,” said a police officer.
Alcohol control of vehicle occupants was negative.
The state of the car (before shocked, star-run windshield, pushed shock) testifies the violence of the shock.
Quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced to have entrusted an investigation for “involuntary murder and non-personal assistance in danger” at the IGPN, co-asious with the Departmental Office of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGBP's investigation at this stage dismissed the responsibility of police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed “the version of the police, that this mini-moto came relatively quickly on their left.”
Yesterday, some sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained filled as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been captured and will be subject to technical expertise.
Bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have quickly left the places, thus not helping the two young people.
The NIGP, while remaining cautious, would also remove “all serious mistakes” in this matter.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which must be very cautious about,” a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of those few moments following the accident.
One of his windows looked precisely on the scene.
“We got down immediately, with my cousin who is nurse in the hospital, to try to rain them,” he says.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagard police officer, who was whipping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone.
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people in the unexpected situation of the youth, the police were taken by car by colleagues arrived at the site.
Always according to the witness, the help came “about twenty minutes after the police departure.”
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
“I won’t let me say that police services didn’t help young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistan’s police suppressed Monday’s first demonstrations since the emergency state was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the emergency state were injured by tear granates used by the law enforcement forces, witnesses said.
The latter responded by stone jets, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police have loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court bar lawyers called for general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent gathering.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers’ movement gathered Monday the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president urged the population to send flowers to judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and debris to those who lend oath to Musharraf.
"Musharraf's promise doesn't hold anymore"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
In the next few days, she had to decide on the legality of the reelection to the presidential on 6 October by indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evicted and replaced.
“Everything we assist is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s judgments,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president 'no longer' after the emergency state's establishment, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azem said Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed that January elections could be delayed.
Furthermore, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remains unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not planned, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Different contraception methods such as pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled a better "mastery of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women from 20 to 44 years of age has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight in ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the month nearly for a couple in five and if possible in the spring, season considered to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, essential to pursue the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, removal from habitable modules, how fast it was imagined, tools “brickled” by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded from Discovery’s shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece charged soon to welcome European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of adjustment for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was therefore to move an electricity production module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to post it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew started the redeployment of the module’s solar panels with a width of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which flows like concertons, was damaged near a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped in order not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to perform a check out of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the 30 meters of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very attractive, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician was therefore responsible for "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed kinds of "attles" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" stayed near the sas and, inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini insulating hockey channel wrapped to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricolled” by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in stock exchange
The EADS action is currently declining at the Paris exchange, after the aircraft and defence group announced it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its forecast of operational outcome for 2007 as a result of the slow progression in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of palling the delay taken in the delivery of its military transport plane, announced in October, amounted "between €1.2 and €1.4 billion including more than €1 billion for Airbus," the European manufacturer's mother house EADS said.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new Operational Result Objectives (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
In recall, the operational outcome of EADS dropped by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to loads related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the urns: the Russians will massively opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, or even to authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does it as the head of Russia’s united list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transpared by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely being charged with a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and wish honest, most transparent and most open elections, without an anguish,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She denounces a campaign with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there were “never such dirty elections, even at Eltsine’s time.”
Following the repression of last weekend demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians kept the Homo Sovieticus mentality”
Behind these legislatures without suspension, there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential round, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to become known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot break a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
What will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the powerful United Russian Party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and in the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they don’t feel masters of their fate,” said sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
Historian Nikolai Koposov, from St. Petersburg’s State University, delayed civil society in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin renewed with the model of a paternalist state, fully accepted by the population, especially as this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “will renounce personal responsibility” that they had briefly shown after the USSR’s breakdown.
“What is it good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, said: “What good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen’s Nazi archives, which trace the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far consultable only for a "humanitary" purpose, that is, in a individual and nominative manner, at the request of a former victim or his right owners.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will be able to conduct research “including the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Red Cross Committee (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Registers of Gestapo's concentration camps or arrest orders had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to mandatory work and, possibly, to provide proof of their internalization in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Antisemitism Research at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
The EU Foreign Affairs Ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements (LEAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth trade partner in the EU, according to the European Commission's figures.
“A free trade pact is doping the two economies a great deal” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million successful Europeans,” Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants Duros exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "the presence of eight billion euros of services," said the President of the European Commission, the president of New Delhi, Danièle Smadja, and president of the delegation of the European Commission to New Delhi.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday it was intended to lighten the current return of credit conditions concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual time.
"In order to relieve concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give the banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected income of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week market transaction."
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be marketed on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the basic rate and until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that BoE puts on the liquidity market at five weeks in an open market transaction.
These are normally done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its basic rate.
The daily interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were along with a significant penalty rate that had dissuaded banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, confirmed by the evolution of the book rate over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal for the socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken by the National PS Office on Tuesday including the increase of 50% of the employment premium, the recovery of the floating TIPP, a check-transport or the rent framework.
UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 vs. 115), the meeting was lifted after the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes vibrant, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the purchasing power.
PS Leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amendment bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is launched
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
“For our company, it’s an honour to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of the festivals in America,” Charlie Jones from C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic Director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the Reading Festival bar in the UK, which draws about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as “the most inspiring event” he ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn’s company work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked well with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in central Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are enlisted in political services because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Luckily, we’ve been able to talk with Melvin Benn and we’re preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that ultimately will serve the Philadelphia population.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after departing in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a fieldfield festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of the European and urban field festival to the American.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states “that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that, hopefully, will have a long lifetime.”
Charlie Jones says that the host capacity of this festival is “very big,” like that of 80,000 people from the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations were launched to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of pressing.
“Vineland will be a rock flavor, but the music will be varied in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
Not easy to attract Hollywood film plates in Montreal when none other than Terminator is opposed to it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to play in the “Governor” legs?
“We need to be cautious, it’s the industry who decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best,” he says.
The race at the festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oscar race is started.
It will be of all the festivals in the West Coast, whether it is the festival in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, matters of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them, and making sure the directors make interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in a scholarship? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
At less than five weeks of the closure of the year, investors already rub their hands by hoping the arrival of the traditional late-year rally.
This year, however, experts are not as certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from the statistical perspective, the month of December on a scholarship generally has positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, market uncertainties, at least in the short term, are watching."
Although they are not supportive for the stock exchange to take on in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds thanks to the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage to quality values in both long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not volatility-free "especially because it is not known the impact of the likely decline in the Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“This is not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Spanish Stock Exchange Index, Ibex, lost nearly 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative vision.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur each year during these dates.
However, the expert shades that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitutional Feast (December 6).
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to the technical levels and “this is why we could see a rebound of the index that could be caused based on the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum covers.
Solana, from Intermoney, said that “this year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include the two large banks and a few manufacturers in the portfolio “because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive.”
While Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event that they are going to do so.
“ACS has regained positions for several months and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a bass month.
The authentic late-year rally took place in 2003, the year during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the perception of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
We will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeded in computer on its late-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renew much of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of Spanish agencies, since it was the first group that decided to start wagering on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 20:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reitered several times that he would like to amplify the schedule of his branches, BBVA, even though he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon but not to the public.
The results of the Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other agencies to adhere to or not to this initiative that coincides with the business schedules.
This is precisely the goal that the Popular Bank seeks.
Attract autonomous customers who travel through these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but the renovation of those already existing.
For this, the organization will modernize its branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers in different streets.
In this way, time amplification is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The trade manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not imply large investments, but hiring staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the Murillo Brave streets, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very extensive schedules, which even open on Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero notes.
For the moment, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser at Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the closure of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tendered his joy: "What hurts me is not that we have increased more, but that we have dropped less," he said.
However, he put emphasis on the fact that in a small market, 'we've fell less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54 percent.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66 per cent for a year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% in addition) thus reached €4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, which has given up yesterday 1.52 percent and accumulates a decline of 40.5 percent since January, cost half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other exchange-listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we profit it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the advisor delegated at Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising group.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in 2006 for the current year.
Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while television net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors announced by the analysts for Telecinco’s best relative evolution in Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give for at least 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market presents signs of fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antenna gains from 3 to 4.5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
The Ibersecurities company recommends purchasing both values based on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulation) better than the Antenna 3 (maintained) for 'multiple attractions ' and increased business.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends that both cases be considered because it had similar threats (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which today ended with the vote of the Congress of Amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to public hearings the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and endorse the best regulations able to guarantee the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of agencies to ensure that markets work effectively.
The Mifid, which changes the Value Market Act, involves modernization of financial markets, while it strengthens the protection of investors, improves the powers of leaders of the National Value Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultation services for both specialized social reasons and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ISIS), financial consultation companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
Furthermore, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current scholarship managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management on the market and obliges them to keep a register of all their operations, to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
Throughout the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that securitised debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, which has demonstrated with what happened with the high-risk American hypothecal debt (subprime).
Furthermore, they benefited from the transposition of the management benefited to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics may be 30 years after approved in 1977, the royal decree that delimits the occupational functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require authorization from the CNMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing and attraction services for new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The Harmonised Consumer Price Index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which afterwards serves Eurostat to incorporate it to the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price changes in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing comparable data in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be disclosed on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economic Minister Pedro Solbes said the increase of 4.1% in the IPC in November is a "time number", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the Congress’s corridors that “although the figure is not good” Spain’s inflation difference on the monetary union continues to be “more or less” the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November there was "less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We hoped for a figure of about 4%," the Minister of Economics said in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover €42,000 over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits dropped to more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered a crisis in the middle of September and had to use an emergency credit from the bank of England.
At this time, he gathered some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a number that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of its customers’ distrust and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its Virgin Money trademark, needs to catch around a quarter of the income of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of the 30,000 million.
The magnat group Richard Branson, known for its campaign to create advertisers in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the Virgin Association’s offer, in which three other companies are involved, including his favorite to save him from the bankroad.
Mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (the People’s Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption frame discovered this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the memo of last May, Juan Morales, current member of the right, and until then a municipal counsel of the town hall, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'menor' of this framework.
The officers continue to search the municipal and the board of Urbanism and the possibility of new arrests in the coming hours is not discontinued.
Furthermore, Juan Morales’ lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption frame, discovered early this week, was imputated.
As said yesterday the Chain SER at the attorney of MP's 'Popular Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession regarding the frame.
Furthermore, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged income of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalified 200 hectares of field.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be head of the Spanish Socialist Party’s nomination for Toledo and to chair Congress if they win the elections
Former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer by President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
The Spanish Socialist Party’s organizational secretary José Blanco and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because “it’s important to rely on the best” in political life and Bono “is among the best.”
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will chair the Congress if the socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to attend the next general elections and abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting to return to the political avant-garde since he abandoned him two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the vice-president of economics if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will chair the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reached the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or crying" and make it "becoming more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate in some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge to do" and didn't want to do as if he already occupied his position to not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents could consider as "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Because the movement against climate change is subject to unmerciful persecution, both the skepticals of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even plans to sign a “new contract for the planet.”
This approach requires him to explain why the action or inaction of its Government has in a decisive way contributed to Spain to the head of the European Union in the non-enforcement of Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Furthermore, he must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to break climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, and what economic consequences this will cause.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Costful, uncomfortable and threatening to business and individual accounts.
Up to the 100th of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, it seemed readingly so dangerous to Zapatero that he denied it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequences.
With sentences that have the impact, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for the electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and does not require, beautify meetings and inspire tenderness.
Assuming that this is only a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and Head of Totana Police arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murchian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of local police, the town hall secretary and a suspected hotel entrepreneur for possible urban offences, today reported sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at the moment numerous agents met, who also attended the municipal councillor office of the Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial Soil and the Accommodation.
These three stops are added to the six stops held last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
Furthermore, two other persons were not arrested, but they are imputated in the judicial investigation, which was instructed by the Court of Justice No. 1 in Totana.
The first six detainees today have passed to a judicial provision.
According to sources, the previous Totana municipal counselor and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
Furthermore, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current fiancé of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán, Pontevedra, as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Inmonuar Suelo, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the winning pots would have been realized.
The investigation is responsible for the UCO of the gendarmerie's Group of Urban Crimes whose officers, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven inspections, most of them in detainees-related companies in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas, Totana.
Only one person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have played the role as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would assume to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which focus on the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the Vigo parkings in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which focuses on the direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, and selling.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime passible from a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (section 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the penalty imposed for downloading (section 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (section 154 of the Criminal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorization from the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: "Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less."
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest Science number.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the neurocognition images group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded properly and his companion failed.”
The researchers noticed that when the two people guessed they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkan Attorney
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has implacablely pursued Balkan war criminals since the public prosecution of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Tribunal, which is located in the Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with bitter taste, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbobonian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on this list with the documentary of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'the Carla list' (2006, not exclusively projected in Spain), with the pace of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who pursues the leaked criminals and pressures on the governments involved to re-relate.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of potentially harmful, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, driver’s license, civil status, vehicle type, or use, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is that choosing the appropriate car insurance is even harder than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the granted premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of a sinister.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, gender, driver’s license, civil status, type of vehicle to be secured or the use that is actually used, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of suffering from an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of sinisters than at their caution.
Similarly, by using census companies concluded that married people tend to have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account at the time of establishing the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation in order to choose the auto insurance that best adapts to his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing any type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when paying a contract with an insurance at an accessible price, such as the low driving experience and the ancientity of the driving licence.
Although the ideal to be insured is insurance at all risks, there are other more economical options.
The most prospective drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with freedom, so that they get the covers of an insurance at all risks but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the sinister.
“The portion of the amount of the sinister that the customer will be paid will be established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be low,” says Luis Noguera, the official in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is expanded third-party insurance, so that the customer guarantees protection to address damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are 25-year-old try to be cautious and avoid sinisters as far as possible, since this will affect bonuses, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
“Bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to allow itself to increase the bonuses," Noguera said.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when they make a contract with an insurance, as the rate of sinisters is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is best to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
“Normally young people cannot enjoy the experience earlier acquired after an accident,” said the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the novice has passed.
However, if the customer is married but does not yet have children, it is better that he negotiate an insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be people with the lowest rate of sinisters, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance at any risk with freedom (may be €300), or an expanded third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle’s life when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more relaxed drive and they have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to take over a larger amount of franchises,” Luis Noguera said.
For retirees, an insurance at all risks with freedom is preferable (which is €150), or an expanded third party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of potential harmful, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, that is why it is essential to study the insurance that is most appropriate for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow will be measured next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be first and Scottish to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified themselves during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not pass ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as the Milan AC must play the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at their home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk won't, but it won't be able to compute it only because with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milans will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have a good hope to rank for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition with a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
In waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the triumph would only come back to Shakhtar, in the event that the Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth finals in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Vancouver’s first Spice Girls tour concert
The Spice Girls initiated in Vancouver, Canada, with about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) reported that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video told the story of the group that made fury in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincides with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls climbed on stage showing the bracelets that Posh Spice spouse had offered to them, British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham said that the British football player “has not seen our costumes so I’m nervous because I don’t know what he’s going to think about the show.”
'Sporty Spice' who was part of the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" and caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the show started.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm happy to make a decision," Chisholm said on the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that with time, “things have been arranged and we appreciate ourselves very much.”
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls were exhibited for the last time in 1998.
According to CTV, the band arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitting army waited for them.
They have five sons seven.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California, San José (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine throws alarm.
A dispute on the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most of Russian gas exports to the European Union are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipe is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian ownership monopoly company supplying gas, have tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would rise as expected, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbor Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve for Ukraine, a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, reminding that we are a country through which most gas transits," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“Fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (towards Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in the drop in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest stocks of gas, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completed its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “should control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra community employees to check whether they have previous criminal criminals, the supervisory committee said.
The warning of the General Revisor, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern about the fact that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Its report still highlighted other decisive checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The General Reviewer has controlled the extra community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Adullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was part of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October because he was suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to perform previous criminal controls, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the reviser's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Preceding Criminal Control, allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
“Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been verified well, this is not done every time,” the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
BMA Chairman Peter Terry said it is “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment controls can identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks currently operate well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities declared employment of 1161 overseas people, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
But the general reviewer stressed that these figures must certainly be revised up, in part due to the issues relating to identifying members of employees equipped with untermined contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The survey showed that current health authorities control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is revising its policy and pre-employment control system for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensure a better implementation of recently updated pre-employment checks and valid for all employees, including overseas people.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the pic bio on the last singer of Joy Division, Ian Curts, won five awards, including the best film, at the Oscars of British Independent Film.

The black and white film whose musical band was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, better known for his iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, won two awards, the first as best scene director and the second as best beginner scene director.
The Rock was also awarded with the Best Documentary Award attributed to Julien Temple’s film on the singer of the Clash, Joe Strummer.
The award for the best actor was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, famous for his coriate character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The fifty-year filmmaker, having filmed films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award in honor of the star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris well twice.”
“I was admirable to this great current actor, I was extremely honoured.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stage directors, actors and festival organizers.
Among Bifa’s fans and bosses are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia revealed that it has arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells managing an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the missile smuggler cells.
Al Qaeda’s supporters have set a campaign against the Allied Monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV journal said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military to protect the sites, following a failed attack from Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement from the Minister of Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the prisoners seem to have plotted the assassination of churchmen and armed forces.
The government asked churches to do more against the Saudi leaders in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda activists fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered heretic according to the hard line of Sunny Saudiers.
Al-Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiasticists have collaborated with authorities to support the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi Al Qaeda of origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five... months,” said the spokesman of the Interior Minister on state television.
Among the detainees, 16 Medine members organized in a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thinking,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and post-Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing activists.
Venus’ climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European orbiting vessel have shown that the planet is certainly twice smaller than the Earth, unlike what we thought before.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost of the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth, and may have even been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation alloys to a slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a hot enough temperature surface to melt the lead there.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of the physics department of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth, although the planets in themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have originally been the same as Earth, can be even with a habitable surface.”
The uranium enriched was kidnapped by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One policeman said three people have been arrested and the equipment is currently analyzed.
He didn’t confirm that it’s uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wouldn’t meet as a presidential candidate, to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, the Republican candidates for the presidency finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who recorded their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as that from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, questions and answers have greatly reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate for next elections.
We don’t know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube’s clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-to-one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The rule raised approval increases when candidates speaked grossly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney who is head of the major anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his New York Mayor mandate.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked whether they would be ready to promote "amnesia" (offering regular status to clandestines and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be thanks to the fact that they began fighting immigration before and in a more incisive manner than others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: rigid borders, and zero tolerance for clandestine immigrants.
This subject, allied with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the external world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for weapons control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether candidates believed in their whole Bible content.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about to believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee - in the pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he began to laugh and said that Jesus is too chic to come to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's resurrection in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious subsidies research carried out by Libertarian Ron Paul, and the sifflings during the Wednesday debate.
These two emerge from the nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected party cannot agree to decide who is the most known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the American magnitude that brings the leaders closer.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The pains of the workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to fall; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra sucked married foot finger.
But here is a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have stated: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back in his election project, stupidly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped on the contrary to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a failure of guidelines and a poor judgment in emergency cases.
Inadequate proposals for the change in the tax code have caused a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At the moment, the suspicion of loud donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourists (and his former chief of vigilance) have made them to have resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is unmissable towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t love politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things or even govern for a long time when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the ministers’ cabinets do the balance; the press seeks bad stories; and the government becomes on defensive and without any further objectives.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he wishes to reject Tony Blair, he was nevertheless his senior lieutenant.
The issues related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions taken when he was a chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even though he is not directly involved in Blair’s disasters, such as the long investigation of the party’s funds “money counting for members of the Lords Chamber,” voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that it looks like it.
The gaps are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories Party make it believe.
Like Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to concretize Mr. Brown's Stalinian trends of always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he would not wish any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of major subsidiers of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who declared to be aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be asked, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsible for grant collections who spoke of doubtful donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing leaves believing he had been aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made after his arrival in June to the government.
So far, the Prime Minister made half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using an investigative committee on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been deceived, it's the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on financial political parties.
This would force the Labour Party to work with the Tories in a weak moment, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some supporting facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it is two years old to reconquer the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate unclearly integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see attracted swimsuits, turbine around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market goes through a critical phase, predators target the U.S. credit cards market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of cardholders.
It’s too early to panic.
Fees and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point below its historical average.
Rate deterioration is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. laws in 2005 relating to personal bankrott caused an abrupt drop in bankrott archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions should worsen.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt sum consumers need to pay.
and the confidence in the safety of credit cards capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 emission volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might rather increase their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But cards issuers are more attentive to the flow of cash rather than the value of heritage, and therefore the drop in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to changes in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of borrowing; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the entirety.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowing,” said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a substantial decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the back swimming pools.
British bankers complain guilty of the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to witness their roles in relation to fraud committed by Enron’s previous Financial Director Andrew Fastow changed their statement, complaining for guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged fraud charges in 2000 committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud to get rich despite their employees.
They should be present in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared guilty of committing fraud.
The three former Greenwich NatWest managers, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC Group, have become famous all over Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a matter of suspension for this investigation launched after Enron’s fall in 2001.
The accusations inflicted in 2002 made Fastow know that it was the subject of the government’s investigation in Enron’s debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, called the "three of Natwest" declared they came to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled partner of Enron, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trick banking procedures.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary’s bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow would falsely announce to Enron that the energy company would have to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But really these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow suffers a six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million deposit each, which forces them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, a previously seventh largest national company, bankrotted in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its cost-effective speculation.
The collapse caused thousands of resignations, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offences were vanished because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having a sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without stages from Moscow to Los Angeles, share of $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
“He can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs so much seats because it’s more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a society.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Salon of the Millionaires, a consumer incentive orgy, for four days, held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to raise the interest of the new wealthy Russians for their various products, ranging from yachts in acache to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked at a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
“Thanks to a boom of oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas.”
“We lived the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so wealthy and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Department of Russian and Eurasian studies Davis at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabia in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the largest worldwide spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH President, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
Furthermore, two-thirds of the wealthy are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists from the Economic and Financial Research Center.
(World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived under the poverty threshold).
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jewelrymaker.
She attended the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Jeutier Group de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the lounge Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-seam dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The lounge seems primarily to target the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the tail in the caps to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice, custom billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gpell bears are exhibited.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Delf Dutch porcelain manufacturing factory stand, in front of a wall picture of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
“It’s certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, sellers here said that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years of age are too much according to Russian standards) have already switched from brilliant logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold in the lounge.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires, or tourists, arpent the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil, said he sold two sets of silk mattress, cashmere, and cotton embedded with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 motorcycle sales manager, a company that equips cars with latest crying alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, L.A. Connection’s president Andrei Karapetian, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals so that it looks like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term “Russian millionnaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, unless in cash,” he said.
“There’s more you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the Continental Alliance stand, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing British phone cabins, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team has printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire trade fair.
Passengers arrested to launch masses of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or stabbing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's day before Ronald Livingston watched the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and watched an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stopped,” Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman Olga Arroyo, assistant director of Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, resides at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confident waiting for the results of toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take a long time, but that should allow to resolve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Miss Arroyo was the assistant of police director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and his voice was well-known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious,” McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“It was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Miss Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who was working for the Alcohol Drink Control Commission, and leaving two sons of 14 and 11 years old, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
The authorities said they arrived at her house at approximately 5 p.m.
and have found Melle Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh was unable to confirm whether Miss Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether some of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Miss Castro where a faned rose lies in the narrow front cemetery, and a Dalmatian boiled on the back.
A blue bead called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and perfumes, was sitting in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two field bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo was extremely valuable, helping her to navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about this,’ he said.
“She was there when I came, and still when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rates related to the effervescence of the global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently reducing interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, #2, after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their shares in agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has in part “inverted some improvements in the operation of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this hard turbulence had to persist, it would increase the probability of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further decreased interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These comments also allowed to calm Wall Street with even worse news on the US economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial tumultuation were accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announced that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to losing real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are scheduled in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, which is 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, i.e. 2.7% concluding at 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax Index increased 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased 2.3%.
Previously, the resurrection of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted as a result of the high demand for a monthly auction of three-month funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European trade banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to track the EFD and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets causing credit tensions has caused the monthly Libor borrowing rates of British banks to cause their highest growth since September, to 6.59% followed a strong rise since November 12.
England faces a judgment appeal with respect to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the batter #6 for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more importantly in a context as broad as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second issue is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, coach chief, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Chief Executive Officer of England, begins to fill the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
Anyone who won't win the 6th back will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfortunate.
It is never easy to eliminate what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of enabled.
There is not only in the cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end the judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"; both, new executives who have earned good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless it is given at least one chance?
The figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye, at the same time he must catch the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors in 33 rounds to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to still offer.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, this is just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successfully succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricketer of the test, and that despite the fact that his double hundred mark against Australia can still be estimated under.
The likelihood predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah’s greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the innings of the 88 Test in Mumbai, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious leaks in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scared him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England sponsor.
He deferred only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from a distance, to ask him “he had seen this?”
Bopara is far the best struggler, his filant look allows him to do services that go to him, and he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the true art of selection?
I would be favorable to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah shouldn’t apply if, as the tea leaves suggest it, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work and fight against al-Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spreading out those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normality.
Some came back to fight against the activists who removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government bus, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who have returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now.”
“They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed his men to move away for the moment.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors of Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-held militia has allowed Al-Qaeda to hunt from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he encouraged citizens to rebell against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m home today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since the US troops arrived, and the view of continuous formation of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have escaped past years.
51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all about exile visas that Prime Minister Shia Nuri al-Maliki, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have escaped the country because of the sectarian escadrons of death.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encourages the government to no longer give visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni pensioner said.
“I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunni were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is worried that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fights.
Small Saar, good training.
The smallest Federated State leads vocational training, and shines even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
Only in a field weighs a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not the French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-derision, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This shows the high amount of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
In addition, it also leads the children of the country to higher schools in a number higher than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
“In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW training expert.
More than one in five youngsters receives their degree in a professional school, thus Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has decreased by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of Sarois forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineer science matters.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of childcare is law-free - a model that in the meantime copy from other federal states as well.
Only future comparison studies will show whether student performance improves sustainablely.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of risky students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are going better.
And despite the greatest Sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if sarrois are not French.
Chavez regulates the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tick-tack other than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will bring the timeline back to the South American country for half an hour.
Chavez became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chavez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States had imposed the world’s separation of time zones in full hours.
Furthermore, Chavez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain President of Colombia, he would not have any relationships with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, waiting for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw in Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "swept in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chavez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain, also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new cell phone sound is furious in the country: "Why don't you calm" (why don't you calm) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellation of left-wing populists and told him to silence.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to a forecast, a real less-value wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts cited all kinds of reasons to explain their forecast pessimist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their pay sheet compared to the previous year in 2007.
“The fault is the low wage development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research to the newspaper Bild.
New charges could also occur in employee unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected decline in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in embarrassment to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines to poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today brought evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus burst at a height of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning would have caused life to appear on Earth: storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a cornerstone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there was life, it must have been on a very ancient date of history," explains Sean Solomon from the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be little living things today on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are 500 degrees of temperature.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal twin of Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which resembles Earth so much in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in venus research, since no longer had been on the road to explore this planet since the ninety-nine years.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than supposed in the first place.
Thus, the researchers found, besides the wind turbines already known at the northern pole, a turbine of clouds at the southern pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the land hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called evening or morning star turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: one Venetian day lasts 243 earthly days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, barely recalls the Earth, scientists assumes that the two planets have formed themselves under similar conditions.
On both, water has accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide has attached to Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus the largest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the dispute of the parties about the welcome of Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summed up the great coalition to close the dispute about the welcome of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divided nation on this issue to the outside world," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed the understanding for the welcome of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even though I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but Merkel defended against the reproach that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional policy of a single China.
"China knows it too," said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly announced his dissatisfaction about the welcome of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, of the CDU’s “foreign policy” in the field of foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellor, virulent irritation was made in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only decommanded the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the Spiegel's information, also frozen the said dialogue on the strategy of both countries' foreign ministers.
Chief of China’s government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the welcome of Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in its official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that he attempts to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out on the streets by violence, the German Minister of Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, crackers shooting on the police with hunting guns: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosive doesn't constitute in ourselves as well and disappears in violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he said at the New Press published in Hannover.
All young individuals would not be able to get out of it with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the municipalities had already worked firmly to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to Islam conferences, this already shows its first success."
However, it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German outskirts, there are no sociological problems or from the perspective of urbanism as in France.
In the Northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had brought themselves into serious street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse also, cars and public buildings have burned.
Further efforts to integrate the German government required the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
However, it would remain a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployed quota among young people below 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
More places for training should be secured first and foremost.
Kolat insisted, “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families was more placed in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we must still be cautious."
It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities in post reported three arrests as well as a few cars and burned waste.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disorders were overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the prosecution, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's utopic stage entry shows that the coalition ended with the background - and there's nothing to expect from her.
Which country does this Chancellor live rightly?
After his desolar intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of too much focusing on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel of a tough and presumptuous phrase.
It is provincial, she said and only hence showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a weighty politician, who flies into foreign policy and even there remains in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this matter it again and again welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having so little modestness, the head of the CDU would have refused it yet two years ago.
Now it cramps into all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
It destroys her image of pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Empire of the Angela Cloud, the problems of internal politics are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few sentences left for that.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times when it laps when it comes to family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-accurate sentence.
It is in unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The branch Attack
In the YouTube debate of Republican candidates to the presidential, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard-offensive battle - and now must be afraid of an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already broke out on the first topic.
He would have made New York a “clandestine refuge,” reproached Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house was a clandestine house," Giuliani answers and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts for employing paperless immigrants.
Candidates are going to the attack: since the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taken the lesson vigorously by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg joint hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented or future tax increases are denied, applauses defer into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney explains and apologizes to the base and television audience for having still been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian.
One day after his withdrawal as army chief, the Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of army domination ended.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistan’s television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he passed his office as army chief to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus folded himself to the international pressure, especially that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a blood-free putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as a head of civilian state.
Through this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state Musharraf decreed on November 3.
Soon after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the emergency state, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fulfil another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the emergency state with its ranks lawyers, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October.
Five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s replayed: the three members of the Harmonia Group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were published.
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left of 57-year-old Michael Rother and owned a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, among others even a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to be too disturbing the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again ensured a few emotions among the lovers of Krautrock.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted surveys reveal that, although the name is reasoned in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as lasting so that this group has also been lacking painfully for 32 years.
But why didn’t German have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially because what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more likely in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry in 2003 awarded the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panoramic praise, the surprise had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during that period the impact power that felt was much lower than that which was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly destroyed Kraftwerk and eventually made himself a name as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forets.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Komune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
In the garbage there was a fan of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because as silent and little as music sounded, the band suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve himself alone in search of self.
The "Live 1974" CD that has recently appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother lands into the spheres of esoterism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herz" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanimates in the 1990s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the Live album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set the aim of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried at this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of the Krautrock would be covered with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase plans in the room in the middle of the unique sounds: “The only true music you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazar-wired tools serve for the formation of the legend.
Ahead, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments of unhearted sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three in great technical fignolers.
The house's choir will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we're mouth and snugged under the cloud of sounds, and we're singing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaaaaaaa" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never worked as a rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leakage of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts “68” is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer angry with it.
But what goes most of self will be covered carefully on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can tap on someone’s nerves (?) or give away moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn’t cynical enough.
With “The Hunting Party” and “Deadly Peace,” two films are once again approaching the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either projects are too based on action and nonsense shooting exchanges or, on the contrary, they are too larming.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good news first: although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the Balkan mountains, it is just there, in the most lughy background of the Bosnia War, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We finally lost sight the most beautiful man of the eighty years, because many too much kind and futile roles in women's feeling movies and too many press conferences on Buddhism were pleased to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch yet "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's movies should be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a beautiful representation full of clins of eyes: at the bottom, his war-reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry weren’t as charming: a man who has long been behind his best moments, but who, even as a ruined monument at his decline, kept visible remains of his ancient charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with German production "Deadly Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up of missing films on the Balkan War.
The movie speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovo free shooters, in which one of the two falls still in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evil, this movie as flat as a television movie loses too quickly in the action and exchange of foolish shootings.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without the highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the asshole", may have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories resemble themselves strikingly: two males go in a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for The Hunting Party’s failure is that we simply don’t let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world’s premium hunters failed to succeed in five years: seize the war criminal and leave him for a fair revenge to Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court of Crime against film logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive hunting quite intensely due to secret political agreements.
But the intentional good and the evil are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea of us.
He speaks of a wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the front inflated, clearly: how tiring it is to be evil."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa yet.
What’s worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis house or a mine field, he then comes out something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond Going Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can shoot a good film on the Holocaust with "The List of Schindler".
Some movies must still mature - those that today are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been unanimously celebrated at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also simply know too much about the conflicts of the world today, where every hecatom comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this is happy to the scriptwriters the lack of scrupulos they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Dictator" have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Perhaps you shouldn’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novel Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he answered: "It is only due to the fact that some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be killed in a horrible way and war will always rule in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has raised criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The retreat of the mayor with Hamburg's nomination for the Olympic Summer Games has grown to critical politics and economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the edge of the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described an abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, political-sports could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"This is not Hamburg who decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told World Online.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December on the Munich application for the winter games of 2018.
This preference means for us that in the time we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not permanently belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would be the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, buriing the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the nomination would be more in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the hosting in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have called the Hamburg candidate to the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in building housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics map and excluded housing construction,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast delegates of the SPD.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Little Grasbrook a plan integrated in the Olympics and the subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have been exclusively on the "Event factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics candidacy would have raised a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
He who connects the concepts of Sweden and wood box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or so?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
Much of the ninety Brillo boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" market has questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm leads to a desenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" and the former director of the Ponta Hulten Museum in 1995.
Ancient history is filled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wood boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of powdered soap boxes "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been directly delivered from the Brillo cardboarding factory.
These were not works of art, but rather models of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given the authorization in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak about fifteen wooden boxes that would at the time enter law into the history of art and auction, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol allowed, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached in auction over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum alleged, incorrectly, that later about one hundred wooden boxes were produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservative at Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, including two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and dug, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating from the 1990s reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background laminated panels, using a paint roll - in addition it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol," says director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' collection in New York does not come another decision as the Moderna and its six-class Musea.
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "words" accusations that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then we have been aware of an inexorable silence there.
Rebel Soldiers of Manila abandoned
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same soldiers who had cut off in a hotel in Manila, and who had required the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he cannot respond to any blood emissions.
The power-faithful soldiers had taken the hotel shortly before assault using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been cut off in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a missing attempt to putch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He benefited from the hearing to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathetics.
The military policemen, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Power-loyal troops close the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chairperson convened an urgent meeting of the Cabinet of Security.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.

United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet provided more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.

The two companies founded the MSP participation company to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the moment, the two companies want to estimate themselves satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet trusted Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all the options open, particularly to increase participation in Freenet SA, it was learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker still hardly predictable on Freenet, which has last for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.

It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent additional.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
