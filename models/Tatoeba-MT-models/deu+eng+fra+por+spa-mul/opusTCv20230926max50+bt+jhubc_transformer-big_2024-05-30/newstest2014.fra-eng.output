Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingswear (a combination of wings), it moved to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters high, where many badoods had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have trouble finding the money needed to repair the decrepit highway infrastructure, many are those who enter into a solution in the form of a small black box that fastens above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record all the miles driven by a driver and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to remember the obsolete funding system of major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of major axis planning suddenly caused strong debate and movemental alliances.
The Libertarians joined environmental groups to pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and eventually the road you’re traveling, then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about privacy protection.
While the members of the Congress are unable to agree to see whether it should be continued, several states have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system allowing drivers to pay depending on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of drivers have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It’s not as if we had the choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Chief Executive Officer of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to start recording the miles driven by each Californian driver by 2025.
There will be change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do so.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes that Americans pay on the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans are not buying as much petrol as before.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile-to-mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the long-term most logical alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the seduced idea of citizen liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in a way that allows for example to reduce gaseous emissions and gaseous emissions.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in state ambitious global warming laws.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House of Representatives' Transport Committee, said he also considered him as the long-term most viable alternative.
The free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers on the mile.
“This is not just a tax engaging in a large black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transport which, in a 2011 report, urged the Congress to go on the path of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the Chamber's presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles daily to go to their work or city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities make progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country’s most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay to the state kilometer fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 road transport agencies in States along the eastern coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smallest facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and these kinds of things are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its site: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-placed devices.”
It is not necessary to build a huge and compelling technology infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep the records of people’s daily venues and venues.
Nevada is one of the few states now running to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car drives, but without knowing exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes to the states.
She tried to drive into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay depending on their mileage.
But the devices it tests liked large axes planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded per modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, True Mileage CEO.
Great mistakes have been made in the pilot programs of certain States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners are trying to experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any device at all, preferring to pay a package based on the average number of miles passed by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to mistrust citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport managers seek to develop a tax device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid embossing.
“Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages that the system offers them,” a document on urban design said.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the entire debate on mile payment is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, officials say the Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gasoline taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of petrol, so each pays its right share.
“It’s not necessary to use radical surgery when simply aspirin is needed,” said Randy Rentschler, director of law and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four news in listening
The English musician hasn’t finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he conceived a luxury re-edition scheduled for November 4, with several news.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date of 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to make the pop scene spark.
A feast for fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to reedit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This re-edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three records: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the records, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, most importantly, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a well-mastered rock electricity.
Unreleased already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrying intro before a light cavalry that gradually slows down to leave space to a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this played title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enthusiastic, make a desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie has any fun playing the cameleon with these titles: informator tour, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He dissimulates and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No surprise that he has a mask at hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation à la Voyage, of the brand Louis Vuitton, of which he incarnates the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they return to civil life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the army members were following a transitional plan in collaboration with their seniors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them is released until they are ready, he said.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military people - who do not meet the rule of the "universal service" of the army demanding staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Captain David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, has been released from the army despite his request to stay a year more so that he can receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Captain Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I was not ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army is hard to determine what latitude it can grant to injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not capable of fighting.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the duration of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday the reintegration of Captain Hawkins, while Neo-Democratic Jack Harris claimed the immediate end of "this shameful practical."
Disney puts on tablets to launch an animated series
The U.S. media and entertainment band Disney has decided to prioritize the tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children’s series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets on November 24.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group’s channels is expected until 2014, the Disney Junior division reported.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the puppy Callie, sheriff of a city in the western American where she rules the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience enters Disney’s efforts to “expand the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published early week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of young children under 2 years have already served a tablet or phone, and 72% of young people under 8 years, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence reporter, said he was willing to go to Berlin to witness to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he benefits from the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relationships between the United States and Germany were made tough test as a result of complaints that the NSA had pushed out the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Mr. Ströbele, German Green Member, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA consultant’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden was witnessing in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the member said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
He said, however, that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world and senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter provides an offer for cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers might have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video on request via their television in a future that doesn’t seem so far.
Cogeco’s subsidiary reported Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said.
Cogeco Cable thus boxes the step to its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco’s subsidiary has not yet a precise date regarding this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers currently don’t have access.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
The Cogeco and Cogeco Cable p.g. also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television suppliers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the services à la carte.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn't work," Audet said.
He hopes however that the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) consultations will lead to interesting recommendations.
"He will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy regarding television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has conducted consultations with the public since last week and it is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported to have recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 <0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs linked to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for a sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they have grown 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, in decrease compared to 45.7 million, or 93 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about how many customers fluctuate this way.
For me, this is not the indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from a quarter to a quarter with a very strong competition.
From horse in beef products
Horse meat has been discovered in container boxes of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-price distribution signs, the food hygiene agency today announced.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at 1 to 5%.
“As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been present in the product,” the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe early this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission’s reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles made four injured early Friday on road 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 p.m., a driver who traveled north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic returned to normal around 6 p.m., Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, she indicated that passengers could take the unopen can with them at the plane’s descent.
The new hand luggage costs relate to the bags ranked in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers only pay once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she explained.
The airlines started paying the first and second luggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these fees put as many things as they could in hand luggage ranked in the upper compartments, so there was often no space in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees will not really use to collect money.
It is about making the most faithful customers of Frontier understand that it becomes increasingly difficult to find place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket from the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tail at a Frontier boarding door might carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these fees before reaching the door.
Frontier's hand luggage fees will not be applied before summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often spend about luggage fees and other costs, but airlines love them.
They believe that luggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street consider adding luggage fees as a sign proving that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of the air trip after years of losses.
However, many of them have not affected luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines manager, recently traveled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door at the time that passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage costs imposed by the company.
“I have never seen such a smooth embarking procedure from my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth scratches and a fight burst at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "Passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning."
Frontier also does as Spirit and applies $2 fees for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways tried briefly to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to pay hand luggage fees when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Expedia $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half miles of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the miles bonuses by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000 miles Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer in his origin city, Denver, but his activity goes back and she loses money.
Revenues declined by 9% and its flight capacity declined by nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by its mother company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to redress Frontier’s finances by selling the airline.
NSA challenges “internal mistake” rather than computer hackers for website failure
The National Security Agency, working in the shadow, said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the crash of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the espionage agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA website had been off for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA’s website’s failure by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system.
The NSA formerly ultra-secret, a time called the No Such Agency, has been under the fire of projectors and heavily criticized over the past months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and abroad communications surveillance programs – which are part of the NSA secret files stolen to the agency and disclosed by the former consultant NSA.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Center City is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to leave employees off.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, we met individually with employees to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very ferocious, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
“Either he sold it to someone else and that’s what happened,” explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for older people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be held in two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to be closed, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, today declares ready to save 333 jobs on the 137 that the factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, 21 October.
After renounced the plant's purchase project in January, you're returning today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" trade unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this back-face.
Is it to enjoy Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries France works eight hours with disabilities.
In India, China and many other countries, we work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudice about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the current 1,200 employees of Goodyear.
Therefore, Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on starting compensation for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the plant’s purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we guarantee employment time when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg agrees to the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-North for more than four years.
The benefit of Bombardier is decreasing, while aircraft deliveries and orders are decreasing
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a decline of 15% in its net profit Thursday, under pressure of a decline in orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided any trial data on flight for its new CSeries aircraft or information to know whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial launch schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the latter only fled three times, and then the question arose whether the test phase was on the right way.
The results were not up to the forecast and the share rate declined by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating Thursday, from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential to increase the exchange in the next quarter or two next quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program advances.
However, if no new orders are announced over the next few months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market dominated today by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of late.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far moderate to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight trials to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its 300 firm orders before the first plane was launched in commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program advanced in accordance with the schedule.
“The test plane has not stayed on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a phone conference, adding that ground trials and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and plan a period of update, and that’s what we’ve done.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analytics are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said she was assessing the entry schedule and will provide new information over the next few months.
“This slow flight trial – although it appears to be in accordance with Bombardier’s internal calendar – strengthens our opinion that entry into service will be pushed back in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier’s net profit dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result per adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income slightly declined from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a $4.56 billion income of 10 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer said he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders dropped to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division amounted to $32.9 billion by September 30, unchanged compared to December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautical revenues dropped by 13% to reach $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, said that the division’s income had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division’s orderbook totaled $32.6 billion by September 30, which was a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from issues of execution concerning a few major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares rate, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc.’s financial management, would sit at the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third aeronautical manufacturer and the nearest competitor to Bombardier, said Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23 and 27-year-old speleologists were missing in a buffer under Crolles’s Teeth since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Iser aid Speleo.
They were located on Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to practice and the other not, went underground Thursday at 21:30 a.m. to take a crossing of the Crolles Dent, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news from them since, said the same source.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5:00 in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarms, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon on Friday, the two speleologists were located.
“It’s another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network,” says Le Dauphine.
The two military in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found “exhausted, but not injured.”
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps in waiting for the relief, the prefecture said.
Fed, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalist union on Thursday invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services after new revelations on U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Journalist Federation recommends that journalists avoid new orders to use search engines and messaging from Google and Yahoo,” she said in a statement.
She considers "scandalous" the information from the Washington Post, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, chairman of the union, who claims 38,000 members.
Fires Repaints: Member Requests Brigitte Grouwels Resignation
The project of minister Brigitte Grouwels for "relifting" the points of signaling lights in Brussels does not like everyone.
In reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project to paint back 16 points of signaling lights from the region with the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to paint all Brussels signaling lights, for an estimated cost of approximately one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of the capital's "flamandization" and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "resignation".
"Not happy to crazy spend the money of the Brussels in the relifting operations of the colour signaling points in the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its Capital Flamendizing operations," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-sleeve-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-yellow-black the pots of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Brussels deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who itself runs the NVA program.
It is time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"In reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels," concludes De Bock.
the Port of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The eco-tax portic of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national has been diverted in the step.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomov, portician manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticians in the state of working in the Finistere department, the other two have been demonstrated or sabotaged.
Launch of a Google Glass Accessories Store
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibers or an intra-ear headphone.
Although Google currently works on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father has gone away from the world of living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I talked about him at the present time,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how to continue to “frequently” it.
There is no recipe, no manual to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch her watch that doesn’t leave me anymore, laid on the night table.
This is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my gestures everyday.
Our mother left us after her struggle with cancer.
At least that was what I thought on the day I found her body empty, cracked on this hospital bed with rubbed linen.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the lean brightness of the candles that enclosed his bowl.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought that felt mourning.
And then she revealed herself while unveiling my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother’s person, but just a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who incarnated that person during her stay in life.
When I died, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and behold, I found her full and entire.
This tour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as outside," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was painful...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, lending my body to him.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time, and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I constantly feel them near me.
Every event, every moment in my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said, what would they have thought, what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, only there’s always one thing that prevents me from doing this moment.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and enroll in my story and they actually continue to live and share my life.
On the early day of my ultrasound when I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was awakening, climbing out of the bed, my father was waiting for me on the stair and he smiled and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my stomach.
I liked to share this moment with him and I enjoy to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died from cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That means the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor I was at the time.
In spite of all, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interesting in the Middle East, as well as making it a master in a large school, have not been, with the backwards, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard her speaking Arabic in my childhood, and speaking of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has taught me are always present, so I may think about how she would want me to act at a given time.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and righteousness of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a kind soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes stirring on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that triggers alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, unconfused moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only remained the lack, this unanswered vacuum, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me at the hole of her gentleness.
Still, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worryed eyes sitting on me, I see the hearts that stirring his eye, the lips around the lips that dig cigarettes, the folds that mark the front on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so little by little we got to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer tabu but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hole of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself in my dreams when morality is a little bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was the head of orchestra and we try to stay in the path she had tracked us.
If a being loved you very strongly, absence cannot remove it from your heart and memories.
Being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 because of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was born a little boy.
If I sometimes have my convictions different from theirs, I still wonder whether my actions are in line with their vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a contrary direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he's going to think about it.
I don't know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It is soon 30 years that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and my son was six.
The immense punishment that invaded me then, of course, was mitigated, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "lands" in my dreams so precisely, so living that when I wake up, I'm even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going right, I told him no, he answered "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in anxious and anxious and turned on the head lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to come.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn to see if he is not there, I know that it is him and I talk to him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave the house where we were happy and or his mind lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to specify that I am society with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have plenty of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except to my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the most bloody month since 2008
October has been the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people died last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister was received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants aid from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world because we're part of it," Al-Maliki told Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will extend, and what happens in Syria will also extend.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by the Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They blanked pancarts accusing him, among others, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocainoman Lawyer who informed a Drug Spouse of Police Investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be revealed in the great day.
He was sentenced to a three-year imprisonment sentence by Liverpool Seat Court
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations of his drug trafficking activities after compromising his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was called "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "first-important file", was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officials saw Sarborough, 32, depositing three cocaine bags at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he attended a Barreau dinner with colleagues.
Surveys revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this A-class drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, portfolio, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to unlawfully obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were at the time monitored by the police as part of a major investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were later imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to the criminals because he feared that his addiction would be revealed in the great day.
Today, at the Liverpool Court of Sessions, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell disgraceful after he was convicted of two heads of charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after police, surveying Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta’s home and placed a 60% pure drug under the lawyer’s waste in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in phone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium of Ewood Park, pregnant at the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and they call themselves nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied consuming cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his customer and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all captured and a hair sample was taken from him.
In an interrogation, he declared that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it was happening that customers call him at his home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimonials that he called major drug trade actors, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If someone must know not to violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer and being too involved with individual customers.
The relationship we talk about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his customer.
He hindered the police's investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but dishonorated her.
He has been too closer to some customers, especially Scarborough, and left to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied all illegal action and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta moved from a criminal lawyer himself as he began purchasing drugs from criminal organizations.”
His addiction to cocaine has compromised it forever and has made it vulnerable to the back-thinkings of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to secure herself behind the vernis of her profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Ditta, who was convicted of the three cocaine possession charge heads and now hindered justice, witnessing his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you to courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity with heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five others involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On her site, Ditta organized a question/answer meeting on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the corridor of death in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin goes back to stage in December
Detroit News reports that the Queen of the Soul will take place on December 21 at the MotorCity Casino Sound Board Room.
In November, Ms. Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous Respect interpreter had stated to the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she is “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of Christmas lighting
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of sea edge covered with a light coat: the hot shot in Menton could be broken with the lighting bill.
Facture which, unlike many communes, is further settled by taxpayers, not by trader associations.
In order to reduce its costs, the city uses leads.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there were at least two injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the author of shootings.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff went to the excursions or on the tarragon.
Soon police intervened and a man suspicious of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of a airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classic song for teenagers
Each time, the school customer will be targeted, an initiative that had experienced a lot of success in the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by the region’s artists, vignettes containing a high dose of humor, young people are allowed to appreciate the classic song.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyrics Art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrics Destinations, a formula that now makes room full at the Chicoutimi Pulperie.
Two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving the opportunity to the region’s artists to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Lyric Apéro, the concert-benefit held last August, with the support of the soprano colorature Marie-Éve Munger.
It was an activity-benefit, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of La cauve-surry.
Without providing specific figures, Chairman of the Board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant supports.
"Finance is going to float and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operet, a step we will pass in seven years," he said.
"I would say even beyond," added Director-General Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child as hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six charge heads, according to the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada.
Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of capture of hostage, sequestration, threat, wearing weapons in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
“The quick reactions of the policemen involved and their ability to immediately disappear the situation were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” said Captain Bert Paquet.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New Request for Collective Appeal against Sainte-Croix Brothers
A new request for collective appeal was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have occurred this time at the St. Joseph Oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submit, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was served as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people asked us, "I was in that place, can I register?", says Lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal, which has just been filed, has a particular feature of enabling the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints of 25 people who claim to have been aggressed by the Sainte-Croix Brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the congregation of Sainte-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse against children," that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological constraints on the victims," that they were "common to sexual abuse and perpetrated"
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the brothers' lawyer Sainte-Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by the research done in the archives about this by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the step of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second step is carried out, i.e. the hearing on the background.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to resolve the friendly before hearings were carried out on the background.
Important fire in a trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the district of LaSalle, Montreal, on Thursday to Friday night.
The rescue was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who have been dispatched to the place took nearly an hour to master the firefighter.
The fire “caused significant damage to the building structure,” said the head of the Montreal Fire Safety Department, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the stage.
There were no wounded, but nearly twenty housing, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be provisionally accommodated, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical aid to die at Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, held this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to soothe their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we focus on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she regrets.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, Vice President of the Alliance of palliative care houses.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would anyway be unnecessary.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the bill of Quebec disorientes the population on the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn’t believe that Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, stated that the notion of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Kenyan press is indignated with controversial media law
“It’s a scary country and it’s legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from breaking the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?”, the newspaper said by contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconic and very punishable, and we refuse it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court “will always be partial because it’s a government extension” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya instead in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to the journal The Star, the new bill will enable the government to have “the mainstream on the media.” The Standard has, in its view, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had suffered a hard shot” and stripped the bill calling him “draconian.”
The bill is adopted at the same time as a range of measures to strengthen national security in the seal of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate Shopping Centre last September.
The Kenyan media raised the authorities’ anger by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the attack stage stole so-called the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by calling two journalists and a media official to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a shield lift in the media.
Under the new bill, the media can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “radiated” or no longer be able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an injury if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animate blogosphere”.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist to The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and collection.”
Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took position against the wage cuts ordered by the National Commission and restored their mirobolant wages of approximately 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) has caused all an excitement to the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Saté, in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement departures, maternity leave or short departures, the pharmacy department has been highly deficient in staff.
It lacked nearly 30% of the employees needed, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time employed pharmacist.
We didn't resort to troubleshooting, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or decreased some of our activities inside the building, the time things replace.
It’s certain we’ve worked hard to interest our young [pharmacy residents] to let them come and stay here.
There is a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this tough period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the CSSS Pharmacy Department.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
Furthermore, the department's efforts to retain have been fruitful, as the four students currently in Laval have also decided to remain in use of the CSSS.
Now it's going much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will thus fill our departures from last year.
Always need croissants
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the hospital pharmacist shortage or a predominant young women in the profession, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always run at three maternity leave when it’s fine, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we have no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career in the cinema with the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotical memories of a quarterly age accro to sex since his adolescence.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with her eldest is stunning: a bridle silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not forgetting a certain taste of the risk: the one that had not hesitated to lay naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
A Nymphomaniac extract raised the temperature on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has been used to push her actress in their latest retraints, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, by precautionary measure, as a result of throat bits felt by the spectators.
The director of the facility immediately evacuated the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the background of tear jet?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that the cinema management has played the principle of precaution and safety of its customers.
The room was aired and everything went back in order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers have regained the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in citrus
Taking advantage of Halloween’s day, a woman tried to enter the country two pounds of cocaine hidden in citrus, Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of passenger luggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three citrus, which had been previously screened.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Gendarmerie Office of Canada (RCMP), which took the relay in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesman.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since early 2013, border officers at Montreal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics.
Aerial raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered the Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short-range ground-air missile charge SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
The new air raid of Tsahal in Syria (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid occurred under circumstances approximately identical to the one that occurred on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous U.S. official who had confirmed an Israeli attack at CNN, this time targeting soil-sea Yakhont missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of obligeing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, doubting the ability of the former Soviet republic in recession for more than a year to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-" and falls into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, while S&P seeing at least one in three chance that it will be lowered again in a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure enough foreign currencies to meet its high foreign funding needs,” the U.S. agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s exchange reserves dropped by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the refund of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the collapsing hryvnia, the agency is increasingly likely to devalue, which would swell its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to repair its imports of gas to Russia, which accuses her of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of heavy tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry of Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the day after official statistics were published showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter of consequence of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months, which had granted it a $15.3 billion credit in 2010 and has unlocked it for now only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new framework until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, particularly by increasing gas prices to the population.
At the end of a new unfruitful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "important external funding needs" were "a vulnerability", while also "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, “one cannot expect short-term improvement.”
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections planned in 2015, the expert said.
The only hope is an improvement in the international conjuncture.
S&P also stresses the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signature of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P said, fearing Moscow's "trade restrictions".
Russia, which represents a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light at the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they have received no objection from the U.S. authorities to merge, thus approaching the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger approaches the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group announced today the expiration of the previously announced merger examination period of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a statement.
They state that they also received the necessary authorizations from Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the examination period provided for by HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions shall fulfil several of the conditions necessary for carrying out the operation.
“The merger is also conditioned on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and approving shareholders of both groups,” they added.
Congolese army pursues M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be beaten after being expelled from the northeastern towns of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which it controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and accumulate it everywhere it hides because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have martyrized the Congolese people for too long.
It’s time to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reverses would in no way change their demands to peace talks.
The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Hanging is reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
In November, the insurgents occupied Goma, headquarters of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight of the government garnison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in DRC, the world's largest in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid brigade of intervention composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC mayor was remanied and the army went to the offensive against the M23, making it change the course of the war.
The pace of progress in government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to end,” predicted a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time the government of Kinshasa succeeded in beating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accuse Rwanda, who denies it, of military support for the M23, which was made up of former Congolese military muted.
British diplomacy chief William Hague invited Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame to demonstrate restraint, a spokesman for the Foreign Office announced.
Last week, Kigali mentioned the possibility of military reprisals as a result of the bushes dropped in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
“We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unthinkable to us to be one day freed by the army,” an inhabitant of this boundary town of Uganda testifies.
"We lived in terror (M23), we are traumatized," he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refinement margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining withdrawing from the group’s goals.
Its third quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, $2.69 per share, one year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters were on average on a $2.71 profit per share.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent daily during the quarter, rising compared to 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% growth in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits from downstream activities (including refinement and chemical production) dropped from 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refinement margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s leading competitor, Exxon Mobil reported Thursday a declining net profit despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
Educational transport: the complaint considered acceptable
The Scholarship Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires since the beginning of the school year a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from two residence school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is offered by the commission and I was interested," said Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested an additional deadline to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to agree and to find solutions," said Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hôtel-Dieu emergencies
Faced with the frond led for several months by some of the staff and multiple trade unions, including the CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "decalcate the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November."
An official request to "no risk taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed not to disrupt the PS campaign at a few months of the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should nevertheless be effective at that date.
Even if, in the APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who had approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the Emergency Hotel-Dieu will have all received to order to take the thirty serious cases a day to the Emergency of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internats.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency interns will leave place Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
“The Hôtel-Dieu Emergency Reception Service must close as soon as possible, and for us it’s November 4,” assures Loïc Capron, chairman of the APHP’s medical establishment commission (CME), who supports the project of management.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he tempers, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior urgent physicians will remain on site, he also says.
But it is to the RSA to decide the closing of the Emergency Reception Service.
“Things are doing progressively,” answers Nicolas Péju, spokesman of the ARS for whom, on November 4, “there will be no change in service delivered.”
"The minister has lied to us or we have lied to him," urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek regrets.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the frond against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" against a "cynic" decision taken by "medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are empty and asphyxiating emergencies that have been renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly swallowed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at Lariboisière's emergencies.
The RSA argues that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will have also been strengthened.
In the ARS as well as in the APHP, the “new hospital model” already launched since October 7 is defended and is expected to continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, generalist liberal physicians should also come to participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care".
"Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression."
This will happen as for Level 3 maternities.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best care offer.
If the minister doesn't take a measure by Monday, we're going to change his bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser in Paris and elected from the 4th district, clearly announced that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintaining of emergencies at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we are responsible."
Anne Hidalgo, PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had pronounced a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that was the case, she would mark her net disagreement, says her spokesman Bruno Julliard.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of retreat to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end the listening it was performing on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, an American official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to recover his hand in the case of the NSA’s listening after the revelations made by former analytics Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the intelligence agency’s IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked on this issue, a U.S. administration official answered: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance towards the World Bank and IMF seats in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the responsible did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had given order to cease these practices over the past weeks.
This instruction was given almost at the same time as that which ends the listening of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday strengthening controls on government monitoring programmes but authorized their pursuit.
The committee introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
UN welcomes new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now start working on a new series of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began before the day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by global leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said earlier on the summit that it was now time to “overcome national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development objectives,” he added.
These SDGs will be based on progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Framework.
I will do the best to fulfill the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Safety concerns in Mozambique grow at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, touching them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Worrying about the future of her country, she exchanged her workwear for a Portuguese "we want safety" shirt before joining the crowd gathered on the Independence Square of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost every day relations that report conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo, the worst attachments since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebellious movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the party in power and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other responsibility for tensions.
The Renamo states that the government is the cause of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the Sofala province, a traditional Renamo bastion, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill the group’s leader Afonso Dhlakama and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French news agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he remained to try to prove he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist to say that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to soothe the tensions powered by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are not to stop fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, a speaker at the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know well to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are planned next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of Renamo's votes has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to obtain more votes in the election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartite democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unknown exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it carried out disturbing lightning attacks on police offices and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most clutches occurred in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has strengthened the government’s frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the country’s future is the government and the president, and that it’s the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “patterns of lifestyle,” says the author.
Thor’s Legend might show that “brutal force doesn’t weigh in the face of subtle rush,” while Arthur’s legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland has advised “a thorough selection” of age-tailored works.
“I think great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have pleaded for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely discover” with messages being “sublimed” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of view.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And he must be sublimed; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from the Hamas Army branch was killed tonight and another was injured by a Israeli tank shoot in the Gaza Strip, he said from medical and safety sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they washed an Israeli armored shoot.
NSA’s spionage: the United States is “too far,” Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denial between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I acknowledge you, as the president did, some of these actions went too far and we're going to make sure that this will no longer happen in the future," John Kerry said at a London conference he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31.
In his retransmission, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information collection practices through the necessary anti-terrorism fighting and preventing possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities have since defeated numerous attack projects, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented aircraft from falling, buildings only exploding, and people to be murdered because we were able to be aware of these projects," the U.S. diplomacy boss argued.
And, John Kerry told the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been mistaken."
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it's gone too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to attempt to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel misleaded."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR", led with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the only month of January – ranging from metadata on emails, text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak on this issue, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the chief of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have taken up these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be concerned with "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
The controversy extended Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a broad network of international espionage that also raised China’s anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without his master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
The PSG, the leader in the Monaco championship unlike goals, released the list of players selected for this 12th-day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply indicates that it is "blooded", without specifying the nature of the injury.
Nevertheless, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned to the selection in the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The Father Lachaise’s crematorium organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony in the memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate in the town hall of Paris, has to attend, and will then explain at a press conference her funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsects, more and more French people choose cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the neighbor's burials, it's the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the unfortunate losing a child, they are only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book The Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee for Funeral Ethics, insisted on the "violence" that constitutes the creation, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, “a violence made to the loved body”, which will be “reduced to a bunch of ashes” in very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which would “accompany the phases of mourning.”
There is also a "symbolic violence", which lies to the "deletion of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without harm in some Northern and Protestant countries, still poorly lived in France?
"Because creation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the Book Apprivoise death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprivoise it.
Apprivating the cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director-General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would have right with a burial.
Ipsos’ annual survey shows a very strong attachment to the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their relatives, to be religious (53%) or civilian (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or unbelievers also want it.
The crematoriums adapted to this development of society.
"For about ten years, they strive to avoid the families of a violence waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by ashes," said Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the establishments now offer ceremony masters, who are in the presence of the body to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, naming the deceased, linking it to others, evoking it, giving sense to his death, organizing the farewell.
This is the case in the Père Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, Father Lachaise’s crematorium has been organizing, since 2010, the Toussaint Day, several remembrance ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which he invites families of people who have been created in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast in line, to the attention of those who could not make the move.

In La Seyne, relocation for rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left her apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat Terres Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to relocate the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses to "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company performs two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our charge, at every request of the inhabitants.
Thus, since the end of last winter, we have conducted 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to abandon, and the rats do not pull out in the city.
For environmental protection and public health reasons, derating products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, we will not kill a child.
“We didn’t invite the rats to our home,” defends the family father who left his home to stay at the hotel.
We are soon without the money and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has pained the decline of the dollar against the yen, harmful to exporting securities and warning on its annual outcome launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) at 14 201.57 and the Topix given 11.23 points (0.94%) at 1 183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of flames in Old Quebec
A fire that triggered Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were sent to the 9th Hébert Street.
The flames declared themselves in a house of three accommodation distributed over four floors behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminar.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
“Then the alarms succeeded, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it’s buildings glued here,” France Loiselle, spokesman for firefighters in Quebec, said.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of the poster heads emerged at Carolines, and have experienced a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year’s event will be the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening for the former fighters at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Billsby.
The festival has taken a lot of magnitude, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year’s festival have passed through non-traditional circuits, showcasing for example shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the joyfully lacif football fantasy from the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is yet more known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a unique voice (surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial justice defender W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal comedian historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he performed a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the City Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he descended a street between two buildings and said to himself, well, if I lose all my money, perhaps I would come to live here.
Oil price continues to drop and approaches $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to decline Friday while concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report that shows that the Chinese gourmet electricity manufacturing sector is increasing.
The U.S. reference gross price for delivery in December dropped from $14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a decline of 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest increased demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to reinforce after growth rebound to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that has not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent gross, a reference for the international gross already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Removal of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeal court has restored some restrictions on the right of voluntary interruption of pregnancy in Texas that had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a bill adopted in July in that State, which broadly challenges the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The appeal court's ruling means that physicians who will practice IVGs must have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his status of a hospital caregiver, to admit a patient in a hospital or medical center in order to provide diagnosis or treatment there.
The defenders of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state’s clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this “admission privilege” for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first-instance judge considered that the provisions concerning the admission privilege were anti-constitutional on the day of the entry into force of the law.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who bridged the Governor's position, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first-instance judgment that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return in force, a side of audience, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV posts, which is 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the appointment?
Approximately 10,000 candidates attended the auditions of this 10th season to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perche André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored during this first premium.
Like every year, the first hearing shows have a wide choice of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account there.
There are many who tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make them laugh.
Court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and investigation policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and investigation program on Thursday and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the end of the appeal by the city.
The judge decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has applied to its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and the associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed of the case because it violated the judge's code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge decided that police officers violated civil rights of tens of thousands of people by misleading black and Spanish-based men as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in neighborhoods where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after police check.
The hearing of the city appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Spanish origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Participants promoting changes in the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unjust practices, enable more effective and trusted police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morals without decreasing crime, represent a waste of money, and would not resolve the broader problem of pressure-based police forces after police personnel have been heavily reduced over the past decade.
The judge emphasized that it did not end the constitutional practices of control and investigation, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenant must go to vote because each of them pay on average $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are forced to increase rentals to help us pay for new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All candidates told us they would attack scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 fireworks, $4 to $5 million for...
Go vote, this is the best way to express yourself and say that it’s enough.
End of service for Elysee's Cooking Chief
Entered the 500 m2 of the Elysean cuisine as committed after working in embassies, the cooker climbed all stages until he became a chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, by Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday places, and fed an innumerable number of largers of this world in a quasi-anonymity until he breaks today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The open-faced man, scattered skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin, has a pastry CAP.
His mother was herself a cooker in a castle of Sologne.
“I passed from one castle to another,” ironiss Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents he has officially made for, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It’s always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus,” he said.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the Elysee kitchens!
Unpleasant to heads of state who showed a relative indifference to land food, "they are all gourmets," gently denounced Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had “a little more developed appetite.”
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As far as François Hollande, who restored the cheese, “it’s someone who loves eating” and “there’s not much he doesn’t like.”
The current head of the state, who returned the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific regime."
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners in Elysea: we must serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The night before is almost white.
Those people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the Elysée kitchens, who took a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, goes with a pinch in the heart.
He said praises.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
The chief will be replaced by his 35-year-old deputy Guillaume Gomez, who has been in the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
An historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-property building, located at 15th Street Hébert, was subjected to three alarms at the fire department.
The fire declared ahead, but rose up on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman of the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a challenge to this city area where buildings are built closely.
The fired house was home to four housings, but no tenants were on the spot at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, although water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of it, but the sappers have deleted the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Out of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets some images escape from his next film including the role-titled, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to uncoiling you in his role as a trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a Long Island Stock Exchange court, who refuses to collaborate with authorities as part of a vast corruption case at Wall Street.
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then climbed up a scam that makes him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the stunning fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains feasts, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple appears to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took a delay due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film lasts at 2h45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to attempt to confirm a little pipe on a link involving then-working Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “beautiful special adviser.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby’s voicebox and “plant permanently in front of his door,” but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
“The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW’s editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people’s house hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they are saying about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW was using three ways to investigate issues: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Is he aware of phone hacking?
He claims the opposite, but we say “Of course yes.”
The rumors about a link involving Clarke were first taken up by NotW’s writing office when a source, experiencing sexual attractiveness to Miss Pawlby, told her that she had been said, “Don’t waste your time with her, she is with Charles.”
A band, on which hacked voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and his sister ranked in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective surveyed her, Miss Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's least facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I really would like to talk to Charles.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiracy with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to having conducted phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraq’s Prime Minister in a flame of violence
The U.S. President was expected to receive Iraq’s Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking US assistance to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq was the most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published Friday, November 1, by Iraqi authorities.
In October, 964 people were killed in violence, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 were injured.
The United Nations has given an even higher balance sheet with 979 deaths and 1,902 injured.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated Government of Nuri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of the US troops, the level of violence fears a new burning while neighboring Syria is in the steadfast of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The increasing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has promoted this burst of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people died in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against Al-Qaeda.
Violence is at the center of the US interviews by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on the promise of terminating military commitment in this country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and Congress elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to lead a “third world war” against Al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nuri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him the partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by his “sectarian and authoritarian policy.”
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s perishable influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
Chinese domestic security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five on Tiananmen square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, darkened on the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of deadly repression led in 1989, and fired killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that are carried out by independentist claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and premedited,” Meng told Phoenix TV.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, being taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver whose name suggests that it is originating in Uyghur and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gasoline-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident has injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican surveys contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has started conducting a large survey around the world about how parishes manage sensitive records such as contraception, divorce, and couples formed by people of the same sex.
The survey asks the participants how priests take care of happy couples and their children, and how they deal with men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.
The survey was sent to mid-October at each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how appropriate to investigate the parishes.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreductible M23, a few hundred fighters, were cut at almost 2000 meters high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not ceased since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," an inhabitant of Jomba told the AFP, joined by phone around 12:30 a.m., and according to a girl being injured by bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have slightly rejected the rebels."
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "sleeved the night" in Jomba before going on the front for a "ratching operation".
Behind him there were very clearly heard clippings fed with light weapons.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place of the fallen rebellion on Wednesday, AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered “a final phase,” the FARDCs “who surrounded the residual M23 positions to drop them.”
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco does not participate directly in the fights, but it provides government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and rocket launches.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border with Uganda, civilians helped military charged a multiple rocket launch mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure the cover of another piloning M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday evening again called on the rebels to “demobilize voluntarily” under the pain of being disarmed “by force,” but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without any results for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
“We have finished the talks, there is only the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature,” said Roger Lumbala, Vice President of the M23 delegation, without confirming this information immediately from the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement.
UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of eager mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Uganda side of the border, where approximately 5000 people had refuged between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed in the midday.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to get back," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by nine children, including a baby on the back, told AFP.
It feels like the shootings come closer to the populations.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this scene beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, songed and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
This is a revolution: the musical in French is asserted as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame of Paris to Mozart’s rock opera, most attempts would fall in ridiculousness.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miserables were the aureolus of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Châtelet and Stage Entertainment to Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes handle titles as successful tubes.
The first resumed, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announced for the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
At Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are going to be a diaphragm of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedy" and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hardly conquered.
How are French musical comedies evolving?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "music spectacles" that evolve in the will of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story like in 1789, the Lovers of Bastille.
Others join fifteen years back on pretext that you can serve about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
Afterwards, we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us revive the Broadway Golden Age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest alive composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon variety musical comedies by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "The Spring Awakening" have difficulty to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singer, playing and dancing like Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn from projects to projects.
In the United States, a musical comedy cradle, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these jobs in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent flow is as significant as the number of positions to be provided.
Why are province tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often from the boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
The musical shows complete this lack.
These are the same young people who love reality television and what it produces as ephemeral stars.
To offer beautiful young men (often talented) in the head of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their whole family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The mayonnaise is risen in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large halls in France in the same shape as in Paris.
A serious wounded in a crash with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident made a serious wounded Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The car of a driver was beaten by a ghost driver, which is free to him.
The ring was closed to the traffic until 9:00 p.m. at the accident location, the time the road is dismantled and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause bottlenecks because the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deviated by this output/input of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His life forecast is no longer committed but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Caribbean pirates" attraction.
It was closed until a new order.
DRC: Army Prepares New Assault
Children played on a carbonized armor that belonged to the rebels of the M23, in Kibumba, on 31 October 2013, in the eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new attack against the last bastion of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to drop the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi is supposed to fall from herself.
It will remain only the Runyonyi hill.
"This Chanzu is not very strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told AFP.
Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
This town is located at the Uganda border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreductible M23 have been cut at almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, an inhabitant who had reported near fighting Thursday all day reported that the situation was “calm since this morning.”
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fights of the past and were buried.
A girl was injured by bullet, and three other people were injured, including one severely evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the fighting between FARDC and rebels resumed on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given any balance sheet of human losses.
NSA’s revelations increase corporate paranoia with regard to state surveillance
On a beautiful day of late August, a German police helicopter overflew at low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the order of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. front post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explains that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation has caused an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal foreign companies’ industrial secrets on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a denouncing, began to unveil his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of the U.S. surveillance, European governments and corporate leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on speech.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has espioned the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused corporate paranoia towards state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vessel overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interests.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the United States poses a risk as high as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the EY advisory firm.
However, in all documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to US companies.
Politicians have announced their concerns that the EU does not have enough computer and internet capabilities and believe it should strive to reduce its addiction to the United States.
Corporate leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly.
“This is not the right way to do,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German business software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is granted in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the US spy agencies exhibited by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock for some companies who so far thought China was the biggest risk in terms of monitoring.
A major change is happening in cloud computing since European officials acknowledged that the data stored in the United States is governed under the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10% of non-U.S. members have renounced their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations on the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers today ask us a question that they didn’t ask us a year ago: where my data is kept and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at any cost.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s chemical manufacturer company.
The Americans spy us commercially and industrially, just as we spy them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders are usually unsuccessful to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Big companies have long hammered the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB drive at a professional lounge or to leave a laptop unsurveillanced in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Automobile Manufacturer’s Board of Directors, said that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid cell phones during their trips abroad due to the risk of achieving the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, it is worried that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. warns their own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of hacking economic intelligence acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “Services know perfectly well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spion their allies.”
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in unusual circumstances think their son was murdered
Parents of a teenager from Georgia whose body was found in a fighting carpet rolled in his high school gym, think their son was murdered, the family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the gradines of his high school gym.
Sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family disputes these conclusions.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, attorney representative Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics as well as the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the persons responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their sons to school with a cardboard and they returned him in a mortar bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation of Johnson’s death, highlighting several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was deceased by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he puts up elements of nature to justify a civilian or criminal investigation of Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of Lowndes County Sheriff's office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A Southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to submit all video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that video images contain indications about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes tips on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre published a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies in school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, since the number of children at school age suffering from food allergies has risen heavily.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffer from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the teaching body and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools to have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to respond quickly in case of potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
State legislative assemblies have recently updated regulations to enable schools to easier have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something whispers my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have a bitch on my tongue.”
NSA affair highlights the total absence of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which from one side offenses in public by calling the U.S. Ambassador on 21 October, and from the other forbidden the Bolivian presidential aircraft to fly over the territory, on the basis of the rumor of the presence at Edward Snowden?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande phones to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the magnitude of U.S. surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the World columns a few weeks of the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and on the other a conviction of the NSA’s hearing of the Quai d’Orsay?
Wouldn’t there be a wave of hypocrisy from you?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil over the analysis by U.S. diplomacy of political issues or other issues around the world, we indeed consider that, in view of U.S. power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe the U.S. interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to denote this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The largest ten years of highly powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, have been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have established almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures, which are described as essential on both sides.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah has been reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the U.S. services, and, in contrast - it was already said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
Therefore, the substantial issue behind this NSA case is not the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the complete lack of prior debate, particularly within Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of freedoms infringement.
What do the United States actually risk a degradation of its image?
We've been denounced, but I don't know how they can be punished.
The American risk can be double.
The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have tended.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies, in the light of the revelations, rely on to entrust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. laws, and therefore to the NSA.
The vast movement of revelations committed by media from around the world, which helps launch a debate on intelligence services monitoring practices until then, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "indetermined sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of newborns will no longer be attributed to them, in a rigid manner, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, authorizing them to enroll an "indetermined" or "not specified" sex on their birth certificate.
The aim of the law was to remove pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make rush decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain the patchwork that the doctors created, contused and bulleted.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 child born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality belonging to the sixty-diseason group of diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term designating people with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovarians or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexual.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he added.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transgender or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes caused by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conform gender now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third-sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her trial call allowing her to keep a “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third appointment next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this land-catholic country signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed German law, writing that “Since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown.”
In Maryland, a baby’s mother also said on Baby Zone she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies upon birth.
“The parent’s role is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And almost a decade ago, the medical community considered the genus as an ardoise, which can be erased and on which can be redesigned.
But now, there are many who challenge the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can mistake, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignation when he grows.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they were not called the psychiatrist, they were calling the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He devoted the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signals – how parents raising a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as a male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as John/Joan, his theories resulted in controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a black circumcision to castrate him entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors “repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex change operations say “that they are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was taken from female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he suffered vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs can develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following testosterone treatment and was removed his breasts.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexual people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director-General of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child a “indetermined” sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better assign a male or female gender, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only move forward to hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third-sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind,” she added.
German law relates to the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to this age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a disorder in sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law “will account for” parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, Katie, 29, is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or mother carriers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so that they don’t have to make hasteful decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before entering “male” or “female”.
So, everything goes well – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is necessary,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and this is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusted in the longevity of her government
President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition in power at the approach of the Senate's vote to drop Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the left-wing center leader said he has "closely intended" to continue ruling with his coalition until the upcoming legislative elections in 2015.
The high chamber of the Italian parliament will meet over the course of the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his destitution.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October his refusal to give up to Berlusconi’s orders who had already wanted to drop the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the fire exchange.
Firefighters called on the drama site claimed to have responded to a call reporting "multiple injured".
"Order forces are on the spot," the airport says on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed a person evacuated on a bed, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 local (12:30 in Montreal) at the airport terminal 3, the airport also specified.
The Los Angeles Times states that the teminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to immediately confirm if one of its employees was injured.
All flights at arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank shootings killed a Palestinian activist from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, healthcare sources said.
A source from Hamas explained that fights broke out in this region because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar shoots.
The Israeli army has just evoked a “targeted action” in the area close to a tunnel called “terrorism” by the Hebrew state, dipped at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Obama’s campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have considered, in the biggest secret, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event in the 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president’s close employees had conducted “deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s revocation could help Obama to re-election while his hopes were declined.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fulfillingly kept within the Chicago Campaign Chief Executive Office and inside the Oval Bureau.
Only half a dozen close president’s advisors – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign chief Jim Messina and the former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the burden to replace Biden, despite their “narrow personal ties,” before finally decided against change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “does not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in a form, and therefore we were asking each other, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualifying the exam as “concerted,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the reelection campaign had invested a lot to find out whether the change would be beneficial during the election.
“The campaigns don’t devote much money to surveys and discussion groups unless they are seriously planning to take steps,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the possible redevelopment.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “had been aware of” of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted he was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitely answer the question of whether the political surveys had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama didn’t know that Biden’s expulsion from the presidential list was considered.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first medusa-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminoscent snack.
He had the idea of it after reading a medus study and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the Lick Me I'm Delicious ice company, said: "This is something incredible but we are only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at pH neutral.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice begins to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve created because the luminescence of the meduses is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about £140.
But she has pretty good taste!
The company at the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and golden leaf.
But his next creation will become even more ambitious.
He added, “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It is intrinsically impossible due to the refraction caused by the ice cream crystals, but I think I will find a way to get it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of meduse synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai Chi session
Singer Lou Reed died as he was doing tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and aimed at the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of a musician who split the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to take her out of the hospital and take her to their house in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the formidable joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress to go to the neighborhood.
Today I became more pink.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it anymore this year.
But the statistics show that I am the gourmet sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – in fact 158 million – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after dresses are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no trouble to stay traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't gland.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This accounts for about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sweets, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who are going to hunt candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, don’t tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This accounts for about 9 billion corn grains.
It’s a mystery that I haven’t yet come to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the hated houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you putting you up on what your friends put on Facebook and that you can't take away and on which a guy you like leaves a commentary of the style "beautiful head."
Finally, let's talk about citrus.
Charlie Brown presented us The Great Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin, it’s like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we’ve been little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby-crusher trend” began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pots and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in citrus, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lanterns that softly dropped on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lanterns were grown this year.
If you’re looking to make yourself noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try to sculpture their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a default structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure to relax its relationships with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% within the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it within three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional provision for depreciation of doubtful claims of £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the construction of the cantonation structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London emphasized that the "bad bank" would draw a track on the past, because the government was particularly accused of engaging in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for the customers and the UK,” new CEO Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallys
The interior has 6-point seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
These options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said, “Lovers of rally joining Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for rigorous and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of pleasure developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be thrilling.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck at 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career
Ruby, Spanish cocker, escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person who walked his dog stuck in his career.
Firemen went down along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely as it was pierced 15 meters above the ground on the instability of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spanish, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, travelled to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in her career following a serious accident.
On Wednesday, about 14:15 a.m., a person with a sharp sight who walked his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in his career, stuck at 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team from the Cleckheaton Fire Casern rushed to the place and went down in reminder to save Ruby using a animal casseron to carry him up to the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's okay now.
She eaten cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said, “Ruby had a lot of chance to get out of it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted to the veterinarian for control; his general state was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, “I was terrified by watching the relief.”
First I didn't think she was up there.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fading, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were eager.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added, “We were afraid she’ll fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorist on Jagger’s song “Old Habits Die Hard” in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18.”
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger’s representative said he “categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to appear at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, landed at the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges Turkmenistan Islamic Movement
"The background support to the attack came from the Islamic Eastern Turkestan Movement based in Central and Western Asia," Chinese security bodies chief told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video released on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), spoke in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official appoints a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs from one family in the dominant Muslim region of Xinjiang, border of several Central Asian countries, have precipitated their car loaded with gasoline bitons against the entrance to the Prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 injured.
The driver, his wife and mother died in the fire of the car.
The Etim, which declares fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among affiliates to Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is posed by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakdown of Europe gives Scottish choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of threads barbed along the wall of Hadrian.
Although it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic impacts of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the big titles (and it was to be expected).
No one also said that the EU member states spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, a continuous failure to comply with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in counterpart of all that it wants to obtain from the Scottish.
This is a story that isn’t one.
And a story so old that it is now stained: I heard the fool for the first time that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
However, we forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow Europe's instructions?
Why exchange the London yoke to that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the major post-war plan to unite Europe is definitively dead.
With the euro crisis, the Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties who oppose the EU or armed for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, earn ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes in the federal elections of September and released the Liberal Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on national economies through adherence to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for Greece.
The European system has rather weighed on its members the exchange rates favorable to German exporters – what German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, southern European countries face an intrinsic productivity problem with Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper problem related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to grant French and German energy companies at consumer cost – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas than the United States.
This is a rehibitory disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wages in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being punished by a cheap U.S. shift gas.
As a result, the revolt grounds, especially in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal foot with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to disrupt.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s extreme-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, returning socialists to power to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that reminds it that it cannot come from the principle that a right-wing will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity in the French white working class?
She wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European anti-money block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the unique anti-European and anti-money feeling in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like “the Europe of Nations (sovereigns)” free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite savings could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I hope that the United Kingdom will take its distances from this project, and I hope that it will make the eyes gentle in the United States.
However, Washington’s increasing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left accountable in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending a walk to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that has best succeeded in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implementations) by the Chancellor of the follow-up Labour Democrates, Alistair Darling, and the conservative coali coalities.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent.
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think obesity epidemic could be an early puberty trigger
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter’s pubian breasts and hairs start to grow at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast spray, hair under the arms and in the pubian area, and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight progress in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half, while it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
“Once the chest began to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test to learn how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinolog to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the occurrence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can hinder growth and small size at adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on child's age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that “controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioral problems and feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They are afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even the way they are going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10 years old.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the school frightened and disturbed by being the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or media-provided sexual messages are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years old that bind the percentage of fat mass to puberty trigger.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms appear to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubian area, the tendency towards genuine early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubian hair is common, even in infants and infants.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the real appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedoendocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice to learn how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Homage to the people of Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the brothers Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that just began to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been subjected to a retrospective at the French Cinématheque, had rolled the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of hiring Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their decay on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop-planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humour-film where music is a central character and live-interpreted songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself a performed folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, her friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious joy.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich rounds in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less bright clothes, a gentle voice when she sings, but the interest debited to the mitraillette when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week the tribulation of a folk singer who can't pierce and get angry with the entire earth.
It accepts replacements at the foot lifted in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A Documentary Air
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interested us: a mix of misfortune, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a carrier but integral, with self-destructive behavior,” Ethan Coen told the press, couroned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
Although Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes a documentary, the dusty label invaded by 33T unsold by an unpayable old secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers occurred.
The magic of the brothers Coen still works by integrating a funny character that constantly crosses the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking eye, Llewyn Davis’ wealth companion.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled to have "granded in Tennessee, baded by blues and country."
“My first lessons of music were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to “be considered good,” “the chance can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, “the most important thing is not to be stuck by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves.”
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He would never have known the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gerard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin."
In February, the New York Times devoted it to "the author of novels of spying who knew too much of it."
He spent ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of novels of espionage.
Decreased physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved during this trip with a deambulator.
And before Afghanistan, he was also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“No doubt, everyone is confused between 120 and 150 million countries,” he said in March.
His Birman cat on his knees, in his immense apartment in a Foch Avenue building, two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, cited some of the languages in which the SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between bronze or ivory reported from the 130 arpented countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a package of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the advantageous chest, wearing a gun or a strike gun.
Inside, his Serenism Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian Aristocrat and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairs of the family castle, throws up to the bundles of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself as a teller who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked “as the great reporters before war, Albert London, who went on the spot and returned with real and long investigations.”
The father of SAS said "making a kind of geopolitical leaflet."
"I'm constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villiers.
On site, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, services people I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
Therefore, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Foots of Benghazi," he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, a cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he performed the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako," he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make hypotheses from countries that I know well, and some of my hypotheses occur from time to time.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM marguerite writing machine dating back to 1976 "which all the pieces were changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
The walls of his office are attached to AK-47 attack guns, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two phrases.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, has no age."
He will not die or retire.
Not more than me.
Aircrafters fight about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute is raging among major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long trail flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aircraft fair that takes place this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of the seats proposed on long-court flights to passengers in the economic class – which are not always the most courtified by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential for increasing efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautics industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its large American rival Boeing states that this should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as planemakers seek to sell even bigger versions of their long-court aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing declares that its redesigned 777X will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange strikes on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls to the public directly before the Dubai Aeronautics Show, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We could recently realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a picture that shows three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-trail flights in narrow seats than in regional turbopropulsion aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’s business director.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined the modern long trail journey, and the century’s turning, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Health Department.
The average American size round of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus declares its rival engages in a concept of headquarters dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly called "jet set" aircraft was narrower.
Airbus added that she ordered a study that indicates that an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures regarding seat width and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities,” said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a matter that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute, a race of aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, sufficient to look at the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what powers the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per-seat performance in their latest long-court bimotor models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the configured device with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to casing more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, CEO of Comfort Passenger at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are pronounced in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go together with cheaper rates.
“A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from the commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose from.
Aircraft sellers who walk around the world carry even a meter with them to check the competitive configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional trips.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large equipment, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautics industry in order to set up a standard of size for seats resulted, but that it could make it forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tear the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just awarded from his ship's victory at the Americas Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle’s boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year closed in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but he received about $77 million related to stock options.
Its fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 decayed year, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5% while the 27.5% high-sized exchange rate, exceeding the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could suppress smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect life from mice from nicotine addiction.
Other tests are needed before starting human testing, but Professor Ronald Crystal at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this type of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having its dose of nicotine.
During the tests, vaccinated mice to which nicotine was then given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “was calm,” the researchers said, signing that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently so antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms the liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban Chief killed by a drone
The Pakistani Taliban movement leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a strike on Friday by a US drone in Pakistan, security services said.
Hakimullah Mehsud’s death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time he had lost his life in this attack led in the Northern Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shoot," a senior security official said.
The past day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on travel to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been launched with the Pakistani Taliban Tehrik and Taliban (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied that he had changed the trade cash policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his balls in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a coffee, after expiring in August 2005, without any tender.
She now investigates allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the Government has pressured the subject of tenders for the bail.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, Circular Quay’s enterprises, which reported to the Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favorable to tenders.
But he denied that he had changed his policy at Mr. Obeid’s request, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed a change in government policy in the field of badges.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls past in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's orders at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of trade bail policy?” Asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
“No,” answered Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at all, it wasn't that.
Not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, an official says
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port town of Latakia Thursday night, a military official confirms to Fox News.
The manager did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile loads in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to take a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently examining the possibility of implementing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers possessing a 457 visa while planning to extend repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a diverted means to bring their family and friends to Australia.
A government work paper has been unveiled today as Labour Member Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
"The breakthrough statements on the "return to the end of the row" and "jobs for the Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions asked for a protected labour market," she told the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The work paper reported the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to “whether the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or the data subject within the company that sponsors it.”
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arrived on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of the man traveled to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father’s death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was immediately transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as of the opening of Phase 1 by 2026.
Transport Minister Kramer said the project would “assemble the UK.”
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said he was “excited” with the idea of working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England from 32.7 £ to 42.6 £.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity strengthening and improving travel duration for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh from up to three hours.
Baron Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring closer to the UK and its cities.”
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are huge.
Without him, we are facing a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight in the global high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I am looking forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.”
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain current in Australia
Australian air passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during the departure and landing despite the U.S. gesture to dissolve electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "plane" mode.
Passengers can already do so during the most part of the flight, but many people find it difficult that they are not able to access their e-books during the departure and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but said they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it is reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by aircraft,” she said.
The issue is the subject of regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with the security instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the house of her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said she was complying with current rules today.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during the departure and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change this,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that may benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transportation programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“Once an airline has verified the safety of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronics such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to shut off their aircraft during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely ranged under the seats or in the upper compartments during the departure and landing.
Pia: At least four wounded in a violent fight
The small municipality of Pia has experienced an unusual excess fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a coupling of thirty people according to the testimony collected.
On this Halloween day, the evening was stirred on the side of Pia where a rich involved several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four light injuries would have to regret.
Alertly, the gendarms went on the spot to separate the belligerents and ensure that the injured are taken care of.
Singapore's lenders are taking advantage of middle classes constrained to tighten the belt
At a lender at the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for his daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she said.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, became this week the third lending company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry saving is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's lenders are taking an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fundrainer with a branch in the same mall.
However, wage lenders have the advantage of not requesting solvency verification or wage proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region are turning to lenders on account while families feel the pressure of increasing living costs and overdebt of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap monetary policy-driven credit in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to lenders on wage to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing debt of households, primarily from the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore were recording the highest debt ratio of households/domestic gross products in Asia.
Malaysia reached the top list with 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which started this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with the rise of costs, people in the middle or lower [wage scale] seek to complete their income as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to have pressed themselves to put their personal assets into the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items in the 200 loan shops in the city-state are golden.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put the grandmother's gold chain in the payment and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest lending shop operator, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the wage loan sector that ValueMax, a shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO.
The company will finance them using 60% of the $66 million from Singapore that it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Scholarship.
While some low-rate lenders have wiped out criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that wagering offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but the more it does not increase the debt directly.
“Customers hypothese the property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase the debt of households,” she said.
Socially better accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to lenders on wage are not just those who have financial problems.
Easy people from Singapore also go to ValueMax lending shops to put gold lingots or Rolex watches in lending, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see customers from all the layers of the company.
“These may be easy people who need to borrow short-term for business activities or investments, or small businesses who have cash needs to spend a difficult run,” Miss Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of youth pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who dealt with young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning after searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor served, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials say Mr. Hudgins has resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform in the supermarket before being thrown away.
A man dressed in a barred Nazi uniform with a brassard with the gammed cross was asked to leave a British supermarket, customers complaining to the office of the institution who called the police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” said a spokesman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The shop called the police to rescue, but "the time it comes, it was already left without sparkling," she added.
I was doing my tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were beed mouth.
"You don't go out to the street so unless you wanted to draw attention," a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred Thursday, Halloween's Day, where it was customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing a black SS brass twice a week for three years at Asda,” said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 billion rescue plan for the vulnerable health system is combined with strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the aging of the island’s population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system’s constraints.
The funding, scheduled for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties that the state is facing,” Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up the delay.
Funds are also scheduled for non-appointed clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training medical managers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to first line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The minister said the Government of Tasmania would be facing a strict reporting and accounting regime.
The State will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends additional funds.
A commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 billion will not count for much “unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
Nevertheless, he congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will help greatly to remove Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely inverse the recent cuts.
But opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the state has removed $430 million from its health system,” he said on ABC TV.
We cannot have a state government that draws almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and claims it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebells, she faces the unlimited cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotical fascination for another.
The film never throws into lubrication or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, the supervisory agency says
Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons surveillance agency said Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in northern the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline of the
On 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all units of chemical weapons production and machinery intended to mix toxic gas and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious calendar to destroy Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to continue to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fights were raging Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Britain reported.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of Syrian-based activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces have been killed, of which 18,678 were combatants of pro-governmental forces and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah’s activists.
Among the dead, 2,202 were desertors and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners, are also estimated.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people have had to escape the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops fight against the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The struggles highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OICD, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “now pleased to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned for the moment.”
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
The OICD said on Thursday that the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OICD inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OICD Executive Committee.
“I welcome the moral strength and courage all of you have shown in the framework of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Uzumcu said in a comment by the OICD.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there was a strong explosion in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by punishment against one of Bali bomb owners
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted angerfully to the punishment pronounced against the last conspirators to be brought to court, saying Umar Patek should be gunned by a execution balloon.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most sought-after men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence yesterday for his role in manufacturing the explosives used during the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old was guilty of mass killing for attacks against two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a perpetual detention sentence, yet they could have asked the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb manufacturing expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions carried out by Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution balloon," Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was entirely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 hrs on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack charged with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He was darkened in the coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times as he was under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others, it's not a lot.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb owners to be brought to court.
He was able to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda chief Osama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t go,” Mrs. Corteen added.
Until recently, he was mocking out of the grief he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can, however, appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not calling with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listening to music – but not speaking on their mobile phone – under the new highly expected guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew member training manuals and the rules on aircraft storage to be in conformity.
The FAA said it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic aircraft on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are one of the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve widespread use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to re-light them before the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the plane is descended before the landing and do not turn them back until the plane has launched.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interferences will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during departures, landing and soil rolling, the FAA said.
Most new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendees, said he was happy with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for this – it will be profitable to everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are honestly tired of feeling like “hall supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS, or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled with noise from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always need to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory power regarding mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the prohibition on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interferences with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An Industrial Advisory Committee established by the FAA to review the problem last month recommended that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased over the past few years to simplify restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. argue that there is no valid safety reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to shut off their devices, or do so deliberately.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interferences with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of then.
New line planes are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also designed to resist electronic interferences and approved by FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Modified aircraft to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resisting interferences.
The vast majority of line aircraft should enable wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only issue minimum transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure to remove the restrictions regarding the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders loaded a Kindle e-book reader line plane and flyed it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee of mitigated feelings regarding whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with plane systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to shut off their aircraft during instrument landing under conditions of low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them to arrangements full of meaning for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitrated bird from a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird, helitreated after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water rail was risen on board a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before the Scottish SPCA was delivered to its rescue center in Alloa.
The center director Colin Seddon said, “This water rail was probably a winter migrator that came from Northern Europe and came in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added, “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help us.”
The water rail was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together businesses and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey from British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow while EU states stagn.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than engaging in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arcans.
When asked for their opinions on specific political aspects – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that control of these key skills should return to Westminster’s hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate from the benefits to be part of the European trade area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, even agree.
Finally, and even more, our survey with business leaders revealed that a majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists on a “significant change” that returns power to the UK.
The challenges are high – achieving changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would allow 16% of the votes to maintain the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt once: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to be better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a narrow economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means for businesses re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not deroge from Halloween's tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed tastes to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween’s holidays on the eastern coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of the Sandy Hurricane.
This year, the feasts came up.
In New York, thousands of people frequently participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is overexcited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally could wear the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy people, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need it.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All-Holy, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgarian gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
“A historical event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest-scale project in Europe,” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify export pathways from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, a country through which most Russian gas transits to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project will be launched in 2015.
Gazprom said the construction is expected to start in other countries next to the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve, the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, receiving information from Radio Australia.
This island, in the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He was British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutiny Bounty, an episode of the history of the British Navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly the descendants of the Bounty mutiate, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on London’s generosity.
The island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy of the island mayor went to London asking Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 square square meters, however, provided that they have the means of monitoring it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place surveillance military ships.
As for France, it has already to lead the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, neighbor of Pitcairn.

Living prison for former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life jail for corruption Friday.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuans, Chinese official media report.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and responsible to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March last, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as untreatable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mouses" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former leaders of Petrochina's oil giant.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former CCP head in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions within the state.
But the government has nonetheless demonstrated the intention of reforming the system of fighting corruption by creating, for example, an independent party organization.
Two of the YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was interrogated about two cases: a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, advisor to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate by emphasizing, “YMCA external checks were carried out and indicated that children’s safety was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the seconds worst assessments of four institutions during an audit quality of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord’s recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of children’s safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on twelve boys for the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum 6-year prison sentence.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures towards children's safety.
Staff members witnessed that they had observed some failures, including the fact that Lord stayed alone with the children, he kept them privately, made them sit on his knees, telling them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she was the childhood officer of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would frame Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director-General said he rejected the staff's testimonies that they were reluctant to reporting these defects to their supervisors.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord broke their judgment, making them not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views before the YMCA council in New South Wales, saying that for the organization, the lesson taken from "the incident Jonathan Lord" should not concern "the reporting" by staff, and the council was agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the staff of the privacy agreements, shortly after the allegations were mentioned, was taken by the Child Services Director-General of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an “excessive zeal” and that it had been misunderstood.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe child organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith to the Commission.
He indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion on various national policies known.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a special envoy of the Quartet for the peace process in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to Prime Minister’s position, Blair would have replied, according to London’s Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so...”
When many equestrian demonstrations experts met in Cardiff to fight and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew that the competition would be rude.
But no one expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the child and his Shetland Toffee pony scored during the three towers with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two unseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual contest held at Sunnybank Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff.
He was presenting against men and women in elegant melonic hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side relaxedly to scroll his 2 year old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his uncommon natural qualities of training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.”
They showed themselves against and against all, but they both wrapped the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy of joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been involved in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it.”
He walked through all the length of the running track and even though it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
In the way it started, he will certainly soon participate in the demonstration of the Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he will make a beautiful service.
An annual equestrian demonstration spokesman said: “Fenton is only three years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They are a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were showcasing well and how they walked on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "going to be remodeled"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be re-made, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted winery pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will be undergoing a “full re-redemption,” the regulator said.
The order of “remaining” comes from the Guangdon administration for the Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion company listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose a administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a full New Express removal, and recommended that he conduct an investigation of responsible people at New Express and immediately remove the newspaper management team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of crafts named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and his ability to gain public confidence,” he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it primarily because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his first page apologies, writing that he hadn't correctly verified his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year forbidding authorities to force anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "availability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a rad.
The radioactive steam leakage detected on one of the two nuclear heaters of Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October and while the boat was in the sea was "no danger to the sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
Indeed, the Royal has just confirmed us the "availability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
On the other hand, DCNS, a defense naval specialist, assures that its teams and those of Areva, shipped in the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heating.
"Everything is implemented so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can do its planned deployment in late 2013," DCNS said.
And the National Navy certified that "it does not challenge the ship's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes from a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had applied from Toulon to mid-October for training.
This is particularly in order to qualify the young hunting pilots.
A "small damage", circumscribed in the reactor's confinement space, had then occurred on the French fleet's amiral ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I am able to see a strong dissatisfaction from the people I encounter: monstruous re-assessment of their properties, tax flood, licensing costs of all kinds, administrative costs to be no longer finished.
In short, unlimited siphonage of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a very respectful tax of those who pay.
Any money withdrawn from force to taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their poverty.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, we do not disturb the high spending and maintenance of lame ducks: deficiency cultural center, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not cost-effective, they are sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also important to find the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
I, however, give an honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not the public level to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to hear that Fisheries and Battery lakes will continue to supply the city with safe drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline in the population, the use of water has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Without mean wasting, the city will never miss water and the severe regulations regarding its use could be greatly soft.
In summary, it’s easy to do great things with others’ money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by crabs with beautiful degrees for most and I don’t think a sheep farmer is worse.
Discovered a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they’ve ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on a length equivalent to almost six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area is full of indefinite warehouses, which allows for easily hiding drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were unseen, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intention of sale.
They apply a 10-year prison sentence to eternal detention if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that left the kitchen from a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who refuged to the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she had issued a 40-year-old "notice" to Australia, asking her to attend a police office, adding that if he didn't, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible pathways under British law after the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal he appealed against his extradition early this month.
Fearing that Stockholm permits his transfer to the United States, he found shelter at the Ecuador Embassy in London on June 19, asking this country of South America for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has issued a notification to a 40-year-old man asking him to attend a police office at the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under caution.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the opinion by the police.
Assange is afraid of being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks’ website fighting against secret information.
How Biometrics Invade Our Lives
Does your passwords end up in order to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Morpho, even believes that “the century will be biometric.”
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for IT and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for recognition of footprints, the shape of the hand or the veinous network of hand in companies, administrations, cantines...
"Everybody will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime," says Justin Brookman, Consumer Privacy Officer of the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism, among others?
The biometry will rely on new techniques that will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, the most used biometric data in France are the fingerprints, the hand contour and the veinous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
“For example, some people working on concrete have very damaged fingers and their imprints are illegible,” says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of the Identity Domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the veinous network and the contour of the hand implies a voluntary and accurate gesture of people.
It is both a safety - one cannot capture this data at their uncertainty - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been conducted for about 20 years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colorful part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the calculation capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border stations using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of Intel Labs Security Research.
Unique and infalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But the analysis of DNA is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (acknowledge one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is the one he claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (fingerprints, photographs, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State has on all citizens already identified.
This makes sure that someone does not attempt to usurp the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
“We recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for NEC France’s business development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: taking a picture that makes the tail in a store, follow its progression through facial recognition and calculating the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (boundary, protected places, cantines...) or logical access (a computer opening).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"One biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points for another," says Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to remove money from some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the strike of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and big distribution signs: at the time of paying in store with its credit card, the customer does not stick his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers might soon arrive with French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometric attractive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in the box thirty seconds less, it’s appreciable,” said the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer customized services: within a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which blocks if we try to move it,” Philippe Robin, de Thales, says.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
“The progress in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me afraid of the worst: a widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick from the Office of Privacy Protection in Canada.
A 210 km/h driver with a hot drink between the legs inflicted an almond of £1,000
A driver was inflicted a £1,000 fine for rolling at 210 km/h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was discovered driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree height on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without caution and attention required.
The seven points withdrawn on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also convicted to pay £90 fees and a £100 victim tax.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to break the London bubble
The Treasury temporarily encrypted the capital gain tax measure, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold property within a company rather than individual securities.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents £708 M for the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Northeast Scotland, Northwest, and Yorkshire and Humber gathered.
Mr. Cook said: “As a result of the increase in the law of stamp on high-value properties and the introduction of anti- avoidance law in this matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-imposition regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners reluctant to the idea of selling,” he added.
The prestigious real estate – 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located southwest of London that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show a regular year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing “domestic market”, southwest of the city, northern (7.4%) and east (6.5%) having a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s perspective), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what it was in other species.
He added that, like in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordinated tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs were included.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take a long time before we understand why their tail goes sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained, “We have presented to dogs films where other dogs were included – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we have been able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression moving the tail to the right (from the view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail diverting primarily to the left (once again from the tail moving dog's perspective), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would deliberately communicate with each other thanks to these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be concerned.
He added: “If you meet other dogs repeatedly and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on this experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, invited professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
In another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, “Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in different studies did not entirely consider film animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take a long time before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys Reports Concert in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with her singer.
The Sheffield group was to be held Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city center.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after asking for medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November.”
Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he couldn’t happen in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any discomfort caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket store where you bought your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest men of church placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect it, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will finally choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this is a group of 120 “cardinal voters”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to cardinal dignity, known as a consistor.
“Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistency in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of voters will probably decrease.
He declared that a pope generally named as many cardinals as needed to make the number of voters reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
For the moment, there is a kind of tendency to prioritize Europe and, in particular, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will named cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with examining the ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He added that it was “entirely possible” that Francis asks for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it’s completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities as a cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat records
General Motors Co recalled nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulatory body.
In some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the inclination mechanism.
As a consequence, files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for header supports.
“If the vehicle is beaten by the back, the header may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to the owners due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth in sales of vehicles in October.
Pickup sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by approximately 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 Sierra.
GM’s shares rate rose by 1.4% to reach $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to the likelihood, works done on the foundations have been carried out in this place for a while.
A mitoyan foundation wall had just been built in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim just arrived on the site to recover her tools.
I was driving by car and I saw the wall fall down with a huge cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who stays near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We saw only a part of her back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the fifty years who worked for a co-frosting company.
Reanimation manoeuvres were tempted by emergency services, but not successful.

The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts dejoued by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I’m reading a sad book these days.
It was a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the boldness of the second year of medicine and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and is the memories of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients in the evening and I sleep, this book reimmed me at the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newspaper presentators took the time to think about the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cry for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went forward to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transitional period prior to its operation in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are as far-reaching memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's credit for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the "never seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama’s administration against my peers and colleagues, I cannot provide any explanations.
I am on the edge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the charges of denunciants who reveal the government’s wrongdoings.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, the evasion of public funding and the excess of the expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House’s efforts to reduce media to silence are “the most aggressive... since Nixon’s administration.”
And more recently, she cannot apologize for the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed to not allow to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we have been heard of talking so long.
Yet, while the favourable opinions index dropped below 45% this week, it is even harder to return to 2008 through this book.
He desires me for the many promises that have fled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses for Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campagne meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on the right path and remain loyal to their cause.
“I want us to renew our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
A violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Friday at approximately 5 p.m. in the street of Retinne in Fléron.
The 26-year-old Jonathan of Fléron was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters might be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The Mining Extraction Magnat, which disputes the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument to try to remove questions concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast headquarters in Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a removal of the vote removal system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should the election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact details on a computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the vote bulletins.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone is not agreed?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied possible options regarding electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
59-year-old Palmer said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We do not seek a reward except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical moment,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of bump dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and the Study of Animals and Miliar Marines (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin surprise you?
It's a good news, but I don't surprise it particularly.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
It is not possible that such progress in genetics and molecular biology would challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genre, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged because of the progress in genetics.
Similarly, two very close species have been distinguished morphologically thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific bump dolphins and the Atlantic bump whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we might have dealt with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or in extinction based on the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility it has to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovered is coming out, its stock became automatically weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
In contrast, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can result in the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Marianne's graves, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in searching for life on other planets than in marine research and it’s time to change.
RBS suspend two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency market division according to two sources close to the file, which again shows that the global regulators’ survey on suspicion of currency market manipulation begins to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world’s largest financial market surveys, where $5.3 billion is changing hand every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the survey that echoes the scandal of the interbanking rate manipulation of Libor.
The bank, who refused to comment on suspensions, confirmed this month receiving requests for information from the regulators.
“The ongoing investigation on this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant messages files, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European accountant for currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Exchange Trading Officer at Citi, was left this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that she had tried an action against some of her employees after Swiss regulator Finma said he was investigating suspicion of exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine allegations on bankers that would have been agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the file reported.
Banks have plugged instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reproachable acts.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers in investment bank trading units over the past few years, but that has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currency that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start impacting the market at a cost-effective basis.”
The news arrived on the same day the Credit Switzerland announced to return a trader working at its London Stock Exchange office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million in late year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case has been controlled,” said a representative of Credit Switzerland.
Mayor Rob Ford’s survey has been overwhelmed, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed to have put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby argued that he never saw a "so scammed" survey.
Ruby told me to believe the Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, reporting new court documents.
Me Ruby called "unexplainable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listening to his phone, suggesting that police chief Bill Blair has chosen in awareness not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could have very well intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and performed a search – even without a mandate.
She could also have requested an instant search mandate, if deemed necessary.
Police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby’s words as “obvious and desperate attempt” to be argued with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European scholarships dropped at the middle-session except London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are evolving in decreasing Friday to mid-session, led by some news of disappointing societies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could denounce its quantitative relief policy earlier than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the whole eurozone, the idea spreads among market stakeholders that the European Central Bank (ECB) could simplify its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures are predicting an opening of U.S. stocks rising after two consecutive crash sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest crash of CAC 40, led by the outcome warning of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks EuroFirst300’s worst performance, after also publishing declined results this morning and announced internal creation of an “bad bank” structure of 38 billion pounds of most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) stands at the head of the EuroFirst300 rises in response to press information that AT&T would study a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as shows John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s strategist.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week.
We anticipate a strong potential for decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the U.S. currency and hit a lower of two weeks in session to $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the contrary, support the eurozone bond market.
Supreme Court applies Obama’s health system reform law
Great victory for Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today stated that the Obama-ratified health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of paying a fine – and said it was constitutional under the government’s imposing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts gathered with the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court has also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid's eligibility threshold should be reduced under the penalty of losing all federal funding of the programme, was compulsory in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates to the presidential election in lice during 2012 primary schools, including appointed candidate Mitt Romney, have stripped against the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civilian, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, made on Friday afternoon a tribute to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza Border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded Thursday, October 31, 2013 in the evening during a violent crash at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate Friday, November 1st, after exhaustion of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas Army branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank bush shoot during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, deceased when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a tunnel digged by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters inside the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, witnesses say.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four “heroes” and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant to Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman said.
On the other hand, the Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel digged in Israel’s territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, to “terrorist activities”.
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, noting that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them with Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive equipment aimed at the Tsahal forces (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Furthermore, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria aimed at a missile cargo for the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, October 31, the satellite chain Al-Arabiya.
An U.S. official has confirmed an "Israeli struggle" but has not given any details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that “the bombing aimed at a load of soil-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement that fights the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Dance her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henry Michaux's inks and poems, the second inserted by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies of Satie.
A party that allows you to see the entire prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space as is the Maisonneuve Theatre, it advances, profile, fine like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole piece: an enfilade of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only their hands and faces discovered, wait on each side of the game area, hurry when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in a group at the unison (a mass that makes it solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each executes its sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the front scene.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be safety when Carol Prieur will refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or retained, a portion of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue to dance.
And the music of going back, and the sequence of going back.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up crashing and dizzying.
Just like the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - creating images has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hair that boiling or those black tissues that elong the lines.
The choreographic approach lacks composition.
It feels like the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: Bodies seem flat in front of drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like forms of Gestalt, open an imaginary wider and giboier than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hacked by stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, affects magic.
The audience loved, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedies, after the draw, are richer.
The scene is partly draped with gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a delayed house.
At the piano, dancers were going to play the partitions.
Their touching musical wrongdoings give a true fragility.
On stage, they pass the couples, in loving duos, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, sets that move, choers, writing is less binary.
Buffons, also familiar to Chouinard, treating the red nose, appear in very polarized parades of loving men and women.
Loves are carnassiers, fleeing or players.
The gestual, laughter, and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies in coit, of the beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotin, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play applause codes, stretched the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensitive.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal prosecution of Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents has started a lawsuit of legal prosecution on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he haided in the stall at the auction of patents that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violation before the U.S. Session Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow us to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, the trial conclusions indicated, which is the core of Google’s business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that operate under Google’s Android operating system, which gives rigid competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer repeatedly, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents faced with Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a part-based market based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed in his attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continued to violate those patents,” the trial said.
Rockstar claims more damage to Google because it claims that Google’s patent violation is obstinate, the complainant said.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater caused by the explosion
The grandmother would have lighted a cigarette during a gas leakage.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which made two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, the King’s prosecutor said Friday night.
The expert sent on site by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother turned on a cigarette while there was a leakage and accumulation of gas.
The life forecast of the two victims is always committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who stayed at his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was burned more slightly.
“The two victims were intubated and long-conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she helicopter and ambulance,” said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the site.
The grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Safely, he could reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the President of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arch Police intervened.
Crisne's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls for the first freely elected president to give an oath
Mohamed Morsi has led the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his triumph day will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he made the oath of investiture to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
In his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He owed before the 18 judges in black dress of the court whose building on the Nile edge was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for better next days, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and hardly repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and cops kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11:00 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, departing from the presidency of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the transition of his convoy to the highly frequented streets connecting the city center to the southern neighbourhoods.
Considered as the little charismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been significantly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red cravate, addressing judges present in the woodworking room where he made an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he spoke his speech of investor.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national hymn as he went to yourself.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, hand in hand..." toned by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of groups of Islamist students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath Friday on Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian regime last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of the military council, who replaced the former evacuated president, dismissed it.
But by accepting to officially swear before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows himself in front of the army's will, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square accompanied spectacular populist gestures.
U.S. shutdown has stopped the rise in the automotive market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations has weighed on the growth of car sales in the U.S. in October, the figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the six majors achieved performance lower than expectations.
The three largest Detroit manufacturers show two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million annualized sales and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he estimates that this slight brake is first explained by “governmental shutdown” and its impact on consumer feeling during the first fifteen of the month.”
Nevertheless, GM reported a growth of almost 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from the success of his pick-ups, saw his sales growing 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
Fiat controlled Chrysler announced a 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales lower than consensus, despite a year rise of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford granted 1.1%.
Renault led in Stock Exchange by Nissan Warning
Renault accuses the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced to decrease its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a redesign of its direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault share was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Paris broker's trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two killed in a shooting near a site of the Neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots shot by two people on board a motorcycle that passed ahead of a place of the Golden Neonazi Aube party in the western neighborhood of Athens, police source said.
The police have not yet been able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their potential political belonging.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Autumn had argued that the victims were guardians of their place.
The wounded person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist police officers hurried on the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburbs, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the charge of six members of the Golden Saturn, including the Chief and Founder of the Party, for participation in “a criminal organization” as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Call Rejected
Scott Brown, Captain of the Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against the Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça for addressing a coup to Neymar, the Scottish media saw its suspension extended to three meetings by the UEFA.
In a statement, his club said "very disappointed," considering his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity across the entire province, shortly after noon Friday, due to the heavy winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected areas are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, Montèrgie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The large Montreal region also experiences its lot of crashes with nearly 7,000 private current homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to overthrow the trend.
The company has reviewed its rising net profit forecasts and expects record results thanks to Australian and UK vacationers.
The travel agency is now expecting to achieve an underlying profit over the entire year between $325 and $340 million prior to taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are achieved, this will account for 12 to 17% of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4M reached in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said Flight Centre had earned 8% in the first half and the second half began in force, especially with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are in the right way to achieve record results on the entire year before deduction of interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the UK, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the recreational travel sector has rebound during the second half, which has allowed to compensate for a domestic business travel market slightly declined.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre’s recreational travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half where seasonal demand is lower and was expected to benefit from the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot a hotel near Cairo’s pyramids
Unknown people opened fire on Friday at a hotel near Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making victims, resulting in apparent dispute with dismissed employees.
The attackers have escaped, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, police general Abdel Latif said.
This attack occurs when Egypt received almost no more tourists since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed in the blood the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthography and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will need to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
As of 2015, students will need to spend an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education has to publish its new English and Math programs tomorrow – the raw materials to be undergoing a radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Bureau, will reveal a redevelopment of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was a “wide consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” emphasizing the fact that GCSE would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students take about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours of time for maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the greater importance given to matters in international rankings – would probably encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The program will focus more on “real world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a bill adopted in July in that State and broadly challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
8-year-old welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-old minors were doing door-to-door to demand sweets in Halloween's evening.
One of the rivers of the Muy neighborhood visited by children opened the door by holding its hunting gun.
The 86-year-old old man explained to the gendarms that he had been afraid.
His weapon was captured.
Former Head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish Cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever being found his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Muller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common tomb of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he said on a daily basis of archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the Afterwar.
German secret services, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally mistaken.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich aviation ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
“In the left inner pocket were his states of service with a photo,” he said.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of Mitte in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the neighborhood.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, declared shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi Sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous poor taste.
"The memory of the victims are grossly crowded on the foot," he risen in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and in particular under his commands, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this country of Western Africa, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect the "Heroes CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father changing the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and going to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.
At the beginning, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he was going to bear the remainder of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompaniing his father in full clinics and hospitals, to get any treatment he could benefit.
“It’s not easy,” Mr. Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 o'clock, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father's death in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 physician for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty threshold, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health expenditure are made in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and as much of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they sit in vans after setting medical equipment on the roof and crossing tough grounds to go to the villages that most need help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have always had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or boiled tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sing and dance and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the holidays.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people every visit,” Bwelle said.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive beads, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate – document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical actions under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Through the lighting of the electronics group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exciting pace, but village musicians generally help the team remain motivated.
“They are hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue to work,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, practiced 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undergone to cure hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to making this traveling hospital live and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances his association at 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he sleeps,” said Katie O’Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in the group of Dr. Bwelle.
He is always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nurse students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn on the field that they don't have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help sponge the blood or bring the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” Miss O’Malley said.
It’s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you’re a medical student in the second year.
Volunteers generally pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and teaching are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” Katie O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not near to turn off.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happy by holding the promise he has made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he'll see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that force me to do this.

Both France by Pierre Nora
Perplex, the academics have long been hard to define and place Pierre Nora.
Teacher in the amphitheater and classrooms?
Perhaps, but emphasizing his weakness for the crossroads, Science-Po, the High Studies.
Arbiter of other works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly yet, but knowing that such a sacred one cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis of which it happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and federation of their works, but noting that he was little inclined to produce it himself.
To this image uncertain the monument of the "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, has also contributed.
The evil languages were able to see a gigantic chip market, presented by an intelligent commentator, equipped with a bright look and reading of study, but unhealthyly diletating.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should make it definitively justice.
However, once again we find there the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagueness, the jubilation set to jump as at the joint feet of one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book to such a beautiful title bring the broker to one passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a time concern.
Here little, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perpetuous mind of our leaders of then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism requires, was entrusted to prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora tracks is different.
He is not an inheritor of an eternal franchise, he refuses to define.
Analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he walks in a symbol forest, arrested at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
This one, which is born from the company itself: Why, in a country so lastingly installed on its borders, so formerly carpented and solidly masoned, can we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure the disorder born from discords in French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most iconic is obviously the one that splits into two of national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but not to deny it; on the contrary, desired to regain sacrality, and the more eager of unity and indivisibility, because it had cut off the head to the evident and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, written a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousin does only better emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no longer to worry about it.
Here, men encompassed with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confides it.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whom we hardly make models, and who have remaining killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here is a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes and trials to recover.
France that leaves, France that comes
There was, however, a time when the French believed they were able to cover the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only one time.
This is once again in debate, undermined by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect of France that comes.
With, as a premium, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve some surprises.
It was discovered that the pathway was a couple.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The roller was in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, here more than a half a century, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had been removed from the initial exercise of the thesis, he entrusted to us, cum grano salis, which he would have done in the end.
In a less sharp, more broken and more subtle form.
But let's not mislead it, just as binding.
For much more than the figure imposed on the academic course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: “Return is quite complex to manage”
Released to Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team came to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has participated in 2004 in the creation of the Hostage Defense Association "Hostages of the World", which he has been chaired for several years.
Its primary objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grace on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families.
Little by little, trying to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouveau Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
Ever since the night of your release, you were on the 8:00 p.m. plateau of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the spot, in particular, in Beirut.
When I’m released, I’m in the box of a car where I’m meeting – without seeing it because it’s black – Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says, "We can still be killed."
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a crossroads.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
French people take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember bathing for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival happen on the French floor?
We land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bousculate.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the staircase of the plane, meetings with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and at home, many bikes follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists are taking themselves to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to make a little bit of the police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to see clearly.
We're going out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we've done the hardest.
In the evening, I’m at 8 pm, the next day I’m on TV too.
Then start a kind of life rehabilitation, very gently, for one or two months that are a little like a holiday.
How did the medical exams and the DGSE debriefing take place?
I had the right to first medical control in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not handed over to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't disturb me.
How do you react to the release of the four hostages of Niger today?
I'm listening to what we say.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I am trying to share the things between the questions about my past as an hostage and my headset as president of the association "Hostages of the world" that allows me to get away, and I seem much more interesting to address.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Especially, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
It is necessary to qualify the taking of “political” hostages – which is mostly the case – and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and is rejoiced by the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in the Hague is made for that.
Why don't we say to the hostages "have you broken down the rules of war, like those of all Geneva Conventions, will we bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, founded, legitimate, struck with good sense.
This message is heard, but not listening, and that shock me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi’s trial
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days prior to the opening of the trial of deceased President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the recovery of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial that the Muslim Brotherhood militant emphasizes.
Until now, no lawyer could meet him and no volunteers could take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi’s trial is a false trial that is raised by a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a betrayer.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violation of gay rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, “all military spouses have the right to an identity card of the Defense Department and the benefits that come with,” the minister in New York said in a statement to the Anti-Defamation League for fighting anti-Semitism.
“But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities” in their territory, he denounced, blaming those states to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these individuals cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access to their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The frond of the nine states began with Texas who refuses to implement these benefits on the establishments of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on gay marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Western Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 people active, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard on Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to group the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9:00 a.m. and the qualification phases will begin in the afternoon at 10:00 a.m., before the planned final at 15:00 a.m. and the award delivery at 16:00 a.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy hyero Lorenzo Palumbo.
Only 10 years old, he has already conquered his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn’t like anything until going back to three-headed competitors.
Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who came to question him about a drug affair
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media.
A video given to justice seems to support these suspicions.
Interested Rob Ford has always denied consuming crack while recognizing having a crack for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled from his property several journalists came to interrogate him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The cat was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
“An epidemiological survey has been initiated to identify and support people who could have entered into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 including,” the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people having been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments now call on people who had been bitten, cracked, cracked, or leaked on a mucosa or skin injured by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"Because France has been free of rabies since 2001, this cat or mother has been imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last “Aboriginal” case of rage dates back to December 1998 on a ridge and that “France is declared officially free of this disease by the International Office of Epizooties (OIE) in November 2001.”
A case of rage on an illegally imported puppy from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Arabia is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," recall ministries and is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama Returns His Health System Reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health regimen, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their service providers, the Republicans have criticized the president over the last few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his promise of origin.
“The vast majority of people with a suitable health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about the terminations, President Obama has encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain complete and better suitable health regimes for the same price, or even less expensive than expected.
“You’ll get out of it winning,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population insured themselves were forced to change their plan because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Allow me to speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who supervises the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately".
“I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,” she added.
I'm looking forward to getting your trust back.
It was an exaggerated Kathleen Sebelius who spoke this sentence, as she believed her micro coupe, addressing to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s Assembly meeting following a disputed exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to see if she should join the Obacar.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to insist on Mrs. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government’s sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel trims a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colours of the automotive brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat to the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-year-old world champion in Formula 1, has expanded for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from its stage.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel had to wear this helmet Friday and Saturday at the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet Sunday for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches its outside party
Let's not mislead us above all.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Party of the neighborhood" is not only addressed to the neighborhoods.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I talk about outskirts, I address all those who are excluded from the large national family.
His project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the willingness to better defend multiculturalism, this large cultural melting pot that characterizes above all neighborhoods.
My proposal #1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50-year-old, territorial attached, claims today to be “100% apolitical” even though it has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know well that the values of equality that I propose in my program are attached to the left but if right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of outskirts and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this risks to be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a problem of time and money.
The neighborhood party should nevertheless be represented in Aubervilliers through my application and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune has already seven list heads in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday are not all out of the outskirts," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American spying “had gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry indicated a deepening of the US defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions the spying “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that, like Barack Obama, he had ruled on “autopilot” when a series of fire-revelation revelations by denunciant Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government in the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at a video intergovernmental conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other government members had known some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course, on September 11.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had exceeded the limits, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to attempt to clarify and clarify people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels misleaded.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to attempt to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have well prevented aircraft from dropping, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spy matter and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, Senate Chairman explained Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had speaked before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had spoken about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration that the surveillance of the National Security Agency raises.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment to fighting terrorism,” said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which harmed relationships with some U.S. allies, however, the director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence services, James Clapper, justified allies’ espionage by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office organized a Congress journey, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said the goal of this trip was to enhance relationships, but also to be “loving firm.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have applied themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make spy,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the rage caused by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down Thursday, led by Shell’s bad outcomes and the day after an announcement by the Fed to maintain in the state of its support to the economy, as expected.
Australians appeals for imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney inhabitant, sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for alleging wrongly being attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the judgment and was released under caution.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first sentenced guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered her, had attacked her early Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she was safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to have invented the story of all pieces.
She was detained in a cell of the local police office before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the periphery of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously lived an annoying moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed to the judgment and was released after paying a 50,000 baht deposit.
In Australia, the press said it was on vacation in the Krabi region, southern Thailand.
Thailand’s judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an overwhelming punishment for up to two years of imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket by Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to surround its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will stop supporters of Anderlecht coming other than with RSCA cars
The French police decided to lay strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, spokesman for the Brussels-Midi police zone, Friday.
The Belgian fans of the RSCA who wish to meet the Champions League will have to use the movement system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stadium," the spokesman said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"Although other supporters were intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture announced that measures have been taken to take arrests or even guards in view," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff, to reflect on the ways to better integrate students living horseback between several cultures.
The school committee has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The Vision Diversity organization has been walking for a year in schools to help students of all origins discover common marks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are remarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are a tribe or have come from anywhere else.
Who are our builders?
“Therefore, we create projects so that they can identify themselves with all that,” said Diversity Vision Chairman, Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we live in the student customers," he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who also sometimes come from.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
“Different educational strategies are the true need,” she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
