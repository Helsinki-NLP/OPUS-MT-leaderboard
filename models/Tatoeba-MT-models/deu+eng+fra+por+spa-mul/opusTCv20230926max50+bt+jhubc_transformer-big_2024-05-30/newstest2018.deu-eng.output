Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A crazy place where young people are to meet today.
A burial capelle where the S-Bahn tunnel is graved.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
Munich’s oldest official map promotes exciting stories to days.
It's nervous if maps aren't up to date.
Everyone who had to be excited knows that because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the State Government, are all other than current - but just because of this very remarkable.
Especially when compared to current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the Munich Merkur spread area since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flick patch that you do not recognize as such.
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called original position sheets.
According to the Bavarian measuring administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first measuring of Bavaria.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic accommodation of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801 finally declined, it was today’s neighbors who created the idea of a widespread Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian administration of measurements.
The Original Position Blade for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landes Library, like all others.
The comparison earlier/today is the most impressive in the example of the country’s capital.
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was made 21 years after creating the map, which is to say in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, subsendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Untersendlings houses focus around 1856 along today’s Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers’ uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the west park is today, there is nothing but fields - at first glance: at the Hinin Zoomen, a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten corridors numbered from the so-called "recording" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels there today are no longer farmers - but small gardens of the plant "Land in the sun".
A large green area is characterized north of subsendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the Oktoberfest, was actually a nineteenth century, and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original letter, in the area of today’s district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße was once locked people with madness.
In 1858/59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Ventilen" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the chains of the so-called mads.
Furthermore, he has banned staff from applying violence against the prisoners,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the office.
For 280 patients, it was first placed, later extended to 500 places.
In some cases, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Circular Irrenault in hair in 1905.
There has been the Isar-Amper-Clinic Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.
At the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural reliance on the original construction of the Irreninstitut, which had been destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the "Main Square", the Kaufingerstraße called the "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought World War II to the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies rose many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A large one stayed until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a burial capelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn railway.
The old Munich card can be compared to the today’s air image – and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorfuls has issued a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to keep extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents are recently occurring throughout the state and here.”
A recently adopted Missouri law that makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as state law enforcement authorities disproportionately aimed at minorities, led the group to issue travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of citizens’ rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are collapsed or killed,” said Missouri President NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early this year after he no longer had gasoline during the trip through the state and was taken in detention by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s office showing that black drivers are 75 percent more frequently stopped than whites in the state.
“The recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and employees are informed of what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be ready to bring cash with them or let relatives know they travel through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program that rank the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the country’s 16th rank.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry to other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the action in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidesaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weideisaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.
At the Right Grabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operation, where he manages 55 hectares of grass and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 milk cows and equally many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, says Schwendenmann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidesaun project "elementary important".
I cannot economy profitably in such a steep area.
The green land area takes care of a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the motor sensor.
"We have to struggle with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann said.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it did not operate bio.
Mayor Thomas Schneider said: “The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidesaun project and is happy with the Leader’s support.”
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that the refreshing of the areas could be pushed away for a while.
“The biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worry about how they continue to operate,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often in criticism due to promotion.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were encircled over the Weidesaun promotion.
The opening area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forecast until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71,500, half was funded via Leaders, one quarter was borne by the Fischerbach municipality.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidesaun.
“The great advantage is the longevity of the arrows,” Schwendemann said.
Kordula Kovac said, “You do a really good job, without farmers and peasant women it doesn’t.”
Peter Weiß also said, “Here are the best food produced.”
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables the government to promote grapefruit.
The objective is the opening of the Black Forest.
Prerequisite is the presence of a conveying culis designated by the LPR.
Furthermore, the enclosing area must not be traceable (more than 35 percent) and therefore must be threatened by refouling.
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaun project, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels are currently running, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of wall.
The opening area is 35 hectares, and the calculated cost is more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump’s White House now takes up the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other – therefore the carefully scened fall Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axle in a warm dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta on the President’s drastic suggestions to restrict legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he acceded to their meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta spoke, “I don’t want to come up with a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom.
Miller is actually right, but as he formulated it himself, it’s not really about history.
It’s about the contemporary resonance to Lazarus’ exciting words, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants but the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poors, / your pressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There was never a time when the "ellen waste" was better to be seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trump’s USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a high-political act.
The sculpture should demonstrate the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic illustration.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John of the Baptist for Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom did not invite anyone, but is rather a early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The lightlight should not light up the way to the United States.”
Very unusual Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is a question of the view of perception.
Lazarus’ great imaginative act was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, poor but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is truly about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you need to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their faucets should not lighten the way, but inflammate the hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
UK’s light athletics director, Neil Black, says the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Championship Scader will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will be launched on Friday.
Black believes that "it's developing something special in Scotland" and the UK's light athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find it out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will reach Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain talk was incredible,” says Black.
A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh entered into naturally was great.”
The Commonwealth Silver Medal Winner, who will be held at her fifth World Cup at the 400m-heads, says it is "uncredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland’s best total athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The Middle Railway Runner Muir has led this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotland to be watched after a great season that included the victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotch in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "enormally proud" of the fact that many of her colleagues are not only belonging to the team, but in some cases also in the medals and in the finals.
“The special thing to be a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honor, but knowing that my teammates have voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
“Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we have arrived.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podies.
As to my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I only noted that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being again at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t join a public office if you can’t tolerate voter heating
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take a long time until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal policy to his political principles.
He was surely criticizing.
But he didn’t make his critics silence.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, foolish and silent, we will be led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union accused him for this early week.
The governor's stab released the lawsuit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counterresponse with "Na, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hitch head.
He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing to debute his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the Governor’s side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor’s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing else than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the pitches online.
The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hate, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I kindly commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post".
“I don’t appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a point on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective engagement and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called “concentrated spam attack” would likely call others “for language”.
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than before, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or arrest and silence demonstrators.
That’s exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for scouting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter fell last week in Virginia.
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County infringed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable ports had a similar effect as the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers engaged in his leadership.
Even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't make them silent.
Freedom of speech, dispute and discussions are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next to Archerfield Links last year until the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place of exhibition and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reached its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is an eager defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year-old career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
“This really feels especially,” said the player in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the homeland action.
This event will be its first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little bit more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy how much it's gone."
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, the parking space costs £5 per car with one inmate and £10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from passive lung cancer.
The result is that scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE) come in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 cases of lung carcinoma are due to passive smoking per year,” studies director Heiko Becher said.
As a comparison, he took his own study on this topic from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases in Germany because of passive smoking per year.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections proven to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are fully running and "lies somewhat in time," says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the field of home connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since it hides much in the underground, which was not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction group of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red lights and gateways is already enormous," said Heinze.
The road is closed and only the line buses are entitled to crossing.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days have been very hard.
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cook dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai county in the disturbing Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coiled knot is taken and dipped with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the flat floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with drunk water from the nearby sump.
A bucket in a roofless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagemen are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
“Nobody dares to walk around the village after 17am,” she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote by a public survey before the occupation forces.
An existing movement, which arose for independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province’s capital Jayapura to Nabira and then a 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transportation.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo rains and wave sheet roofs converted by roast into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, not journalists, but practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago of Papua worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wear these clothes,” says Degei and indicates her living, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright rock.
"We had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty limit and some of the worst childhood death and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesian Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has decreased $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military preserves an overwhelming presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport’s local military members and units were paying nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papua’s demands for greater autonomy threatens this golden gain and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s Tribal Highland in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We'll Lose Everything" says in a 2016 report from the Archdiocese of Brisbane, containing reports of previous year's agressions, such as illicit executions and torture - rape and electric raids are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua’s resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning cantines sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable with nozzle sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local, who moved to the province’s capital Jayapura.
“It cost the native Papua – the mother [the women] of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
“Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored,” says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers stumbled on her tone and later returned with four soldiers, says the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their pistons, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers went into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so heavily that he fell into the koma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and introduced the Waita dance – continuously in the circle and imitating a bird song – by Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremia Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto District of Enarotali, looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the people to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his coloured wood house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overwhelmed, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Johanes, who only carrys one name as many Indonesians, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they are attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police Speaker, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more were injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical misfortunes in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he introduced an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that must be passed through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “it will be regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, which the United Nations accused of “crimes against humanity” calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been addressed, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai sacrifices received such claims with grievous infidelity.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress,” says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped buri four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military looked for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniales neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited village inhabitants protested in front of the company’s location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded to it by fired warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.
“We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly introduced here.
“I hid two days in my house.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to account for the officers involved and withdraw the police’s mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe families Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal living in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the Rebel Army, claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, under the pretext of the "security of national sovereignty".
Some never appear again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat, especially notes and fruits and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabira airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to better trained and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills necessary to lead their own business competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions on international media reporting remain tense.
Early this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s election campaign’s promises to remove reporting restrictions to encourage transparency and development were not realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s disturbed eastern provinces of Papua and West Papoa: visa denial and a black list,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group’s allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it’s difficult to purge the evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take this awareness.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Ambassador for Human Rights Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pushed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they probably won’t vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots,” says Gobai, chairman of the Tribe Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooting victims led a last symbolic act of trouble: the victim’s body was buried on a ground precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never happen to them, but at least they do not let the responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with a lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai’s ‘Torch’ cloud scratch for the second time
On Friday, a fire found its diagram in one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of residents to escape the 337-metre-high, 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire that runs through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept, and we arose up with fire alarm and crying of people.
“We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” an inhabitants who named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civilian protection authorities said fire fighting units at 4.00 a.m. local time (0.00 a.m. GMT) turned off the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it works on providing accommodation for the concerned.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world.
A survey by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from the clothing, the outer clothing to decoration or insulation came.
In the UK, the police said they believe the system of isolation and clothing plates at the London Grenfell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has broken through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two win rates was not supported by the required two-third majority.
Although often very long, but just because of this very highly appreciated five-sets classics are retained to the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted for the reform, and ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was therefore only failed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
Not until the vote had been made, according to many claims, before the proposal to issue the final at a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: Thus the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next year.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements for training places, etc. will be easier and players will need to complete less official media terminations before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers bring banned items to the airplane, finds a survey
A flight passenger survey found that more than 20 percent of objects consciously or unconsciously prohibited were trafficking past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration control points, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other objects with knives.
Less than 1% claimed that they had late discovered that they were mistakenly traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travellers were rather violating the rules.
Of the respondents who consciously tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, were members of Generation X.
The most common items passed by TSA agents intentionally were foods and liquids.
More than 3% admitted to being aware of wearing items with clips by safety control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it has asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally would have brought trafficking products through airport safety and how many would have done it intentionally.
It’s no surprise that people who are most likely to carry smuggling – consciously or unknownly – through safety were the most commonly flying.
However, the company notes that the TSA policies are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
Therefore, it is no surprise that the largest amount of items forbidden by the TSA are liquids.
For some time, people thought that the TSA could view books as a smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn’t matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Electro-Tusensassa Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has previously suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation again.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla’s chief Elon Musk has for the first time announced the recent quarterly balance sheet a different, less brilliant number: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In the past few months, Musk has often announced the more than 500,000 pre-order for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.
Now Musk acknowledges: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn again.
Criticians had repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.
With a cancellation, Tesla will fully return the $1,000 (in the US $1,000 and in the UK $1,000 pounds) "Reservation Payment".
Currently, 455,000 of such non-binding reservations have been invited, Musk agreed at a telephone conference with analysts.
That cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem, however, the Tesla chief doesn’t believe.
His argument is that the challenge with the ambitious growth goals is not demand, but production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected - all models together - to be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its new, never-tested production routes without greater interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are greater delays, then the unobligation of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from escaping in many.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay of Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Authority, took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce smog emissions of air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency showed itself to the needs of state environmental authorities more responsively than previous administrations.
He did not mention the appeal appealed against his previous post in a federal appeal court.
It’s about a deadline that passed on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-near ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "mixing himself into local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental rules for a long time before his appointment by President Donald Trump’s prosecutor of Oklahoma.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal from Wednesday is the latest legal reversal for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his return to ozone standards simply strengthened the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Among previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to observe the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged with by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date for implementation,” said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that we have seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt will somehow use his “power to delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that the rules are “based on a solid policy and the best available information.”
The Republicans in the Congress urge a more comprehensive resumption of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The action has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York Prosecutor-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that EPA had accused this week, said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
“The EPA’s reversal – according to our complaints – is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and the environmental guardians rejoiced about Pruitts surprising change of course.
“It’s troubling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the air protection manager we breathe in,” said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crossroads, offering pollutants and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to a serenade to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 a.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preserve of the oldest building in the site have made the friends and conveyors of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: “It’s a unique domestic petition.”
In 1267, the St. Hilarius capelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church therein to Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
The text of the document after it stood on the mountain of Tumling, except the former parish church, also a rural court, to which the church or the patronate law belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As outlined from the description of the Upper Official Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the underdorf and the upper village, which are currently recognized in the village of Tumlingen, the "Mount" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The patronage law was created from the early Medieval church law.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest remained owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This was associated with the right to set up a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two is crushed at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648), the windows were hit and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was unclean.
In 1796, French troops held near the church.
They broke out the channels and church chairs and used them as a wood.
The remains of the church threatened to fall down in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last rest place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church disrupted.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell down.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was disrupted.
Only today’s tower remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen invite them to the sixth cerenade on Sunday, 16 July, to the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Capelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 a.m.
Entrance is from 15:30 a.m.
For the sound of the Serenade, a converse is held in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows to the forest," the organizers exhibit the fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlings and Hearing Weilers.
Friends and promoters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade Organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to check approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim resists" does not consider a legal prerequisite for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Association has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen, a wind turbine zone only existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area.
These zones are intended to prevent the “saving” of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the plan of use of the area, the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve because of a form error.
“Because of the lack of planning legal condition, the authorization decision is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawal,” said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of things: Before the summer break, the city council decided once again the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nitte; an approval of the district government is still out.
Remarks: "At this point, the grant of an authorization for the construction of wind power plants is excluded by planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been entered at the Viersen District last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them for the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to lead to the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court on Thursday, the circle did not intend to express content to the arguments of the association "Boisheim reject".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four wind wheels per 200 meter high on an area on the Boisheimer Nitte.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved had concluded package agreements with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares.
The construction of the four wind power plants is intended to cover the electricity needs of about 11,400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sened households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Urauch-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crack together: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10:00 p.m. at L 333 between Niederwallmenech and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was injured deadly.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The country road remained locked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old girl from Bornich with her car accompanied by driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion took the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealers plan "Hoimat Shoppen" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and the people of the region will rediscover shopping in the city center in September.
The business association and the town administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat Shoppen" weekend is intended to raise awareness of the customers of which offers have their own city beyond the usual supermarket wares.
Therefore, it is planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are expected to be present with their training positions.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the "middle night shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video, and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City Administration and Commercial Association cooperate with the Chamber of Industrial and Commerce.
This allows the business association and the city to go into another stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Fountain Festival, along with a dipped Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to actively participate.
Attractive Saturday offers and parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include tourists and tourists.
But many locals also lost the city centre from their sight when shopping.
In the end, everyone should help to revive the city center - to rentals, the farms of the entire city and associations.
It was possible with a network to overcome the lethargy, which had in part broadened, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK center in Mühlhausen, said that five Thuringian cities were participating on the third country’s “Hoimat Shoppen” day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Weicherode.
The day should "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," Strick said.
The action under the management of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behavior can influence his direct environment himself.
Two killed and several injured after US school explosion
During construction, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
Other people were injured.
During a gas explosion in Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the firefighters, on Wednesday (local time) there was still a wounded person in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building went down during the explosion.
A missing man was initially saved later as well.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a disaster cause, the authorities suspected that they worked on a gas line.
Only few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy during the holiday season.
Trump pushed transcripts of phone calls in Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump called on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President blasphemed him because he had publicly accused the wall. According to reports, he told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said a trade for the U.S. refugees who migrated to Australia is "ridiculous", "mies" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama government would make him look like a "dep" after suggesting a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massaker: Activists Return Racist Lynchact as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury driven through a group of rural viewers in Monroe, Georgia, and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigarette and looked testing through the windscreen.
Inside the prisoners float in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Pull him out of the car!"
Crying broke the silence when a young black man was distorted from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a resumption.
But then when a blade is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of the audience threatened very real sufferings.
Since 2005, citizens’ rights return to Moore’s Ford Bridge to imitate the night, in which two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey – were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of the murders.
“It’s really unbelievable that no one has been arrested in all these years – although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize rehabilitation.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressmen of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights.
For him, the resumption serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law persecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A judicial physician puts a bed towel over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects remain on foot for decades, citizens say the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to give their voice for the first time at the pre-election campaign in the summer.
At approximately the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm father Roger Malcom destroyed a white land owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's Ms. Dorothy and that the baby she weared was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from the prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a complot between the government and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, that had been obstructed by evidence, and that the identity of witnesses had been defeated.”
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was a voting law massacre," he said.
“You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: ‘If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you.’
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual redesign of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch death.
Their representation is evident, captivating and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because we will then be confronted with its hateness in all of us," she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve gone through.”
The samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest of blacks – pushed themselves into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-introduced overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who shouts and pushes Hester, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, go away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actor) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kickering.
"I just don't think white people said 'n' at the time."
"But," one of the other black performers joked.
“You just have to meet the hard ‘R.’.”
And exactly there the energy in the room moves, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy to get this correctly, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and pressurefully.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a grief dress, stands above the actor's bodies and exhibits Billie Holidays' grieving praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it washed a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears from the eyes.
The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, travelling to see the performance, many just go down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch death occurred, the air feels splendid.
When the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children hit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies, and flirt to each other.
“You’re not really dead,” a little boy murmures, as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona arms two of his co-players and then breaks into his arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispers.
“We know that this is not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
The audience later meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chat about the redesign with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words which the performance has left.
“It’s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you,” she said.
"What it really does with me lets me believe that the lynch is still going further," she added, "today it is called only police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The resumption is inspiring in some way, because it describes the terror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
“Whoever doesn’t study his own story, who doesn’t know his own story, is condemned to repeat it.”
"Giter Darkness" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivole scenery before giant, six-storey scenery.
The screenplay (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a road corner with Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes oldtimer parks in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil bars remind Castorf’s leitmotiv – money, power and greed – that draws through his “ring” scene.
The three Rhine daughters - songs by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmony wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess deceive Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaking a body into the suitcase and giving the Krawallo Clique in Hollywood.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent feather, surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Director Janowski are celebrated in a storm, who moderately and shapedly bows hands to the Merkel rail.
There is great appreciation for the festival orchestra, which appears for the first time on the stage - in the face of the great heat again in leather recreational clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected with excitement.
If in 2013 he had to make a pipe concert, there were five years later big joys in which the single "Buh" calls underwent.
Chairman Katharina Wagner might have been happy about this.
“The audience has grown together with the ‘ring’ in some way,” she said shortly before the DPA’s performance.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its perspective.
I draw a positive summary.
Max quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Wherever?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school on the open day.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late volunteer.
How's it?
I have done abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully terminated.
I realized for myself that it’s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, working with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there’s an insight, you can see how it’s on site, at the focus maybe also, really.
And was that?
Quantity: I gathered great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my study in social activity.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker education at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Faculty in Hamm.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
It can be done from age home to youth work - in all facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was the right thing that made me irritate.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really happens.
Unlike in construction engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of them, each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young man who has been removed from the family, you must always focus on it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fears of touch?
Quantity: I am not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but this is how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday it will decrease another 3,000 jobs and shorten its intermediate dividends by 72%, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faced.
The job reduction, which generally announced CEO John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs already lost.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company who sold his participation in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached a growth from 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide killer attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by NATO, the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosion replacement carried by people".
The statement states that all injured people are in a stable condition and will be treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s most deadly militant attack since the U.S.-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence emphasizes the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA returns decision to delay the smog rule according to claims
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has revoked a decision to delay a regulation by Obama’s government that states are required to prevent smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states accused the agency for the step.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "ozone rules 2015", and said it would show the Agency's obligation to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA’s intention to measure the ozone rules – in which it is intended to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where incuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards – to delay a year until October 2018.
A group of mostly 15 democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to bring back a wide range of environmental rules imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have led to the return of Democrats and Nature Protection Groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing of air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants community room
In the end, the decision was clear: with two counter-votes, the municipal council of Fluor-Winzeln decides to establish a community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the sales contract for the still lacking part of the land has been signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still be taken until the area belonging to the church community has been owned by the municipality, there is now no planning barrier for the project to be stepped up by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a neighbouring terrace with 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality council assume that such a community space should be considered not only as a meeting place for the residents of the senior righteous residence, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been adopted by the provision of funding for the current budget in last autumn, is supported by opportunities.
The construction is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a community space, Tjaden reports, would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent.
The decision proposal provides to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a clutch between his legs in this regard, the conclusion that both seats - which is rejected to environmental construction - and pult roof - would be possible, which reduces traffic height and makes the construction more economical.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he's going on to the board.
It’s not so easy for the community room.
Daniela Reputation refers to the many own buildings, with which you don’t get right ahead, now you refuse to get out of the window in the community room, she says, “I’m doing hard with it.”
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely responsible for the community room - but absolutely against community participation.
Behind that, it sees a hidden grant to any assets or even foreign investors.
This is not so, because the acquisition of the area is not granted any grant, but obtain a real, in doubt, countervalue.
Staiger's request to split the decision proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
It remains with two counter-votes in the original program, which summarizes Stefan Haller: "If we make the decision so, we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with Car: Radler is Slipped on the Road
On Wednesday, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car and severely injured.
As police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was coming from Hilden at 12.20 a.m. by biking on the road Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfield went on the road, he apparently did not take attention to the countertraffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a refusal car.
FC Bayern Munich has to abandon David Alaba and Thiago at the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the match against Dortmund.
FC Bayern is traveling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
The staff officers at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be increasingly larger in front of the Super Cup on Saturday (20.30am/ZDF and Eurosport) at the Borussia Dortmund Cup winner.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to refrain from David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Moreover, the Munichers are missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we are not in the best physical constitution," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Lastly, it wasn't good."
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "tough, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights draws fans into their bans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
In the Harz, the country’s first “star path” will be created.
This is planned by St. Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" comes to meet the information need of many resin visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, exercise and sports performance.
Members want to set boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations in five to six places" in the Upper Resin.
St. Andreasberg, Brownlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber would be questioned.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
That’s why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be expanded by train.
“At the star path, the viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars,” the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more than another, although it lies much further away.
It will also be communicated in which star image a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in St. Andreasberg, the highest-situated Northern Germany starwart.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly seen with naked eyes.
Since 2003, on initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Funding Association, there is something similar to the planned starworm – the planet path.
Starting from Gebhard’s hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its steals leads up to the Hainberg and to the star waiting – as well as a “outland” location in Diemarden (commune of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steals with the individual planets – including the Pluto degraded at the end point to the dwerg planet – are set at the exact distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 mm diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun is 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers.
While the light takes about eight hours from sun to Pluto, pedestrians take a good hour to steel with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to set up the most exciting box fight under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate spaces in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Federweight Champion.
According to Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision on former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five-pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you lucky.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN at 19:00.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis' climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
“I’m a former spring weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I’ve got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not so big.
I'm little for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he must move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this struggle."
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their light title struground on September 23.
“This struggle might take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it,” Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as “a huge fighter,” and he may be going to participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the three-fighting champion from Riverside looks very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you didn't want to co-out."
Garcia said the focus is to show strike, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle.
“This is the struggle that needs to be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great struggle.”
Four injured after tire placing
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partly seriously injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira was probably lost control of his vehicle at about 16.30 a.m. before the connection site Marktbreit.
The car dropped to the right into the bow, where he was overwhelmed and then lie on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates – two adults and two children – were injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left road could be passed through the accident location.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 seasonal start against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first seasonal match, with the result also, the two counter gates would not have been against Braunschweig at 2:2.
“These were two countergates too much, and we have to watch in Aue even better,” said Fortuna Düsseldorf’s defense player.
The Trinity Chain is also intended to be further optimized in the Earth Mountains.
And a gate after a free shot, the fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
“For the future, it will be so that no one will stand on the line besides Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that, even after his experience in the preparation of the three-chain, his team is better dealing with the four-chain.
"I don't even know how we're going to act in Aue," his coach Friedhelm Funkel says, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we're just in the trial chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well," Hoffmann said.
“The requirement is, but that we harmony even better and do not make so many playback mistakes in construction.”
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk after a difference from a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand up on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about an ordinary seasonal start."
His coach wanted to know nothing about it.
"I'm just judging the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be disrupted early because of a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that players from Aue may even be a little fresher, as they didn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know so 100 percent where they are currently,” said Fortuna’s internal defenseman.
Although guests go from the Rhineland as easier favorite on Sunday to the meeting at (almost) finally finished stadium of Aue.
“The fact that we have the right to get under the first six is stupidness,” says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive at only one defeat against Aue of nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from first,” explains Fortuna’s Chefcoach.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming.”
And that’s why Funkel doesn’t want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Alter Evaluation Tests Released
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Rätsmedicinal Verket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum proceedings, the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Verket) has been criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person’s age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person investigated is 18 years old or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when making x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A sceptician is the endokrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he told Metro.
Göransson, however, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is smaller than 18, in this case it is about 10 percent.”
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is going well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Building Manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Government Presidency.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the construction is intended for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete bow bridge dressed with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
To ensure strength and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 meters long.
On Wednesday morning on the northern side, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter width and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening that is also used as a path of operation.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is going.
The special thing is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the movement of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable, to which many companies are connected.
The inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work by handbook.
Besides, fish and cancers had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof Building and the Collection Weiner towards Schramberg, the traffic is one-way controlled by a lamp.
For construction works at the bridge at the Lauterbacher Local Entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 together.
The whole is financed through the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Blunder protest with German potato salad
It doesn’t happen so often that parties draw a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, otherwise it’s hard to put under a hat.
The volcanoes (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented on the Circle Day are one of the broad alliances that show peaceful flags on that day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell to the "gross campaign tackle" according to the plakat.
And well-known names bring to the launch - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who have been on site for hours before the event starts, do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colored."
Originally, the city-Picknick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now it takes place on the parking place below the Rondell - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the important organizers, is really pleased: “Great how many people have come together here.”
There is music and a lot of food, including "a German potato salad that the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially on the train station, which is just a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from AfD Volcanoefel that he has endeavored to take such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old girl from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for in Daun, but there was an absence because because of the already built Laurentius kirms there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that “we can have such a beautiful event here.”
Looking at the event on the Rondell Vorplatz, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
Also: At around 20 a.m., a band for entertainment is provided in the city hall with various speakers, including the Rheinland-Palsian AfD chairman Uwe Jungle.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to keep their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, guests on the forecast have a longer breath, but also there is to clean up shortly after 21:00.
The police can remove - no special events.
Trumpet hits trumpet
A listening to the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 a.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or just "Balkan Folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in blasm music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top norches.
Petkov Solo Trompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist at the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new clothes, Daniel Schnyder’s “World Music” is combined with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece “Exchange Suite” of jazzecho winner Nils Wogram, classic, jazz and free playing are mixed into a fascinating whole artwork.
This core piece of the program was only introduced this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: the Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart Talks About Her Bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything out," said Stewart on her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what comes next?'"
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was Robert Pattinson, who ultimately bitterly decayed.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everything I've dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristin admitted she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I never liked to be taken seriously.”
Especially below she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was 11, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, 'Little girl, be proud of yourself!'"
The public especially doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that’s upset me.
And perhaps some call me unthankful, but I don’t like to justify myself before the public.”
Governor of West Virginia announces he is shifting the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday night that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor.”
The campaign broke out in joy.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement in the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night, in which it said: “The change of Governor Justice’s party is another hit for a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 Governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and cannot find a positive, agreeing message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises “honest” Russian apology for doping scandal
Global chief of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, which he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport.
Russia’s Chief Athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin, during the IAAF Congress, on the evening of the World Athletics Championships, said that the removal of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for “all athletes who were captured from gold and silver medals in competitions.”
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted for maintaining the prohibition imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found indications of government-funded doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he is also "pleasing" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the moment to reuse Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will attend the World Athletics Championships starting on Friday in London following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
Head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has to meet some of the criteria for re-set.
Drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited coaches are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers dismantled in Mali
At a grief celebration in the Northern Hessen Fritzlar, around 1,000 of the two soldiers who were killed in Mali thought of helicopters.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high safety precautions.
On the unclear abstract matter, Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She called the two deceased pilots, however, "their specialist."
"We're nearing this highest victim they've delivered on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Staff Captain from North Hessen died on Wednesday a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their sages were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Bundeswehr Death Watch on Thursday to Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
In the midnight, only the families in the church took goodbye.
Afterwards, the grief celebration began in the family circle, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Bundeswehr Volker Wieker’s General Inspector.
Mourning guests laid roses, the family stood arm in arm on the servants.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense by der Leyen called the deceased soldiers "high decorated" and engagement experience.
The stab captain had built the fighting helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar with the flight operation and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, said: “If this occupation could not turn off the crash, no one would have succeeded.”
Doubt about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the commitment is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance “for a country from which we are separated by only two states,” she said.
After the mourning feast, the sages were brought out of the dome.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not give any information about it.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported to the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Royal Pair is buried in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophage for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hell that he wasn’t happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's throne was established in 1972, he would like to be king.
In 2016, he retired with the title "Princessmaal".
Since Henrik in Denmark didn’t get the title and function he wanted, he didn’t see himself as equivalent to his wife – not even after the death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last rest place of the 83-year-old is finally unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborade de Monpezat, son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a serious stand in Denmark in his almost 50-year-old reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knife socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gallois that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and that in this country had the reputation to be the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope on perseverance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is resigning after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick new election of the countrytag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it was for the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising exit of a green deputy from their landtags in Lower Saxony had fallen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its short one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its election circle in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
Björn Thumler, Head of CDU Group, would like to recommend that his group take it into account.
CDU and FDP have 69 seats together in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greene 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was vice versa.
The new land day will be regularly elected on January 14th next year.
Thumler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Because, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides as quickly as possible for its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further approach on Tuesday.
The country constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag will withdraw confidence from the Prime Minister and elect a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally cleanly checked," said Thumler.
“All questions will be discussed quietly if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thumler called Twesten's step "but a little curioso."
The politician himself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She called herself a trailer of black-green.
The Greens urged the abductive members to return their landtag mandate.
"Of course, we assume that they return their landtag mandate they received on the green country list with immediate effect," Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
Anja Piel, chairman of the Green Group, said: “We are extremely sorry for the decision of Elke Twesten.”
She has consciously decided not to take a debate in the group.
"Even in the background that there were no content differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemned the transition of the Lower Saxony Green Deputy Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betray.
“The behaviour of the former Green Deputies in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters, but also betrayal to Red-Green,” the Federal Head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests for the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
“It’s a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony joins this dirty intriguing game and tries to beat political capital from it.”
Björn Thumler, Chairman of the CDU Group of Lower Saxony, would recommend his members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD in the Bundestag, claimed Twesten to distort the outcome of the 2013 Landtag elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one voice in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How consumers can protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in the interview with the Editor’s Netzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect itself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping pressure.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Foodmittelwarnung.de, the federal states submit the latest information on the egg chargins concerned.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Also, if after all that we are currently known, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been immediately opened and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became aware of Germany’s affection.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade as well as manufacturers must ensure that the products sold are trafficable and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg/kg has exceeded in eggs, they are not trafficable.
Unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the farms are not faulty.
Do manufacturing companies and consumers sit on the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, the manufacturing companies do not have a direct blame.
Rather, due to alleged illegal practices of services companies, they have to expect economic damage.
As always, there are too few controllers in the emergency.
Does it lack only the staff or even the comprehensive responsibility?
It was just the official controls that have revealed the process.
The truth, however, also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
This is why a consistent enlightenment of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors are crucial in cases where crimes may exist.
I have already made clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarm really necessary for food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and traffic food.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly angry.
Through the painted means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers fall into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the posture of food suppliers is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be quickly and completely disclosed.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the CEO, which has monitored the European game, has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG has to prove that Neymar’s transfer has been funded without great losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team through the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to counter with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break-even point in their business related to football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debt on themselves in their pursuit of success were effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the focus on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP reporting period running by 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen in angry from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to strike out of excessive expenditure.
“FFP is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future,” said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a package, it may distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so that the discharge sum for the next five years can be declared at EUR 44.4 million in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players rather than the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizational Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and could be easy to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe every attempt to overcome the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, saying people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were unauthorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a revenue of EUR 542.4 million, earned a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
Accounts for the last financial year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association estimates the sales after signing will rise by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar’s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga President Javier Tebas, Spanish daily newspaper AS, told PSG about Qatar’s ultimate ownership.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s retentions against a state that finances a association.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the Northwest Switzerland newspaper on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to the current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and undergo quality control.
“We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey,” said the spokesman.
Approximately 17 million small red white shoggita plates packed to 14 grams per year distributed the flight companions before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual revenue of about one billion francs.
However, most importantly, the advertising effect is: for a schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates are in the new tender, the Swiss doesn’t want to tell.
Only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is seeking to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing the Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluding a contract with Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are conserved with leaks from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class, passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short distance from Chocolate Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discussion Olympic winner Robert Harting reachs World Cup Finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, a 2016 Olympic winner, failed in the national World Cup expulsion and could only look at the discussion competition from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s of the Greece Age (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter rolled the sketch composition "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Po.
As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and an encarnation of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking bowl of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stirring to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play kids who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the principle of casting, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that swings the weight").
At one point, a character was explored by an Apple Powerbook, some inline scatters and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the key stories are the same.
The beautiful Coop (Mr. Showalter), now roman writer, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-mallike plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s “Singles” underlife, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old snacker.
It’s the random madness moments that could heat this franchise like a sort of repeating “Seven Up!” series until he reached what I consider as his logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premier of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its eastern-counter-west ring fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighteenties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-soaked Gregor and an idealist iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags for reputation (the police spend time watching chess on television, how Americans may do with football).
And the list of the famous spokespersons - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it moves, and the comedy is not fast or common enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was written to a lower length, could deliver his agitprop satires better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginated communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a frost.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with their own.
Drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baarkreis in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Attorney’s Office Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused aged 25 to 77 were arrested and detained commands against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Simultaneously in Italy, two people were arrested.
Against the two suspected Italians there were German arrest orders.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and depression.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office has identified Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in the southern German area.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the Great Application was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian citizens in close relation to the Italian mafia were in the view of the investigations.
An incident in Hüfingen on May 27, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the account of the bands.
Manner complains big gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum proceedings.
The Representative for the Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weiss, has reported that large gaps in the Central Foreign Register were noted.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious misdecisions" in the case of asylum proceedings and deportations, warned in an analysis of the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to the report, ten million people with foreign nationality are included in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will be managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data was not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found by people who have long been alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register.
"Incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on exit-required people are included in EU citizens who would not have to exit.
Such false assignments, however, “led to a distorted debate on the deal with exit-required persons,” the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with children under the age of 16 to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is evidenced from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, the BAMF states that such procedures are "required families with children - with the exception of infants and microchildren - to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this state can send him back to the entrance country.
The office wrote: "Meanwhile, the capacity of receiving families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECRR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokesman for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Family with children threatens in the deficiencies of the Italian asylum system of non-human rights receiving conditions and a threat to child welfare."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service already provided for other people.
At least twelve citizens who were awarded Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipality council, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s great how our body is designed for it, and we’re taking respect to donors who provide their blood for strangers, even unprofit for it,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
“A single blood donation helps several people,” explained German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, as the conserves are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, cornbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
“This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result,” said the DRK leader in the area.
Obviously, the move to the theater house led to higher participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations of blood.
Half so many of Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spend ten times per 500 milliliter of her life juice.
Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation decreased speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "income" when it contributed to interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed at 6 out of 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 percent, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to little 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to control the inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the Mammut conjuncture package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from February to come, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said, "In the central forecast of the MPC, the GDP remains low in the short term as the pressure on real income of households continues to burden consumption."
Among the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain strain of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "something bigger" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that increases would take place "stagely" and "limited".
The bank’s down-corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pounds fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth rates have declined increasing expectations to increase interest and GDP increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by increasing inflation and smaller salary increases, as the increasing gets worse first before it gets improved.
She added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot "prevent income breakthrough," but she added that wages will "deliberately" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25 percent last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to drop.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s last judgment to the interest rates, the call for an interest increase increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% to 2.6% in June last month, although the bank said that this was expected and will draw it back in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess in relation to its goal of 2% was "all" to attribute to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Hypothesis Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive as lenders want to loudly search for business and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and conclude the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates become increasingly popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs for 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposition prophylax taken before sexual intercourse (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86%, is now delivered by the healthcare service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a “important new intervention” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this “decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to enable people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylax (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection-risk people.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are just enough medications in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree to the study are identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week after an international competitive purchase.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used, targeted and implemented to a large scale.
Stevens said, “This great new intervention should supplement and overcome the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity’s biggest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted towards people who are in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to improving many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement very warmly.”
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been purchased, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our HIV prevention approach and the transfer of this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it’s important that this study is carried out throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that they will help us to get a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banking woman with a passion for real estate, dropped from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
“Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overwhelmed.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a packed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor to optimally take advantage of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preference.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to buckle.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but designing the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all beasts and glasses by Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A little engineering art entered there,” explains Erfan of the stealed, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you slide the door, it slides very lightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“At the end of the day you will sell the ground floor – or how your property is appreciated,” says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on ground size."
Here they managed to enlarge the floor surface while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something default into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the province.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin – described by Paul as “major operator and the dominant personality” in the family De Lutis – owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets and about one-third of Paul.
A court states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed interviews, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but argues Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian heritage claims that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs rise in the case, with hundreds of sites with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies stores from the late 1950s and purchased a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the safety to buy the Collingwood Liegency in which Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he began Westco there when he was “in my last years high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property goodly to their sons.
"Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, “became consterned about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin was a former AFL Board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “always hoped for a solution.”
This hope seemed to be over on Friday.
“Our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict President’s media abstinence.
Others have tried it and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that falls into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow – whether on paper or in briefings – because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to cope with Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now when he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Trump was angry for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs to be convinced," former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from his trouble some times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to constantly prevent it from causing Trump’s controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting to Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - wholeheartedly dealing with this story - reported in May of the advisors' preference to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press sections, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he understands where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave to the President a maliciously printed copy of a article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for shikans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that in the past he has spoken false accusations and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, “seek to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives.”
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most sought-after criminals receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the aid of the population is requested and expected.
The police across Europe send (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals fleeing this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after heavy criminals are not naturally known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action followed by the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar of Winter.
Experiences had shown that many flights are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
There have been 21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of the online searches have been arrested, at least eleven of them due to notices after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a dive and return to the 'Millionaires' series
Some of the wealthiest house owners in West Midlands stand again with some determined travellers on the foot of war, who have negotiated a grave drawn by the municipality to demand back a field in front of their master houses.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of carriers with them after they were thrown out until May, but without being scared by a council-excavated grave to prevent their invasions.
The tactical group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have urged the advice of Solihull, who said it is "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, “You moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it because it was useless in addressing the problem.
The travellers were there in May, have been moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the council can’t even stop that.”
One inhabitants who did not want to be called, said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area.”
A spokesman of the Council of Solihull said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and work together with Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps so they can move on as quickly as possible.
To support our proof collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we will present our case.”
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is made.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently renovated and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closing of the hotel Birkenhof by the then-ambiente Unternehmensgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council Office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontested at the time in the municipal council.
But above all, Freudenstadt mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested in the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, bauschutt containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear how extensive renovation works are done.
The floors were broken out, ceilings were partially removed, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is a lot to do until March.
“It’s really a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large accessible showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built up.
Everything is going to be “beautiful citizen” later, as Thomas Scherer expresses.
“We want to make a jewelry.”
A pool, a spa area and a meeting room are included.
You don’t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Luise Waldhotel with its approximately 60 rooms wants to stand wide, Scherer continues to explain.
Both individual travellers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause has already held, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine itself.
About a million euros, he estimates.
The outer facilities are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freedom City is a good market."
Russian Affair: U.S. Special Investigator Sets up Grand Jury
In the Russian affair about U.S. President Donald Trump said special investigator Robert Mueller has set up a so-called Grand Jury.
The committee started the work over the past few weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote on people familiar with the thing.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcast CNN reported that there are already first calls from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump’s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be on several men who acted as the Republican’s consultant in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump’s private and business environment under the lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that special investigator Trump personally went to the center and investigates the charges of whether the president may have hindered justice in the affair.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges should be charged.
Grand Jurys are also called chambers of accusation.
Usually they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process is always carried out behind closed doors.
The Board can also be turned on by the prosecutor’s office to appeal to persons under oath for hearing.
According to the CNN broadcast, calls have already been issued about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisor and cousin Jared Kushner and his electoral leader Paul Manafort were in the conversation.
Law experts said on Thursday night on the U.S. television that the establishment shows that Mueller doesn’t let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly, if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on an accusation.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the board is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to worry about President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The Russian history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The topic gives Democrats a way to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.
His special adviser Ty Cobb declared in a statement he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this works usually in secret, he emphasized.
The White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "doing" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be identified.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this ruling, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to hinder the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.
It has been speculating whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urgency of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from the almost seven-fold Berlin size from the shelf ice.
This was reported by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The Coloss over a billion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers now drives north and will probably take two or three years until it melts.
It is one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered over the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
A danger for people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice cream in the region, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now broken Coloss has so far been part of the Larsen-C-schelfe.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this iron was disturbed with the balance of growth and breakdown a few years ago.
A complete scarf ice cream is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It says a lot that the Larsen-C-schelfie is also at risk because the front edge has never moved as far as it is currently.
Furthermore, the ice plate stands under tension and can break down if a piece breaks at a key spot.
Melting ice creams and ice mountains does not increase the sea levels, as they swim on the water and disperse ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf iron leads to the glaciers going directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, however, only in a small degree, writes the UK research project for observation of the Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelle is the fourth largest Antarctica's square ice cream with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more endangered position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists it was controversial whether the Larsen C-schelfie will grow again or return in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, very many ice spikes of the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken down.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years, counting to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants household tariff at the staff
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free jobs, the CDU calls out of the Employer Association to become more attractive.
Only before the summer break, the Circle Day has brought 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind.
The teaching offices in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Around 620 applications have been recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks further staff to manage the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 jobs not occupied in the Mettmann circle.
Inter alia, doctors and engineers are searched as well as general administration forces.
The CDU will now take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG during the Circular Day and counter the lack of professionals in the administration.
According to the wish of the parties, the administration is to "develop an approach to recreation and development of personnel".
It aims not only to cover short-term needs for professionals, but to counter the lack of applicants in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-seasoners and include a training offensive, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel issues that you didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
This is an actual “employer’s competition”.
In addition, a large number of employees who exit the service with regard to illness or age.
Therefore, the highest time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Volks, Chief Fractional Officer of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a faust-thick surprise during the circle day when he publicly questioned personnel cost coverage and amazed the rest of the parties.
Peoples want to review all the possibilities that enable an exit from the municipal employer association.
"If we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the cities of the surrounding community," he said.
This means that the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff regulation.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to occupational years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years.
A few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees were taking care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy increases the sound of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they are not allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs don’t sign a new code of conduct, it’s difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rescue' because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, has refused to express detailed charges by Italian Attorney Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority, so we’re sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only judge all accusations that are currently charged after we have collected all information and can judge the situation.”
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of Youth Rescue, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes on board hose boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the vessels can be used again.
At least such a meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles beyond the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s case, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian coastal guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Behaviour, boats such as the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring “essential changes or disability” to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Award Organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy had declined significantly over the past few weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have resulted in fruit.
"In the last few days we have started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Auspost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Northern Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friendly guides available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the forest and the front-line levels.
In the meantime, there were always longer increases, rewarding for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim for the saline and the Wurstmarkt Volksfest.
Once again, the viewpoint ranged at the viewpoint, connected by "flowful" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many meters of heights have been announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe in the outdoor inhalatory healing sole.
Neustadt was also attacked.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the forest from its best side – sporty and culturally.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is ready for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium races through wind and weather?
E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans, and huge high-scale tournaments included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga associations that are increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and later the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to enthusiast new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "some associations will rise on this train."
The next weekend the FIFA World Football Association in London will organize the first Interactive Club World Cup where the gamers of various clubs will engage each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen’s former coach now advise an agency for virtual football players.
“Real football has to focus particularly with the 14-30-year-olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sports under contract, you could be online more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What's exactly about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, ligues have been established in which the professionals face each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
Is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is surely customary.
Ingo Frobose also has long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports – for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and quick responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also train their body and pay attention to diet.
“The fitted player is a good player.”
But Frobose also sees problems: “Doping becomes more and more a topic.”
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports lacked.
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
Players are on the road internationally, that’s like a big global family, because there are no intercultural impediments.
A study by the Deloitte Corporate Advisory and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts e-sports a rapid growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the revenue is expected to be 130 million.
Although this is little against the almost €2.4 billion of the football club.
However, the e-sport is “no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” Deloitte advisors write.
Many countries internationally continue.
Big markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
Some things are doing in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teacher, says Frobose.
In the Netherlands and France, the first football clubs are now committed to establishing an e-sport department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison, Germany is behind," explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann.
To fall in nostalgia only, and to change the old times is no longer enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
“There cannot be kept in mind that only in football everything remains as it was always.”
Poison Eggs Ade - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
In the meantime, almost all federal countries have been affected by the scandal of gift loaded eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs should be taken into the shelves, which are evident not containing fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemned Conrad Roy for suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind grids and five years have been exposed to trial.
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at the hearing: “My family is unrelenting.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood in the eyes with tears, with hands folded and downward eyes when she was condemned.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility,” she said.
“She hasn’t shown any repentance.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible circumstance she totally regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn’t find out that “their age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness has a significant influence on their actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy’s Mother Lynn Roy, which said that “there is no day I don’t mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I work with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain we will bear with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she'd be "tracked" by the knowledge that she'd never be participating in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for her children.
“No longer having this only person I was with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in 2014 by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life.
"Stop up, jump out of a building, sprinkle yourself, I don't know there's a lot of ways," she told several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before her suicide she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for the murder of her British companion in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter earns compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning of the new mini-shell of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The Bayern FC trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season to - extra motivation does not harm there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional clothing was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were seen, he made the bond assigned to him stand on his arm.
"The trainer didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told after his first commitment as a Bayern captain.
Well, the level could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also indicate Kimmich like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf professionals, who were played by youth players, debutants and just coming out of their holidays, but he was chosen as a player.
Sugarl is most likely to be distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in atmosphere.
So those who have been chosen to act on the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich said, “This is what you want as a player: to assume responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled over the field as a mini-shell.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bond on the arm made her remaining.
And at all, Kimmich appeared in this starting formation like the one who can take the wheel in the hands of the best.
He gave instructions, trying to lead the unplayed troop.
He had a look at all while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (failed hardly); Renato Sanches with attaching to the devils to the performances of the Asian trip (just failed); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern trikot.
And then it was very good.
Sule ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli storm often became difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed in playing a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was “not as we hoped.”
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Movement, switching speed: "For this style I was also taken."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for new access, you were looking at the match afterwards.
Rudy, for example, did not have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich says goodbye on his new player's back.
There he heard from Süle an interesting phrase: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria’s most well-known footballer has registered on Twitter shortly before the match and the ÖFB ladies wanted everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and febert with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational spray.
Our ladies might need the famous Bayern Dusseldorf well too.
Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalsian Minister: Economics praises Wissings Tempo
It often became unreconciliable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region talk on T-V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time challenge the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Association (VTU), says: “Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked.”
The biggest reversal sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Still this year, the Ministry hopes a plan-determination procedure, the construction law will stand by 2021.
A role in the country’s plans also plays the western confrontation of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal traffic path plan.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann said.
Natus sees a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Industrial and Commerce Chamber (IHK) Trier, as encouraged by Wissing, seeks to enhance the sale in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sacked for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The craft chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, CEO Matthias Schwalbach says.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the master exam and 2500 euros, if graduates become independent within ten years after master training.
But the home tasks list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, it is quick to create facts, at the same time it fails to the country’s needed staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want Wissing to hire mobility at the country’s business, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court that the country invests more than 20 million euros in the retention of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of professional workers in the region.
Furthermore, the current broadband expansion in the country is enthusiastic.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the network supply in an IHK survey only with the 3.4 score.
They complained about stocking internet connections and breaches.
Former economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already granted the field again after four months due to disagreements.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter-response
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer updating the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” and referred to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralize diesel vehicles’ exhaust gases also increases, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of slashing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies attempt to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes that could use so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but returned in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be held in court in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to overcome emissions rules in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be hard to burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes overproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the flow on Saturday at Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to also participate the Isar visitors, tomorrow a fleet runs through Munich, which has a special message.
Whoever it draws again to the Isar on Saturday will see a large float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common float, with Isar tourists.
Instead, the reference will be clear.
On the floor you can see a big infotransparent.
It shows a Müllberg.
The start to a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is ..." it is intended to sharp the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow.
Last summer, the flooded over the Isar and this year, there are further actions and actions to achieve considerable and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's knots and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon designers, the knollennases of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85 years, the Argentinian still plays and works on a film.
His message: laughing, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist he hit himself, among other things, as a drawer for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my career life was the day when I lost in my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found a lot of fans.
The artist of cities has always been inspired.
Large, round Mordillo figures crawl in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he says he still sits on the table today, working almost ten hours daily.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plushes and watches, his dreaming figures continue to spread a lot worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as a counterplayer.
For the first time his characters speak in the 3D movie to come to the movie wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is decreasing because of the drought-remembered conditions and insects transmitting diseases, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to make great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zicade, a microbacterium that transfers dwerg cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts for holidaymakers, it is also very demanded for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the ground, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year-old existence today.
Highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Middle Ages Festival.
Krämers, lights, merchants, vagants or a landsknecht camp should be experienced in the city center these days.
The killing of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly newspaper employees usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and uninterrupted drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routine.
Two high-level journalists discuss what it feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: enemy, neutral, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are growing throughout the country, more and more journalists are in it: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto began his office in December 2012. 589 are under attacks and threats under federal protection, and so far there were at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
Its absence is deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez showing his midfinger with the word "justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or Panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a special federal attorney was established to address the cases of journalists, it has launched only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organized crimes every year, the killers of journalists are rarely tried.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are disgusting and although the terrain is now even more traitor.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're misconfident to all."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper’s office in Culiacan’s capital.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But about Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rivalry groups struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t mind that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
In February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalry cartel fractions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have been angry by the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexico’s violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there.
In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Northwest, when he gathered with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 stakeholders.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with Rompevento TV.
“You have to take over the task you like as a journalist – either that or you’re playing the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in front of so many dead people... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generously coating and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and landing tracks” to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-maintenance.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "A sense of sense that can be deceived...and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed, and days earlier it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself called untrusted.
It has been months ago since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug bands are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition of the state expenditure that focused on the Governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite location of drug traders and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of the abduction.
"We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his lean body table.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office was rededicated to the storage room for signs and labels that protest the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning due to another journalist to the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more noiseful by writing in organized protests “SOS Press” on walkways and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and attempts to gain international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spining and killing journalists because they said the truth.
Since then, she has asked her to be redistributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has injured her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "returned" by organized crimes, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug bands, but also by command of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with the organized crime.
The media guard group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
“You die in Mexico because they want you to hold your mouth,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head.
Some affiliates have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez directed publicly to the drug cartels with a guide article on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to sum.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as it was promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the border edge they have published the news on Riodoce’s website via phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cry nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police officers who kept the guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his traces.
"How can you also think about closeing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaur uses tarnage to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nosehorn of a Canadian mining worker have been so well maintained that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even notice that his sharp skin was red brown - and they said she had had something of a "disturbing past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best maintained armed dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Creed Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to National Geographic reports, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grubbed at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He hit something that seemed to fail by the surrounding rock on the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you’re just blinching a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it’s sleeping,” said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with an arms and resembled a changing tank, is likely to be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily painted dinosaur used a red and white clothing to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershadow, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed them to better mix into their surroundings and avoid their enemies, experts say, suggesting that they were threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully discover it.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shears and armors over his body.
They discovered the shadow, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.
Although shadows are common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of today’s live animals.
It suggests that the dinosaurs were hunted by sufficient pressure by dinosaures eating meat that the evolution benefited the wear of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the shadows of the container - think of remaining, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaurus had been exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armed dinosaurs shows how dangerous dinosaur rabbits had to have been of the creed time," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal with evidence of his life, including his conservated intestine content, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur went into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sinked on his back to the sea ground.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable because it’s fully covered with conservated sharp skin but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in early creed times.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just swing a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he’s sleeping.”
The creed time was a time when huge theropodes, flesh-eating dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armed dinosaurs were hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monsters.
The scientists whose latest insights appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was drowned in the sea after death and mumifyed in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grubbed in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best maintained armed dinosaurs in the world, including skin and weapons, and is completely from the snatch to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips ranging from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was sweamed through Western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its arms in exquisite detail.
The stoned remnants of this special copy are so well maintained that the remnants still cover hollow panels along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Stone remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right front foot lies on his side, and his five fingers are sprinkled upwards.
I can count the shoes on his sole."
In the storm: mass carrot on A8: Many injured
Soft accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carrot.
There are numerous injured, kilometers long stables - and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) in the late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured with a mass carrot.
According to the police’s first report, between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a storm, about 17:00 a.m., almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were cracked together.
The exact number of injured were not available at first.
It’s about slight to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A huge offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstau formed about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disability on the counterroad - through numerous gaffs.
The firefighters noted the characteristics of vehicle drivers who now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing knowingly you’re sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you’re deep in your work and you just have a genial thought.
And then: pufff.
If the lamb comes and wakes up an unintended flap or rips the passenger from the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing ticket control.
It is simply confirmed by phone that you take your place and thus devaluate the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“If the offer comes, let’s expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other remote traffic routes in Germany early next year," a spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" means the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
However, to be able to use them, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket – what the most passengers are doing.
It must also be purchased via the train app DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get in the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The trainers receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train companion comes to place Y at the ticket control he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to silence.
The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to use the passengers.
“Whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our train staff simply checks in at the DB Navigator himself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Remote Transport.
Second Plus: “And our employees have more time than today to meet the individual customer needs.”
Whoever often drives the train knows that in addition to delays and missing trains, ticket controls are among the biggest crashes.
Because often, but in any case, one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the card is missing or any other document to be presented.
This results in endless discussions between train companion and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the district or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet opened.
How an activist learned the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled on a post by someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweet on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis was trying to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was extended on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“This is wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.
There were pictures of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a shield with the writing: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a beating dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman defeated his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder we have used to and we can call it typically.”
At that moment I felt shaking.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 a.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?” she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn’t take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
They have to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the various layers of black experience and black constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky to give her an experience in which she personally doesn’t experience an exclaiming racism, she’s not different from the next black women’s child.
I feel like I would make her a bad service to keep her away from it.”
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place in front of the police office that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge by Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them to demonstrators.
Slowly began to adopt a new type of activism for Ferrell.
“My activism has changed totally after August 9,” she said, noting that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food righteousness and health inequalities in black communities as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "documente" what happened.
One question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different.”
Folayan had already worked with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death track inhabitants.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't anyone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking to us," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people will be depicted, because this is how I will be depicted.”
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that gathers together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
“But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black-lives matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall,” said Ferrell, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black and gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women.”
However, she insisted that “this is not an affirmative type of action” where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who aroused this energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence, though she was at the front because in a lifetime at these crossings, a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.
It describes the societal atmosphere of the area, which it calls her home, "a chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains."
From "Dream" to "Size Wahn": TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the topic hardly one.
The topic is discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
While one says to the bit gallery, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really nice" (Nicole Showsten), it comes from the other side: "Do not smoke a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Size Wahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates rely on a gallery bringing more customers into the city, of which the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone then bleeds out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmermarkt hall stands where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be completed.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farmermarkt hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always very happy.
We also discovered the measles for ourselves.
We would wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, it is also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: “Whether direct marketers are settled in a market hall in the gallery, they reach the amount of rent.
But the new project wouldn’t be very low.”
Eva Kilic: "Why Shopping Palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find that excessive.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even an ordinary weekly market here, it is more important for us to keep at least the market hall.
Because the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above all cheap.
As you see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailers.
Shame, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably still disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping center with a market hall doesn’t fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn’t fit to Bitburg.
Especially: Where is the farmer market hall to go during the construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or can the Bit-Gallery already remove all the businesses from Bitburg?”
George Marquet: “This will simply not work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall it doesn't give place thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg anymore.
When the farmer market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
Suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost unremarkably resemble - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wang-toppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst missed a 35-year-old prison sentence after making public as a secret diplomatic report on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and leading dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only about the shapeability of DNA data - the many ways, how they can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of this interpretation.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her age of puberty about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grain-black-white selfie in which Manning apparently sits unpleasantly on a driver’s seat and wears a platinum-blonde peruke - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 ‘Stranger Visions’ project.
In it, the artist produced portraits from foreign artifacts such as cigarette gum and rubber, extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look.
This was the time she received an email from a newspaper.
“They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated museums became unparalleled friends of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, just a few days after the book was released, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There are also now some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads to a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to continue to inflame the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her over-sized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic split, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we are all, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the artist’s highly developed scientific lexicon).
“What people hope to take with them is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video factory, Spurious Memories, also.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it’s 30 of these stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in hand with a free-speaking phone from the U.S. disciplinary fatherlands like King Kong.
"If they're cold on your speech, then they've won," he says.
“So never keep your mouth.”
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist who greeted Philadelphia.
"I still get the leather when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was previously taken in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings stature), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
“In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg told the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement behind its liberation.”
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunt is in progress for a professor at the Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who is searched for as suspicious after a man was shocked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrests were issued for murder for their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau’s death, as the Cook County Court’s files show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several sticks.
A community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of event, and detectives investigate the sticks as murder while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now licensed and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in touch with the UK police and willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way that can be thought of.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to meet the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities will help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time axis and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We'll complete the WADA's roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA schedule has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule on compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the resettlement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause Russia to be concerned.
“Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
One of the criteria listed in the list notes, however, that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren on alleged dopings supported by the government in Russian sport.
Mutko said, “We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In talking with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has intended to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the WADA from doping controls in Russia in November 2015.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA’s Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moves “in the right direction” to be re-used.
Aldi doesn’t sell anymore eggs
This was the company’s groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue to be assumed, the report said.
Only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have proven to have been tested negatively on fipronile-containing anti-lusion agents.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with her employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or – even worse – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There has never been consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called for people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, addressing special groups and demographic groups, offering employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allowing whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and directly contact the board.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to pursue your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company heat card that at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so that you can drive why.
Companies come to see that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, helping companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber fall in the beginning of this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and CEO.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer boycoat, employee fluctuation, and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company’s headquarters, submit a formal complaint, and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.
Now, since Convercent is using, problems previously hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed faster.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view in the experience of employment,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took it until the "social media came to their right", that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the entire capital to $47 million.
Glittern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than previously.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only engaged.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a business with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee use, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data about the employee engagement is important to the experts in the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come quickly enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relying too much on data collection.
Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard of me?
Do you care about it?
And who you don't worry about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for bruins
It comes at 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players talk on a side of the team’s new exercise fields on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these unactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real tret mill for the guys in the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings should begin at 19:15 to meet the players’ already completed timetables.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during Mora’s summer school.
They are expected to keep 18 exercises throughout August. 20 before the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he would support the NCAA change of rules, even if it adds another point to the players’ many-employed routes.
"We put this huge load on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
“And they’ve just pushed it through, they’re continuing to flat themselves, they’re great people.
I think, as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields, will not be a easy task from a neighboring parking space and the neighboring Luskin Center, a hotel of high-class, which has already been advertised with footballs, which has a protective network behind a gateway.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We’re going to use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far to think that people there rent a room and then hire themselves there to register an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good business.
But we've got security forces there, and we've got security forces on parking space 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
That's why I'm not too worried.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact check in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party fact auditors and then display their results under the original contribution, the world’s largest online social network said Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a comment on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to fact checkers that may be displaying the results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where French voters were flooded with false stories before the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of the new fact check will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“Besides the understanding of what stories of fact auditors of third parties are being disputed, people want more context to make thorough decisions about what they are reading and sharing,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and works on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was watching in a squeeze music video and was a sparkle for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaeary Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edward Ages and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014 ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he unexpectedly found emotionally.
"I only responded to the fingerprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiners," he said.
“This is his fingerprint!
And letters always smell smoke, for at the time a fire was fired because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as though he himself is.
I love archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle (“I am honest: I have a little overvalued my welcome”), this all seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenheads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in digging.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapekeepers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drinked "Whiskey and began to write."
Scotney’s intimate story is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was given full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive he described as “hundreds of years in which aristocrats said “Oh, throw it on the roof.”
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmers' resurrection of 1381.
“There is a record of a revolt that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The farmer’s uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected to each other?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater, which the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted, who scened his own burial by filling a sandwich with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sandwich was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes’ loving family of Scotney: “The men seemed to be pretty scammers, making debt and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise inheritance."
After the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämämäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been restored by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go again,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marie Caple hidden in Rhöndorf
With the convulsion of the 301-year-old Marienkapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (Tuesday’s roundshow).
Still until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there is a festivity on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
“Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action asked yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
“But we’re using this measure to draw your attention.
And to make clear that some is better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honnefer, we know very well citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
The action is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues to say.
“It is necessary to formulate a single promise that gives the city a distinctive single position.”
Finally, they are competing with other municipalities.
An average five-digit amount can be costed to the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the officer’s body.
Just like this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
Now, under the chair of the Head of Government, the five vice premiers, as well as the Ministers of Defense, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the forces in the military.
Chief of Staff General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Forces and the Navy were discontinued.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army rows - most often because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire drawer of the coup attempt.
Approximately 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup trial have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to crash a "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the armed forces completely".
Does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests in the revocation of the prohibition of soldiers to be held, the newspaper wrote.
The great purification of the army and security forces continues at any time.
By decree, Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants in mid-July, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had taken the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they purged their role as guardians of the world's rule.
Following his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the military power step by step, not least with reference to the European Union's reform rules.
Former officers say that Erdogan targetedly advances Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a notionally uncalled officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army will be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not let NATO cold.
In the Alliance, after cleansing, there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational skills are “weakening,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, cited by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the US’ ways to spend Green Cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial funds to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renew route for race train shuttle
Repeatedly in the past few months it has been discussed about the future of the racing shuttle – now it is going to be quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is expected to be built on the Morodian route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the race train shuttle in the long term, the Ministry of Transport is expected to start construction work on the track this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country acknowledges itself to this connection that is primarily important for tourism," Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl said Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repair of the route was about €2.5 million.
Of this, the country takes over 75%.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally voted, said Sihl.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This is why the schedule, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a mainly popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient people to order it regularly in the future.
The track is also strongly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it couldn’t become even crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the chestwort and the type of finger nails.
“People are funny about them, but companies deliver a lot of it, and we’ll get them even more frequently,” Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feel warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything, from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the chestworts to the type or color of his finger nails.
But it will be even more concerned, as many robots have the “personality” that would make a Stepford woman look progressively.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as embarrassment.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shame and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible,” True Companion’s website whispers.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood!"
There are many troubling aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female properties, the rape propositions when you step on Frigid (heats up here: opposing) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Its emergence and its increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain provisionally at the edge of consumption culture.
But what goes through the edge zones can be very teaching in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who boasted to have sexually attacked women.
The most disturbing aspect of the television series The Handmaid’s Tale (The Report of the Maid) are not the graphic images, the dipped bodies and the eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (while with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point when it comes to their "personality," the robots do not represent real women.
You cannot separate your companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the speech mode of 2017: service girls
Trump’s great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the inclusion of healthy understanding
It has become a conscious wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that the U.S. electorate polarized also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s relatives.
We allegedly strict ourselves to let our filter bubbles dip.
Less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relative, with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I remember in another context that it also brings significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the removing effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the gross possibility that his puppets will no longer reject us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump’s right-wing republicans “normalizes”, which at once compared to his standards suddenly appear as a concept of reasonableness.
Today I find myself infected by an active nostalgy for Mitt Romney’s urgent version of the Crazy - the dog on the car roof that 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - which both in fact happened as a very mild offence compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in Central Park, the largest carussell in the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals turn to look full of anxiety over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city won’t justify the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage – the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage pub doesn’t count – but a large circulation in northern London.
However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two years of age, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carrussell, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.
On the other hand, I was forced in a store this week to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drinking cash - this to buy something over the store table.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation in which it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the shopping house was smiling, while I made the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after a prosecutor’s appeal to a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his friend was a nightly invader hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to invoke the six-year-old prison penalty of Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too intelligent.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would be able to oppose the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-classers from footwears and Epphenhofen were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
School director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Citizenhaus in Epfenhofen on Tuesday night.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle growing up in the Chickenerhof, but will then be released to freedom.
To this end, the mutter sharp performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chickenerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it burst from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken from him cracked, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hats danced with the young gockels that were wearing cylinders to betting.
The eagle stands for integration, school director Angelika Sitte said.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cooks), it belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wishes every fourth classmate to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school director Michael Müller, who always embarks on lessons losses, and the parents’ representatives.
The chicken time is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She removed her students after two years of lessons only really unwilling, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth classes.
At the end, all students had a song of summer and holiday season.
There was great pleasure with the children.
For the new school year, eight first classes have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal detentionists was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control over the free camp and placed significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the entire season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What affected persons need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are except thereof.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have shame software,” Anja Smetanin says.
Their rearrangement has arranged the Kraftfahrt Bundesbureau (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler announced to apply to any person concerned.
If an inspection is due, it will be done in its framework.
How long will the rearrangements take overall?
“To say heavy,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on the political pressure.
“Because we have seen that car manufacturers do not voluntarily act on the topic of the environment so far.”
How long does the update take?
The equipment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW?
The ACE advises to wait.
Foreign manufacturers would probably retrieve, says Smetanin.
Is a massive price decline in Euro-4 cars now threatening?
The ACE is afraid of this.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the sought-after Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and television producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored ones.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award along with his wife Melania.
The award winner, known by progressive TV series, Lear has already announced to refrain from participating in the Gala.
The New York Times said, “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to remove them from the means – and that burdens me.”
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's townmaster, will be retired next year.
The post is already enrolled – however, suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a townmaster.
And the work is still a great fun for him, as he conveyed in the press conversation.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he surprises that no application has been fulfilled by the application profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, in keeping with the regular warning periods, it should still be enough time for an elaboration.
Since Haslach acts as a lower construction law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate degrees.
Because this function is definitely going to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But nearby citizens is important to the city and himself, says Wacker, who reports about a good business climate and good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years, some important projects have accumulated in office, which have been looking back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is safe about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, varied projects will be on the agenda: for example, the redesign of the former Hukla Area and the Niederhofen Parkplatz have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even stadium announcement is still theme.
The latter alone will beat around 1.5 million euros, "if we do right," Wacker estimates.
“Everything in everything is waiting for great tasks for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
It is designed for a city builder of large playspace.
With Haslach’s own house and garden reaction can be quite flexible to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the Old Town is under monumental protection as a ensemble, it is important to "have an eye to what fits up," when new buildings are approved, the disappearing city builder emphasizes.
The city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "at the end everything goes over my table here."
In support and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high-building) has been involved for ten years, and Manfred Schöner (deep-building) has been involved for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: “We are looking for someone who really wants to remain identifying with the job.”
Continuity is not only important for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Whoever wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of arrangements and construction planning law.
The city build office is subject to high and deep construction, construction guidance planning, basic acquisition matters, administration of urban properties, town farm with house and city garden, as well as lower building law authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway Locked
According to police, the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway transmission in the area of Leobener Road (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so heavily that the nearby goods train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime site, witnesses observed a pink-red scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbub strike," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
He or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also threatened train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lock and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement, the rail customers could also get to the perpetrators.
Overall, it is to be made of a "significant" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, and train traffic on the south train could be carried out without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had fallen out Friday morning, two of which concerned remote traffic.
The goods trains didn’t fall out, but they had delay.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of upper lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The inhealable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and in the UK, 300,000, causes stomach crashes and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
Leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
In experiments it was found that a type of immune cells promoting tolerance occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building stones of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have created a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophans had mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal miliae, even if the same system works in people.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not have that.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The dryness of the mice was sequencing DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them lacked in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid – without the bacteria – to unripe immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milky acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the triptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan subproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in people as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genious" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genious" with Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder debuted against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s 40 million pounds began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira went forward to their desires.
However, Matic was excluded from the Asian preparation tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve prior to the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He takes time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We will help him be ready earlier than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his Start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but he stressed that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for it," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US state Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole was a stamina test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New Deep Battle for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, social-democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no ill-fire from the party center, just no counter-wind from the alliance – this was the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has basically changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house are watching the events in the SPD-led state capitals with increasing scandals.
What Schulz has obtained from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep shots.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green can simply not reliably govern," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising exit of a Green Deputy has fallen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Bundesminister Michael Kellner asked the abductive Lower Saxony Green Deputy Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the voters' will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Executive Officer and Electoral Chairman of the Greens to the Editor’s Network Deutschland (RND).
"This cannot be true," a SPD electoral fighter suffers when Friday morning the new Jobs message reached the party center.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the green deputy Elke Twesten passed over to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole row of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what will happen next.
The misery began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, the companions of his time calmed up.
After the country-tag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Northern Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was then, and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel killed the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute killed the party smoothly.
The colleagues remembered tiredly in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just taken up new courage, the G-20 summit came in Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep beating.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis communication he did pretty much wrong everything you can do wrong afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been struggling for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gases and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Miced survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just that’s why, Weal has been trying to make increasingly stronger accents in the last few weeks.
The former mayor of Hannover’s effort to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden either by colleagues in the surrounding area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him, because they promised a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because the party’s internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens basically does not blame.
And Schulz didn't.
At the time, the companions are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is focused on the Greens, and above all here on the abductive Parliamentary Twesten.
“It’s unbearable and democratic, as Ms. Twesten poses her own career interests about the interests of all others,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party’s lefts in the SPD Bundestagsfraction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms. Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony Deputy.
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag Group, complains of a "undemocratic maneuver".
“The electoral will four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister,” says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election, the RND.
“Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy distorts the election outcome,” Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further promises by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Contribution funds for local core III
Anyone who wants to remedy his house in the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG city development reported on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there are renovation areas in Empfingen.
At the time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took two-thirds of the funding sum.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is important to promote internal development, not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation zone III.
The funding amounts 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a renovation area arise?
Schindler continues to investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabilitating.
If appropriate, the territorial boundaries could also move again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Countries program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of city centres, the improvement of living and employment conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out related to objects, i.e. per plot.
The renovation area was finally defined as a statute.
The period for grant grants is still running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September this year, however, the inventory records would be carried out in the framework of which the stakeholders in the renovation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the Statute Decision is to take place as far as possible so that the renovations can be initiated next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality must carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the city-building failures and deciding when it will be redressed and to what extent.
It will also be entered in the basic book for the properties.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Arch" in which it relates, among other things, to the building condition and the renovation aims.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing arch", information on the size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operation arch" is only to be filled in if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for grant.
Furthermore, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler further emphasized that the distribution of the funds functions in accordance with the "Winddog principle" - who comes first, breads first.
We cannot “reserve” funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Local Kern II" were still shown to make the present "tasty" repair.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in home and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, has implanted the tiny chip between thumb and display finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is on the steering.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi forklift.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 on the evening of the event wrote to his superintendent, the deputy commander of marine aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 7 o'clock in the morning on July 17, and remained until the grass was cleaned between 18:00 and 21:00 tonight.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was located at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit stayed on the ground on the plane during the time.
The records provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could injure the determination.
“A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this wasn’t the case,” the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
Official events also have political top tones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to prevent government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the journey.
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft made taxi services in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show Made In America - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US President of the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the month's training needs of the flight crew, an official said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in publishing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defence for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour flight.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
“Setting the costs for taxpayers based on estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD’s refund rates do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that will be made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver seat of a firefighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shared with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before difficult task
Leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga took place at the Suchdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow in Kiel at the Suchdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the top leader of the Second Tennis League has received the sense of reality.
Team Chief Marius Zay has any respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
On the rear positions, I find the team very good.”
For class and stability at the Suchdorfer SV, mainly imports from the high north.
“Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double,” says Zay overlooking Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“That’s going to be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime January.
If currently the Challenger tournament does not make an active French party to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing in the Czech Liberec tournament comes to his first stage this season.
The unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarus Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories on Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
If it’s not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world ranking in January 2016, someone fills the chair out of the coach stab around Marius Zay.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really happy when he put his signature under the law to exacerbate sanctions against Russia on Wednesday.
“In his haste to adopt the law,” the Congress packed a few “constitutionally illegal rules,” he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the U.S. assault.
After all, the draft plans to punish European companies to help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, domestic OMV investors have been concerned, who together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Line Nord Stream 2.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an estimation of the consequences, according to the official statement of the Oil Group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to raise the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his election.
"The press" has looked at what the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narco Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pushed to the focus in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, revealed by Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series hasn’t been over for a long time.
The three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali Cartell.
Led by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government rapish and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Cartell, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backwards: The City introduces 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita dinner table itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team.
In the city's children's days, the watch is turned back.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's Kitas childhood facilities.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked remains outside the house: a cater takes this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled.
In the Krefeld area, the town operates 46 children's day-to-day facilities, in 44 children gets a warm meal at lunch.
In the past kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the needs were constantly growing.
“Not only are children who are taken care of 45 hours of week eating at Kita at lunch,” Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour service when children stay until 14:00."
46 part-time staff have from 1 September kitchen service: they heat the supplied foods, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the meal out, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
“Employees are firmly assigned to a kita,” Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - decides about the range of hours.
“The kitchen assistants now belong firmly to the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for kita management."
Because it’s also about healthy diet and cooking lessons.
“Children should help prepare food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is meaningful.
Also for the children.
“They have a well-known strength in Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms – also the task of the kitchen forces – will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, which it has shown itself as the most economical in comparison of costs between self-employment and foreign loans for the city, the press office said.
And this, although 46 part-time forces are redesigned.
“But these hours are not so weightful about 750 people in the education area,” Sonja Pommeranz said.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidated in the Council elections in the provinces; three women will be candidated for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5th.
The Taliban has published threats against a election process that coincide with the transition of international battle actions to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time the elections will pass the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3.6 million registered voters were registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried to rape a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police reports, the men talked to the 13-year-old girls who stayed with friends on the Kolping Road at around 14.55 a.m. because they wanted to call the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the phone and necklace of the girl, but it failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure the long-term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow is among the managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company has focused on the future of investments in the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea Keks alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "the first" experience if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie’s called on “to express remembering that financing is not advanced for the modernization of production lines.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce focuses strongly on the local community and the larger Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in a area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, rising costs of living and chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The company at Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, are continuously reviewing our businesses – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production facility, and if our operations are changing at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this.”
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not decline in her persecution of Neymar after she delivered an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record invasion?
The sensational approach heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1-club is ready to break the world record to more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board insisted that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President of this perspective?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, this will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti early this summer.
PSG made clear that they would not allow the International to leave from Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown over and damaged

Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is writer and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to be discussed.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reform Movement "We Are Church", told the German Press Agency, he expected an excuse from the former Regensburger Bishop and today’s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Domkapell Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their at the time false assessment of the acts.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticized the reporting of violence in the domestic patterns was measured with "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful actions" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but it is noticeable to be the "degree media manipulation," says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethical Committee.
“The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” writes Scaraffia.
In the interview with the Bayern Broadcasting, Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said: “You like to go to the church and that’s a meal found.”
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "slacks were a normal educational means" to "deal with crazy kids like I was one."
If you find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Incorrectly, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,” Hesemann says, “because all this had nothing to do with him,” he evaluated the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the Bishop of Regensburg attorney Ulrich Weber?
In total, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of attacks "with high plausibility" between 1945 and early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In general, it is possible to say that Domkapellmeister R. has in many cases applied forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more violent.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even link positive memories to him despite violence.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger he believes is relieving the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the “accidents of violence in protective commandements at the Regensburg Domspatzen” gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became often handheld when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you consider this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages of a long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.
Only eight pages have been dedicated to him and he is clearly released from any suspicion of counterfeit or companionship in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violence excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of action.
In any case, one can accuse him of having learnt too late or not having taken the first suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "resolution", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the wide majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also expresses a very excellent testimony, describes him as “warm”, “popular”, “true”, “competent” and “comprehensive” as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, keks and candy and was “ever surrounded by grapes of children.”
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to anger eruptions.
That he not only knocked with chairs and threw the keyband on the ground, but also distributed earshocks and pushed too crazy boys to his hair or ears, he himself added, deeply regretted and apologised for it years ago.
For his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in parents as well as in teachers in the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you also know these methods of punishment?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnastics.
Compared to what is actually concerned in this report, namely the deceitful sexual abuse and the excess of violence at the pre-school, these are, however, bagatelles.
So you are wondering whether it has to do with his renownedness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell upon him.
Many people who have never understood it are still eager to work on the Pope of Bavaria.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot has been reported about the topic of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen related to the report.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be borne in the final report of any engagement or cooperation with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not clearly.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domcapell master.
Even the parents were not opened.
"I never tried to talk about it to my father or mother," said one person who was deputy for the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The true problem of sexual abuse was, and yet, that most victims are silent from shame.
If they didn’t even entrust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who, yet in a professional way, would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.
How do you assess the Domspatzen scholar's role of Ratzinger in terms of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A pupil interviewed said: “At sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I also think it’s really absurd to assume that they have opened up to him... fellows of intrusive or clearer or even rather than to their parents, internship leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable."
The report concluded that “the fact that students and/or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation.”
As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore freed from every community.
He cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the display.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these opponent crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "walt excesses" was read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is indeed the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
This is, however, an abuse of the report.
Indeed, it is clearly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of domains, between sexual abuse and violence excesses, and, once we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, which is also four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The entire terrible teaching, the cases where boys were actually scattered and painted by sadist teachers and under them were terribly suffered, all of them occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where they had to have really scandalous states.
But the Domcapell master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he had the boys to face until they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
As most witnesses emphasize, it was the theme "pre-school" tabu.
You were just happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisic" conditions.
What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was no discipline, but there was no sadist violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that “many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combined positive memories with him despite violence.”
This remains the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported about the states at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just began to establish himself and from the operations at a school he was not acting and responsible at, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears from the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out that "the punishment will continue to be practiced in the pre-school."
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed when punishment penalties were prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone of us probably knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons may be overwhelmed or dramatised and where the permissible boundary had actually been crossed.
But you can’t say he’d always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980, the punishment at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prins Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are talking about the "fall strike of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was hateful at all times, and not to what was broken in the pre-school of reproach and violence against innocent children’s souls, that is already far beyond the usual at the time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally worked up.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. earshocks and pulling to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was prohibited, he also strictly held it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger played in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of punishment also be addressed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells him from his perspective, where the Domspatzen played only one side-role.
However, I don’t suggest that he led a strict regiment there.
However, this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of absolute discipline, it would probably have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With keks and bonbons alone, you’re now not making up rebel boys a big singer and stand for every success in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and hearty people whom you cannot imagine he could suffer from even just a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspaces still today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family.
Those who have not forgiven him until today that he was once strict towards them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Today, most Domspaces are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music.
And that he is always a good, father teacher - a strict father, surely that may be - but he was also a lovely person to whom they still look at today and whom they just worship.
And please, once again, clearly: all that you claim to him are educational methods that were at the time on the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is very unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sin buck.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the state would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen finally in peace.
