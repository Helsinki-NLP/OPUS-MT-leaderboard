A Republican Strategy to Hinder Obama’s Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy for the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this last a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die due to a lightning drop.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is true: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And on that same line, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made it difficult for the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the scrutiny, and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal background.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hurried to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, the authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to note that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people in the age of voting, do not have any identity documents with photographs issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's even more.
In many states, students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004 no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly seeking to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two in three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of people and groups to create a help service to voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters dropping in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while they represented only 13% of state voters.
In the case of the Hispanics, it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 percent of the electorate, represent only 46 percent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. prosecutor intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the electoral school to achieve the presidency.
It’s too early to affirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the scale of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is true: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you do the test or do not do it?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is a reason more than enough to doubt men, either reticents of themselves, about whether or not detection tests should be done.
Does it test or not?
We asked for advice from the experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a large rate of infections among sample groups was detected, so it is difficult to interpret that data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with follow-up at the age of 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% of chances of suffering from metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary for the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treated prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which case rather to choose for active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have been detected cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk for their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining accurate criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of illness
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms the health of people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful date: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they added.
Feed
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Scarf products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for smoking, drying or salad can lead to the formation of cancerous substances.
“They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insisted on the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each one with his doctor.
"Making the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs's boson in detail
The announcement of Higgs’ probable discovery of the boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And moreover, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not completely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data disclosed this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seems to confirm that yes, although there are still more data to be completely secure.
Anyway, we assume that it's about Higgs, because the chances of misleading seem few. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate that norm and do not attempt it too much, because it will end up harming.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, largely, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the Bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the boson of Higgs would be somehow related.
These bosons, I would like to emphasize here, they're not the exotic bits we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes steering, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone to a pond.
In this "disorder" there is an electromagnetic wave (of light, of infrared, of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "strength carriers" bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it needs to reach extremely high energy, a little as if it was a ice pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
Therefore, an immense particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) needs to achieve such energy levels.
Analogy to the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can they contribute" all these investigations? asks Ms. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
On the other hand, many fervently wish to find themselves, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that taps certain holes of the model.
This, to be said, still has huge deficiencies, such as it proposes no explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms around 80% of the matter of the universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impacts of such research in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are misleading by saying that we will not have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the labs did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle already said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, the laser was at first rather considered a "laboratory equipment".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle itself developed a light captor in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intent, this captor now serves as "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which he earned the Nobel Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but it is never known...
Paliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In his Death Commission in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon while a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I already have seven so," says, done a passage, lieting in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he came the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused you to ruin: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating for yourself.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, you accept resigned to help you eat.
Daring, even smiling, talking to strangers who devote her attention, bring her medications and offer her a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest desire is to cure me from diarrhea, it's humiliating," she says.
A few hours later, the team found remedy for that evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man stands up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Back to your childhood, for certain people, is unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offer “healing” care.
The biggest fear of Ms. A., 89, is to die "consciously and drowned."
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
“There are no longer any wishes left for me in this life,” he says, before accepting that a mask is placed to help her breathe.
And expect, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
They are palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a paliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s very little, because we know we’ll all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center’s doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Mouthwashings with brandy or Pepsi are offered to the dying man, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday thing.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois days go without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragicly, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois arrivant center come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to relieve suffering when a sick arrives at the end phase of his life, whether at home, hospital, or at a care center.
And several organisms, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the home-based palliative care society of the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative lack of health care in Quebec which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting proceeding with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she says, “I’ve seen a patient spending 14 days in Emergency suffering great pains without being done what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get proper care."
And parallelly, many oncologists stand up with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Helene Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left exhaustive chemotherapy treatment.
“When she told my oncologist she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that it was very sorry she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of sick people who ask for dying thank their caregivers for not meeting their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home at Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to paliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the chance of having that paliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to relieve me.”
The completion of this report has been possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canada’s health research institutes.
Large-amplitude real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political parties fund collectors and Italian mafia specialists day after day count on what they know of a formidable "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiaists.
A "industrie" that went too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system sprays once we've hunted the big media," Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of Montreal Police, ironizes.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation on road contracts related malversations in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister Jean Charest had consented only to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, illegal financing of parties and corruption between officials.
“Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation, only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” he said, containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already dropped two mayors,” he added, while hoping to “demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interventors, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau Squad" police officers, who have since 2009 made Montreal's "squad card" moderate when inflating contracts.
These last weeks, the unit has carried out a series record of allegations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accuror and Lino Zambito, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montreal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s party.
M. Zambito distributed money to this and sinisterly during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
She also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for former Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of charging contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprisant, an ex-engineer of public works, perfectly explained it to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for climb contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% in terms of false extras.
Moreover, an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately making a fat sight of a parallel budget and filling his arches of dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, he has since 2010 opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to real estate promoters.
70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she says she threws "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrena and fish the guilty."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning the wounds but it would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert that doubtful practices don't repeat.
How to do cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is mostly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians to the current stratagem."
Estimating 70% the share of dirty money that was designed to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, it ironizes: "I have been told that this is just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but that won’t change the donation, he says, “while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It recommends a complete review of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: “We cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story hits the international picture of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh in the mirror.
“The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would I explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness taking, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Advancing from day to day alongside her.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes quickly in football.
But I'm not grateful.
From my beginning at INF Clairefontaine’s pre-formation center to my step through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed to actionable steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Oh, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comfortable conversation with him.
I just left a series of injuries.
The trust it has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first part of the season?
In the League 1, Lyon has taken us the position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have ranked ourselves for the stylish eighth finals.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league in front of the Porto so that we can receive the eighth final turn.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
It has already the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At an economic level, the PSG is handed over to its means for that project to be concreted.
Not winning the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we’re going to invest all our efforts to take that title of champions.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we had a disappointment, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux struggle for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media is expecting more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still meet with things to blame us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to rank for eighth finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the invested sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage on the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can tell with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's better say we've got a "Zlatandependency."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and puts many goals.
He came to show that he is the star of the League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has passed through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men who have around him.
What he has done is really exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to progress.
How did you live the 2012 Euro Cup with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and left reinforced.
Today I’m able to play good matches in the selection.
That’s what I expected since my baptism with the “blues.”
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is because today we have an exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have for the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the "blues"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the classification group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the selection to Brazil.
Did the empate (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to set the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fighted for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t lived a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopoles, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equal to equal.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a way of payment.
The bitcoin quote, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before re-rounding the ten dollars today (the quotes are reported on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or purchased (and even occasionally exchange).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositaries of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes contain in the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
It is a stage of piecing files, i.e., transformation of a large file into a shorter and single numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "twice" the assembly.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of assemblies of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain orphan, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are dividible up to the 100 million, leaving a broad margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in calculation power.
The life of the network already has its highs.
Websites that offer bitcoin services have been attacked and stolen bitcoins in deposit.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money whitening thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Actors such as Wikipedia refuse such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Insit in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins did not circulate.
In November, the "gigant lows" were launched.
"$30,000 were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book about that currency, believes quite in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a non-contact mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain in anonymity.
The system is easy to start in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It’s enough to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who seeks to have thousands of users.
There is a general review movement of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he said.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must leave in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to re-possess its territory and for the Afghans to choose its future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the injured and mutillated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee heads in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviet.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if the jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekians or Tajikians join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which was observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to the French credits, was done in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attacks, watched by the helicopters.
There will be no flow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurity of their peasants exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahidins, the current government and the current Talibans share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making themselves with government grounds to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
There will be a job for those young people who will not want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager to mobile phones. The TV and its Turkish brochures that present a modern world have great fans across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations, however, the United States has wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the planned elections in April 2014.
However, his country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been arranged or important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing occurs except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a ruined country after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor of Afghanistan possessing immense mining wealth was expanded.
And that did only increase the feeling that the Westerns were there to take over them.
Without energy to remove iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the immense Budic location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country widely dependent on imports and exports, restore their normal relationships.
French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girl schools, children schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to attempt to "win the hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of local mountains.
These works, goals of obtaining local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased growing surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military expenses?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in those valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters of height.
The Embassy received dozens of written claims with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something farmers have told me that they wish, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid and to come directly to them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or none of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional statement, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He captured everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And almost two years ago Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embroideries.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "traiting his word" and "pisoting the right."
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to quicker end the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days a referendum should be organized.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimation while the controversial causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that resort has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote my text or keep the full powers," powers that allegedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent, Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not go to the call.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional statement, they had closed the door because they believed they could not make their views apply.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, replacement members, had been added in the early morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As I could expect, the voted articles have been unanimously.
On the other hand, commentators are grateful to the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day had been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent’s clock was wrong.
The text, which last night was still being voted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 object of all sights remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the primary source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals tackle it as hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising damn.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers to Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce is not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we look at the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawmakers who have worked on this text are not ulems but universities, some of them formed in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, as the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be asked in the future would be to what extent civilian judges are competent to pronounce above all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms relating to the extended powers that it confers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflictive point: the powers conferred to the army.
According to the military's desire, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil proceedings in military courts will also be prohibited, as the human rights associations requested.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they considered liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could bring serious consequences to freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out on television last night, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
Participants of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the globe of the world and a salt sea
The Promised Earth combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a prestigious nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, the walking over the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers here walk the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Pain").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorium, where the trial was carried out, and continues on the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unity, and the place of Jesus’ burial.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the 70 AD.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Massaged Fortress were what remained from a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And getting there by their own means can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historical summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large flow of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain allegedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are around 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings it has canvas from impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and batheers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or shops of souvenirs.
The entrance is free, and categorically donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bath all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lower point on the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salt water, salt and healing mud and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of ancients
The old part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, retains them on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that carry the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "the same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find new married couples coming from everywhere in Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, King Herod's city, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "to take" the fortress of the crosses.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to desire: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the High City.
In fact, it's a underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts your work.
But on Sunday morning a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only serves kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, non-scale fish and dishes where milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of cow and lamb meat-based dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are grilled balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs seen.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their taste" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Ronators love the riding places and do not reject the goals.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it leaves for $15 per day.
And renting a bicycle will come out for 15 shekels on the day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to travel the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8,000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% at the same index of 2010, prior to the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for your tongue
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law on mandatory examination would bring, they have already appeared in the timer country trading with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
As of 1 December, a law enters into force, according to which each workforce immigrant must conduct an examination to verify his/her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to give up the examination of the language, unless also that of Russian history and that of the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language are exceptional.
People who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examiner centres will work outside the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Peoples Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present tests in all cities, now in Russia are open to more than 160 such centres.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law entered into force, managed many times to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will bring the compulsoryness of language knowledge to both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First of all, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many people talk today about the defense of the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or have medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be convicted of finding non-scrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid journey" to a stunning and narrow covach, where he and dozens of others like he are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive, they are deprived of their passports, they don't pay them the promised wages," confirms Tajikistan's Immigration Service's Head of Labour Immigration, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, chief!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misery: few Turkmens, Uzbekians, Tajikians who can give themselves the luxury of receiving normal primary education.
This is because their families even don’t have anything to eat to the children, because they don’t talk about dressing them, shoeing them and buying them whatever they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys are adventured to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if the language is not known, they recognize.
"One feels humiliated and lower."
However, in terms of language law, rights defenders point to an important point.
Exams will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If you do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or prohibited to pass to strangers"
Many visitors say that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false enrollment can be made quickly and for only 1,500 rubles.
Employees of Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
“They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Tajikistan’s citizen Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Come on, don't be thick, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Law on Language, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been captured by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomats" cannot be purchased, converge government officials and rights defenders.
To date, authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully spent the exam the first time more to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is fairly reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes more rigidity to apply the law with respect to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government’s reaction to recent incidents: To press shoots during wedding celebrations in which there were no victims fortunately, and the massacre initiated by Moscow’s lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which To press seven people lost their lives.
Police aim to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for the obtaining of license for weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the arms possession law will be taken to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone feels happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "tough hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organisations of shooters, demand that such measures of “meaningless rigidity” be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism acts using recorded weapons is minimal, Russian BBC news service, criminal attorney Vasiliy Lésnikov said.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, for six months of 2012, 142 offences were committed with firearms registered in internal bodies, compared to the total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that more strict legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal heading to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapons can be found at low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior claims that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black weapons market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High State.
Website screenshot accepting weapons orders
The first, "army or military test", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and the same Caucasians,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", they stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that the stolen weapons from the police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials are included here.
Illegal weapons leave for sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are demonstrated versions that some fires were premeditatively caused to cover the lack,” a former military said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“Now private weapons factories have spread that are not competitive in the international market and distribute under-strong weapons to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert said.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine makers come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” the former military explains.
Where are the weapons from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal weapons supply to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal library and public access data from portals whose theme rotates around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons has arrived there “by the guilt of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where armed conflicts exist, 14% of cases are stolen during weapons production, and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the weapons stores, who asked his surname not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators haven’t been buying anyone for a long time because they’re too old.
More often, it says, suppliers are heading to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some cottage, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the registry and pass it above the fence.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two loaders," he said.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so regularly, when the crime discovery plan must be met, they make test purchases to illegal weapons traders,” the dependent adds.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer often find themselves through acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the Begovaya platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "squinet" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I heard only there.”
Military commentary Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the store dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to come, let's say, "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that a tooth of his daughter had fallen."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to deal with him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was prepared to publish an article on this topic.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
To the buyer, according to Baranets’ words, they don’t offer cat by lieber: everything there can be proven.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
“Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure that the weapon shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, no document or personal encounters are required.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the advertising “Buy a gun or a metraller.”
There users ask their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conservated orthography).
"Buy pistol TT. Moscow," laconicly asked his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures two-hand those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the ceb, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment via a cash machine.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," NGO press secretary Dmitri Kislov said.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without gun and put it in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures two-hand those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the cebolin, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In purchasing illegal firearms, experts say, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms," a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half month should be expected.
It is sent from military warehouses by mid-range chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives fell by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are striking.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashmakers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in the Walmart corporation’s supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald’s”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave comes to the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and step up in its early stages.
Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a series of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the objective of the organizers of the protests is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, the rebate orgy that captured millions of inhabitants was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some Walmart corporation workers, employing 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside left union and activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at people with modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
Availability and product assortment have made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can allow himself to sell products at very low price, partly because he pays little to his workers.
These latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountain loads or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" demonstration participants demanded the increase in wages and complained that the health insurance cost provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts wage increase on consumer shoulders, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to comment that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its stores from Thursday afternoon 8am to midnight the next day and during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers performed the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the Huffington Post left-wing website that they left his job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had only been “another PR trick,” organized by the union of workers.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not precisely the large Walmart warehouses (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and for that time there is none), but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick down and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, in accordance with the federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wins less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers spent through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this wage, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if they don’t know what to give them to eat.
Participants in the protests, who began at 6:30 p.m. at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue Thursday morning, demanded that fast-food cookers and cashmakers be started to pay for at least $15 per hour, i.e. to double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the fast food sector workers unions be created.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent this right and punish activists of the trade union movement with arguments and resignations.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to board the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordants
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council member, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then doesn't even give you a hospital nor pay for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other senior New York Democrats, for example from Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity deserved by each New Yorkers.”
As the newspaper New York Times described, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were fast food service employees, in which dozens of thousands of New York people worked.
It is still unclear whether this will be a spark to cause a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy."
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology fans, is lately perceived normally primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Google conference, it showed a moving model and later, in November, it was found that Microsoft had also filed a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamon, it was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They attract the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the study object of your research group?
- We devote ourselves to person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its large mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else for the future?
Although Kinect has led the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design.
The world must be released from computer technology to ours, to the physician, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those foolish helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, you are pending to solve the privacy issue, as you don’t always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of loose, but shorter movements.
Furthermore, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- I.e., you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good deep resolution, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have complaints about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only resolution in the X and Y axis, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of pictures per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, made a 1-100 ms adjustable processing delay contact sensor and it is important to mention that the modern series-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects man-machine interaction.
To me would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that doesn’t require contact for the pictures per second to be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is indeed the infrared ray emitter and the second the signal receiver reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible slide sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a Kinect flexible analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Doesn’t you think, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in the hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from the glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that’s your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark from the Iron Man movie, but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch answer!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh inruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of touch feelings.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support quality for the image.
Register the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays targeted to a specific point where the finger is found gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing in the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence the nervous ends of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems should feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here there is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes work with virtual reality attractive for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the St. Petersburg Vanguardism project, dedicated to citizens in front of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements come beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even Russia knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from upstairs downstairs, whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inauguration.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardism of St. Petersburg in the late 80s - early 90s.
Furthermore, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and raises all the mood.
Recently, he took an organillo in his hands and became St. Petersburg's organillo, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you going to the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red color because I am fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, the imaging creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggressiveness and agitation of no good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- At an exhibition of the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensive.
I became a friend of the new wave artists, with the post-exposed artists in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and the new wave is already over.
I went into the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for the letters.
And all this gathered in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the St. Petersburg Bohemian house.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and his friends were singing light songs under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was encouraging many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our helpful employees and customers.
I’m a hero from the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was carried out in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something recognizable in your jobs.
Many of my paintings are hits, in which it clearly expresses the current and occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I was previously society, but now being so is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is embarked and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one follows the clothes, orienting themselves into the outside, but not inside the person.
And perhaps that person shouldn’t be given his hand, but spit in his face.
And deception will be removed when it changes clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organisher. - A cult city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, having touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people grouped into cows, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplities.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 banknote to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, there works the sex-social sphere.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything will drown.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young, he did such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now, concepts often confuse.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money only to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
Kirill, what's missing St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right, everything was otherwise, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed because they need experts at a higher level to properly assess them and open their way.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same thing is Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's for you St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is ground.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is small.
We have to make the art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project will be executed with a St. Petersburg grant.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of human spacecraft on board depart in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species under conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says Chief Researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on Venus’ surface the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address reproductive problems in space with flora.
For half a century, experiments have been carried out with plants.
Four generations of strawberries cultivated in orbit did not differ in anything from land varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small flights of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, cod eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
As a result, we get a normal pollution.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this polluter has to find support, must keep on his own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
As they didn’t find support, the polluted chickens gave random returns.
And after 10 hours in newborns a total atrophy of instincts was given.
The polluted chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the unfortunateness was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we managed the polluted chickens to be born, but then we leave it because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the polluted chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" fled to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel one-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space with fetus.
In principle, nothing surnatural was found.
“This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have traveled to space for 50 years.
The highest risk was given by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our fleet flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” said the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights all happened well, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if more can be said, it’s dangerous even on orbital flights,” the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov, summarizes.
However, humanity must look for some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
Under conditions of null floatability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates gravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment, for a newborn child is his native element.
Small-anphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within her mother in the amniotic liquid, as it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the birth moment to the first bath time only spend 2 weeks.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if gravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the strength of gravity is necessary.
In abdominal and pelvis muscles decreases very quickly, the expulsion capacity of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, trusting the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asked this original question.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear it in a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment we’re going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will lead to bringing us to Earth to a disabled person, a totally inadequate person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
NKÚ Head: Inspection of the "Švarc" system has not given the guilty politician
In the field of public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is covered.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) says in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we miss," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the system "švarc".
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb entrepreneurs with inspectors, so is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor require obligations,” Kala says.
At the meeting of the control committee at the Congress of the Members, you spoke of the joint draft between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started performing about two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public awards should be organized, follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have joined everything and, although control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the enforcement of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this type could help us stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reducing and improving boundaries, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of reducing the limit of the awards means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper", that those who want to seek failures in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the boundaries remain as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in a different way?
As far as the offices, such as the NKU, work there the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a little different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallel.
Also the competences are to some extent analog, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
Usually, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data, however, Germany remains a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely clarified what it is best about.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of the inspectors?
That surely doesn’t, but I repeat, I don’t like doing this type of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't give you any benefit to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
As for our country's legislation, what meant the amendment to the law on public procurement for your Office? Is it somehow manifested?
Bearing in mind that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we have ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", which has passed nearly 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the boundaries are modified, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are corrected.
Does it consider that the endorsement of this law is beneficial or rather is an embroidery for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "have hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the above regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each unrespected law in the field of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this started path takes us.
The Prime Minister recently declared that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system, with reference to the fact that they are self-employed only on the paper.
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister of the Government cannot prevent the Office’s action that has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you cannot say we will do as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict in terms of how formally it should be acted, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for failing to meet formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we miss.
The roads have ice plates, although mostly they are transitable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most pathways are transitable, in some caution must be extreme.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and oscillates between five and ten degrees below zero. The thermometers will rise slightly during the day.
It has stopped snow in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
Instead, in the crests of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches nearly 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to the information from the road operations control center in the region.
The fast road R6 and the first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, caution is recommended, especially at some bridges whose surface may be frozen and sliding.
Also, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still tracks with ice remains and stitched snow.
Attention must be increased on the road, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some Eastern Bohemian roads there is danger of ice cream and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports the Road and Highway Direction on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger that ice plates are formed, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can be produced near Lanskrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is especially snow on the roads of the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a stitched snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually swing between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the region of Pilsen are transitable today in the morning, although the precaution must be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be freeze, temperatures will vary between three and nine degrees under zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent decline of temperatures, some pathways may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region's road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted to be transitable, although it is recommended to examine the precaution, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most high-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area border with Germany, there may be sections with ice plates.
Second and third category roads are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice-plated frames.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less traffic routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be encountered with partially drained snow.
After chemical treatment, he still remained snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; on the Šumper road, about three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most routes are unrestricted.
“In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter mid-snow driving towards Jeseník,” a road administration operator from Šumper to ČTK today confirmed.
On the ground and at night, their colleagues went to the Jesenická as well and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now clean and wet.
On the Olomouc road, the roads can be transitable without restrictions, on that of Šternberská the drivers should drive with precaution in the forest sections, where the roads remain wet.
Ustí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Northern Bohemian road operators have reported complications at different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snow or ice cream, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures remain under zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and the roads, usually, are dry.
No service complications have been registered by the instance.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surrounding Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected to melt rain and snow, and at night the sky will be clean and there will be ice.
Since the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many alarming news that we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group we rather like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to bring up enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-of-the-art beneficial act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10.
The day before, on December 20 at 21:00, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time when the Maya calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea come up with?
Initially it was my idea, then we were all forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wishing to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called hymn against the end of the world, which is titled "The end of the world, canceled."
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can you hear it in beneficial concerts?
Of course yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will simultaneously link to each other thanks to the special live broadcast on the Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where she also sings Xindl X.
How did this collaboration emerge?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We put our entire efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun to work with us.
What will the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world be allocated to?
The equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkov ústav.
Students at Jedličkův ústav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay for teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We attempt to develop a program that will be attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned another similar “spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not so difficult how it can look at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged it well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is no longer surprising me.
Even in Moscow, from which we have returned recently, everything went out without trouble.
Thanks to exit abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a lot of way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not frequent that a person moves alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in wheelchair in elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civilian association has been established that strives to thematic the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take an example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people you directly affect.
In London and Madrid, it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move in public on their own and can go to the service, the museum, wherever they want.
But it’s not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap, let’s go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when it comes to the time that eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers arise, it will begin to really change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great will.
The The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we looked at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedličkov ústav, where there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophon, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator Láđa Angelovič says, we got a little bit of our hands (laughs).
However, popularity has not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work you don’t see is as if it didn’t exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to teach quality, equipment, etc.
Did you want to get so far away with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something can be done otherwise.
The world of the show is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept itself.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then it is not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and their head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lađa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people enter and go out, you cannot avoid.
Whoever has will and wishes will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through video conference to jointly sing The Tap Tap group's song "Fin of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to fund the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO education center without barriers in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, whose costs amount to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry to the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth ESA member. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern Europe block, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the later years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already dedicated to flights to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left indifferent attendees and, years later, Šternfeld reminded that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Award and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to the Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the hidden face craters of the moon.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland that would be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is unclear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
The information about this drain is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
As of 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslavem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research came to the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohziński and the following year was published the studio "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of military missile techniques and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, for the first time it refers to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautic Federation.
He performed this charge until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM probe (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was conducted.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was finished and in the summer of 1959 the air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the desert of Błędow.
The rocket was 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was going to be a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the height wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built in 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were differentiated by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version were later built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law of social labour.
The resolution awakened a warm discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited private capital movement, along with unfreeded financial speculation.
The effect of major differences on the labour cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, attempts to shorten distances and for that "leads to a drop" of the competitor's price with the aim of making the most of the market and thus increasing its margin of profit.
On a large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, thereby, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily grows.
This entire situation leads to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their efforts to gain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is evident above all in the changes to existing laws.
The objective is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the economic obligation system in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted employee rights in respect of labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with increased differences between poor and rich.
For a number of years, there are in Germany food delivery points for poor people that cannot be kept with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of aid is already a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: employees with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the necessary minimum to survive.
A scandal of this type related to the situation of the German federal parliament’s auxiliary employees was published.
The savings of almost all southern EU states lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressed by an abismal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to malfunction with a bad wage at the border of society, with the hope that someday they will reach the private investor country.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media state to the saciety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering into control.
Then, it is necessary to wonder whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in a legislation that is virtually reprobable everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of laws to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.
These types of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like that describing Appians in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long disintegrated and the administrations were dealing with force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the urns with the vote opened in advance... "There were no people with character aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consules..."
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decline of the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be seen in the unfreeded liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, in waiting for the next coup.
The truly demolishing fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech Republic government will be forced to continue searching for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Not comes from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his Fragile song and whose stribillo prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (Let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none," Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death bed in 1849.
After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right to self-defense and encash the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and tackles Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are regularly repeated and who is the victim; after all, today's citizens of Israel, including autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to give readers a look behind the screen, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been drawn for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small Middle East land surface.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on my own way of understanding the matter, on who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of struggles for power is in the first row.
At every time we can find a Great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always the ones who led their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who led their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been able to reach in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t dismiss it): the Rothschilds.
He doesn’t write much about them.
Of course.
In the nineties of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have significant participations in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or is preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were seven countries, after the attack of Iraq were five, after the defeat of Gaddafi only four remained, but in the meantime Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their aim for world power led them during the 1859s - 1871s to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with Degree 33.
The first war was marked as a goal to eliminate the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially Britain, and the third wanted to reduce the population of the earth between half a billion and a billion people (like an absolute number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion and ecum.
The method with which the group of the wealthiest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening situation. If not, remember that the EFD was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 is not repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando in Sarajevo and after that the First World War triggered, Tsarist Russia destroyed with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiedly from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end the Zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground of World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covered manner, a conflicting situation following the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, which created the optimum pillars for the radicalization of the impoverished German masses, and then they basted with serving the simply Germans with the Führer's signal.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds driven the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspirated to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour statement laid the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
World War II: It is difficult to know whether Hitler dropped too much from the rope to which international bankers had tied it at first, or whether everything he did was part of a plan, however, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimum conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany led the path to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now along with the Arab population or generally Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only in the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let’s take an example of how Israel’s sympathizers and detractors are tacklely divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where is injustice created injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their aim for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
Today’s president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to declare war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to be a global conflict of navigation and, if we take into account that Iran controls the near of Gold.
Under what light the words David Rockefeller spoke in 1994 are now shown: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip when born that controls his whole being.
And it forces all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark in their right hands or on their foreheads, to not be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in the forehead, let him add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Movie Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
Their release was going to be in exchange for the destroyed Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: pulling shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if so, it endangered the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not in its reach.
It was a blow to the prestigious United States, which subsequently intensified even more with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
Incarcerated diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algeria government.
In the U.S., their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran decisively contributed to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" of director and actor Ben Affleck theme an episode of this story, which coased a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy occupied, six employees of the building were escaped.
After a complicated periployment, they ended at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help an extravagant story covered: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan drawn by Toni Mendez in “exfiltration” required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society had even a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez’s memories.
The Affleck movie is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The movie combines mood. We found on one side well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credit sequence shows iconic photographs of the time of events, which were drawn in the same way in the movie; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And furthermore, scenes from the CIA central and other institutions: men dressed who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has no longer been the blank of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long film, after "Adios Little, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first movie in which the action doesn’t take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy take is impressive by its synoptic capacity, which at the same time transmits the excitement of the disconcert and lack of prediction that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn’t come so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at the Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America, and the unfreeded search behind his track becomes madness).
Argo’s weakness is the uncontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s movie loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it’s a movie that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes in the 1970s.
But if it falls down, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as a proof of how exaggerated they can be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services, it is enough.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the rules or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“It happened to us after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies,” said the survey organizer Pravo Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women were advantageous for better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which results in damaging the environment; another ban is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of the egg cages, which has contributed to the considerable price of this year.
The factual ban on using the term "unting butter" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself saying that it is only intended to harmonize the unhomogeneized national standards so far, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription last year according to which in inflatable balloons marketed is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death due to asphyxia.
A similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia. In order not to injure Greece's sensitivity, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food provisions in a member state’s territory.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry to the EU.
Then the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for conserved arrows, which was a threat to substantial fines.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of ideas did not emerge in Brussels but in Prague.
“We’re in disadvantage of the fact that we don’t have sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,” said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued it with the fact that a lot of cereals were produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had the full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that don’t have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is aimed at drafting Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the member states are often critical, the EU's regulatory efforts and more effective operation and development across the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also touched by the sensitive fiber, just as other countries in the Union, the struggle for the right to denomination of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious of these pugnas.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of the Olomouc requeson, but had to change their name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and went to be called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillation can be called ron, but not those made from sugar beetles.
In the official list of EU protected denominations, along with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Pohořelice and Třepulův carp, and even Třepulův variety.
As protected EU tides, you can be proud of Pardubice’s ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší’s barks.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you think you were presenting to the presidential elections?
It is not about being Senator or President.
If in our country it was all right, then I wouldn’t submit my candidature.
But I can no longer bear seeing how it is stolen in our country in the last twenty years, how thieves remain unpunished, taxes and retirement age are increased.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidature is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present myself as Senator or President.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly afterwards it has been on the way to the presidency.
Isn’t you turning back to those who have voted?
I have always said that my candidate for presidency depends on the results in the senate elections.
Later I prescribed that if I left elected senator, I would file my candidate for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realise my own ideas.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as strong mandate as possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we are footing anyone who wants to start a change.
To this is added the media, which dispredict you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
It is said that I have borrowed journalists or that I have been advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle is presented with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
For this, the law must change.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to resolve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guidance to be recognized as autonomous work, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, is intentionally rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without casualties or match dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from every match that is best for our country and apply it.
Are you rather considered a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more than left.
It’s not important to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters me is we go ahead.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG, and in the same way I will be against bad ideas.
It makes a joke when it is said that you are populist.
But isn't you demonstrating it with what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be people call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament there are only signs left.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, achieve criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimate criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character that points to the disputes, you can make pressure on the political scene.
Let's take by case the direct election of the president, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I am just an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to take things ahead myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, within six years I will leave it and return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that's why I've visited a number of known personalities, if they might be encouraged to submit their candidate for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but she refused because she had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself from the basis that people are really unsatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the urns and, those who did so, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering to form your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time to do so, to check the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor have I money.
I have no money or for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Do you have no money?
It talks about property statements, how is yours?
I put my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of artworks with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and on the count I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was galant with women, and at the same time fighting evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and doesn’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money from your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to debt myself?
In the campaign I have already placed 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that there is no too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive as a senator salary.
For example, I couldn't pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t present myself as a candidate.
So will you continue with your business activity to live?
Didn't you say before that I was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher wage.
As I promised, I have left my activities in part.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would like it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much is it used to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I was president, then I would leave business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly finished "book mountain" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a cross-season who goes through the street.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: “In addition, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody's tastefully entering those past fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a flightful visit, has the doubtful honour of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago, it was decided to somehow contribute to general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of armed concrete miniatures decorated.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: it was necessary to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, whole a teacher in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time as cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was looking at a perplexion around him and covered his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Concitizens:
Here you have my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called ‘Boekenberg’.”
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of houses and apartment buildings.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated to the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way, the small city lacking history, which so far had nothing more than offering a post-modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly municipality behind whose white facade one would rather intuite a milk center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massive, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but they prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the sight, the reinforced brick floor and elegant lighthouses unmistakably support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By lifting the view you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Usually book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that usually is somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is putting up the classic space configuration and putting out the reading zone from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are offices, the internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall coating, parapete and barandilla at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civilian engineers more a day strike their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that’s like one day, in a Frisian farm, we covered the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of scarce millimeters thickness is used in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This thin tissue lasts two seasons and then removes.
For the library, this fabric was first pressed in such amounts until it achieved four-inch thick irons.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells to a mixture of new car and sports shoes.
After 105 stairs it reachs the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch crockets and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere that maintains atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it costs to believe it because of its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid, even in the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden shelves located in a cross-sectional direction to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is thing of the automatic trays.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic worker in the Information Technology sector, has dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, and she qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that on the occasion of the inauguration a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book of their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill up the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its full file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been silent.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in that reign discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and hidden it might be.
Finally, a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather peliacute diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier the week, Germany said it would vote against the proposal to grant the status of the United Nations observer state to Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Due to the special relationship that connects the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I think it doesn’t support the US position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, getting away from a policy led by the United States, and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a consistent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are on a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do so.
I think they’re still looking at what their role will be, but they’ve already started the path towards a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What specifically means a "normal" foreign policy from the German perspective?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend different positions than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other major powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not alienated from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance as it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, German posture enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in Libya.
Perhaps Germany has achieved a certain respect.
Ultimately, all of this has not done but demonstrate that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference in opinions between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed due to US internal policy.
I think Obama’s government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I think the true difference in opinions does not actually have the range it is attributed to.
If we analyze the relationships between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is for nothing excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they don’t have the chance to be part of an upper entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That’s exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I think Germany will take a leading role in the future in order to force Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a peliacute topic.
But I think Germans are clear that they should play the role of independent figure.
Do you see Germany in the role of an important international actor? Do you actually wish Germany to play a protagonist?
Or maybe it’s still difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it continues to cost the country to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a leading actor, certain anti-German feelings disappear.
This is not easy for Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European policy is increasingly decreasing, but the EU does not currently cover that void, then who remains?
The Germans will not be more remedy than taking a more protagonist role.

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Became Chinese Brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
After this name an officially registered name is hidden in China but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it has protection while the true eponyms do not make a demand.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports items Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive in which he guards seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested registration of the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served from the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.
However, the cases of Pattloch are of a different nature. On the charge of his customers, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to benefit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or a companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
“It’s harmful to business, we have to fight against it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears, and the damage the image suffers is enormous.”
Financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors affected are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year China is, in size, the third luxury items market and growing at the highest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of doubtful enrollments in trademark registration is complicated and also makes a lot of money.
The processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had passed so long that the name subject to the lawsuit had already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff has bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiator because the process has damaged the plagiator’s brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a blank and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the matter was addressed in courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction of the original.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staff.
Last year, however, "the working emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were solved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are amazing.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it means China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for tenth consecutive year, the brand office said.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been paid for duties.
In other words, this means that on average each enrollment costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrates the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been struggling in courts against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacturing of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We have caused this situation ourselves because in Germany surname is not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the recourse of the Municipalities.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg has given the reason, but the opposite party continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident to be able to resolve the matter favorably and to praise the professionality of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the enterprise file has had to review files of up to 100 years old to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite party a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly deal, but it failed to succeed.
“This shows how much we care about,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
Specifically if the imitators secure the rights on unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
For a long time the group left this trade area, yet managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights legislation, but what we have to do is “record everything that may be susceptible to protection in China too,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can be much more expensive than just a record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World Day of the Fight against AIDS: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi choir tries and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are rejoiced
The story of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, tackle shoes and mocasins looking for the compas on parquet floor, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then they begin to slowly rise the voices of the singers (contrailt, low, tenor and soprano), crashing down, stumbling and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to leave almost his boxes when trying to order his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir tries a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a hardly known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations Programme for the Fight against AIDS, around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found in Germany patterns for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can appreciate a child.
This contribution will cover school enrollment, uniform and guarantee a hot daily meal at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "history narrator" or "pannegirist".
In this room nobody can speak fluently this bantu tongue, but singing you know.
For ten years, this choir has tried songs in this gentle foreign language that it sometimes can transport them to its place of origin: southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers straight away from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Fourty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw, many of them are children.
More than 300 have no more parents because they have undergone AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to half the risk of infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at some more than thirty years of age has become something usual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this population, but what they mostly saw were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothes and training.
Without school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
One year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial origin ETS include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common TSEs of viral origin are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Strips and sandwich are between parasites transmitted ETS.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more commonly given in men who maintain sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four in five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomon, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (mushroom) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory statement.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a veneral disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as bumps or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and that is why they are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens may also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if you are often changing a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, finally but not least, fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they get to raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini itself, a woman secure of herself and with leadership equipment manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care of the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the elderly women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their office, offer them a roof where to live and take care of children going to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone are under Khanyisile’s protection, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a wage from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has achieved many people undergoing HIV tests.
This is not something obvious, since despite how clear this disease is throughout the country, it is often not spoken openly about it.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the spread so quickly that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporaries who travel the country from one side to another and who take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "Any corner can be obtained free preservatives, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa singing songs speaking of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to break out a pair of tears to someone other anger border soldier.
The trip always leads them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the appointed children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River valley is very well known.
"Come near Esitjeni, there shines the light," says the people of the place.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight away back to Heidelberg to the Bergheimer street test halls filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water, as it emerges from three studies published Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet permanently in the shadow.
It seems to be at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably coming from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one relates the find of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, said Messenger’s chief researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely unaware for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the inany planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the hardest thing to recognize is the pink color of the "new born" stars.
This region of star formation, unromanticly called by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This image of a star in extinction was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star splashes in its extinction process.
In the enormous Triphid Nebula, at 5,400 light years of Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object at a simple sight in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the Aquarium constellation.
Its similarity to an Earth continent has validated the surname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image leads to a spectacular colorful.
This star could be captured in all its splendour for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknown astronomy.
It’s probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without leaving trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most sharp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remote Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousands of light years in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the candle heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic shell: at 400 million light-years of Earth the cores of two galaxies in fusion process are balanced towards each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the surname of Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula there is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, also continuously emerge new stars; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this so bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suppose it was formed shortly after the big bang, when it could be found above all hydrogen in the universe.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are increasingly deep.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope is raised.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its huge ability to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, that capacity is equal to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radiotelescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer by providing processing ability.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also light up the middle infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sends images of far-away worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope is looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The picture sees the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers leave the basis that in the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there are no fair evidence, as the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the northern pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure that it is.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan many people achieve biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.

To the south of Azerbaijan many people achieve biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great stroke through the sinuous road that passes next to forest hills, rivers of high flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it’s in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a village of which you don't know much, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijan and who are very long-term.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town presume of a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the eldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded the age of 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white picture.
This is my grandfather who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136
However, the unquestionable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no evidence of birth that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 sons, and apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter older at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the old age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very older people,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil records either.
Daily glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many older people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems not logical that precisely the calorie-rich food of the talyshis, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a glass of melt butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it’s the natural lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole region of the Caucasus.
Sitting on the floor, it moves tirelessly a huge butter pin.
Eight people live under a roof, among them one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play from one side to another two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea serving in typical boiled glasses.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the sleeve hides two long trenches of dark blonde hair that your son discovers proud of us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, so I’ve never fell and kept its colour.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and grass.
In my whole life I never got to buy a supermarket.
Then he tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after World War II.
However, everything went back to his grip when the "dear father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the worship of the nation’s parent figure, who leads its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness ceded to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobras 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s child is right: “In our culture the elders are very respected.”
They live in a great family, are beloved, receive all necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution, the term “human rights” is missing.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division in which the country is missing.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not scatize in pathetism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, disappeared without remedy until now in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily cancel the jurisdictions of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "to be able to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to deprive your power of judiciary?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft is also said that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does that mean of "principes"?
This was and remains open to interpretation, and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver it takes, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
It doesn’t have to be like this, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the disability of judgment.
Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it aims to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its moral and values.”
This is an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly is nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or calumnizing the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
The same as doubt is the formulation that prohibits “offense to people”
Is a president's caricature or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
“The Revolution has come back”
For weeks the opposition has been closing rows against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the lists of presidential elections.
Nobel Peace and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft of the constitution should be “in the cube of the waste of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “state coup against democracy.”
“When he convokes the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said opponent Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, our brothers’ blood has not yet been expiated,” the opposition politician Chaled Ali said in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced they did not want to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim community made an appeal to celebrate a counter-manifestation; for instance, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the cry of “the people demand the enforcement of the divine law.”
They demanded Mursi to “clean up the country,” at the same time they proclaimed: “the Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and the supporters of the constitution would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide in the urns which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of Islamists has the most guaranteed.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and have included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were in prison or had to deal with a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he regrets in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of Mursi's competences to the three powers of the State caused the lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,” Saeda said.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
Norwegian Rakfisk: The world’s most harmful fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has a relationship with its longing for an extremely poor fish?
Take a number of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of the rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisite aroma.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is truce in salazone that is left fermented in water during, depending on how disgusting you prefer it, up to a year.
As it becomes darker and gets cooler, Norwegians go into a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to say, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of a drink aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a huge amount of drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty knocked Norway and in which, before cooling existed, fish was stored during the fall immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is rapidly increasing; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even does not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part of the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A beer rod or a sandwich cost you the cold of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still little willing to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the event of July 22.”
The Norwegians are hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Following a lot of the wealth of Norway today, there is growth, since the early 70s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re going so well,” says Anna, our warrior, while passing trays from Rakfisk and who, with her long blonde melena and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like praise, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that it didn’t have during the years before the financial crisis worldwide, Norway kept the wallet well closed.
“While we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” Anna says.
"And eating rakfisk," he adds with a carcased draft.
I'm in the snow doing tail to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But in the evening, he returns that bad fish.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated in which the dinners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A television has live connected with a carrying bird shower and surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applauses.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe they are the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While Mexico’s coming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his position, BBC’s correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad currently.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congestioned by itself, a steel lock has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation’s management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already been taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before coding with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña’s pre-political experience was as governor of his native state, that of Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; the views on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A honest man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are remembered with affection.
His residents attribute him the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city you can drive by one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bach-filled roads that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern polysport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We trust he will be able to make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of Mr. Peña Nieto’s Party, the PRI.
“In particular, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country needs so much.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was debanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Member Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party towards Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating the opposition lacks essence of the new president.
“He’s a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
He’s a fantastic man of state and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the rocky streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, the intervention was requested by the military to assist in the fight against drug bands operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a waste landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that he could not address the problem of feminicide while he was in office.
The most critics accuse their administration of making their eyes fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana suicided in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed like they had cleaned her body," she recalls.
"There were signs that it had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says he’s been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I was an old sparkle, an agitator, a complaint.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that it is quiet.”
“But that can’t be like this when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope it will be the same type of president that was when he was governor,” said Olvera’s member of the PRI in Valle del Bravo.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City are most afraid.
Bradley Manning did not denounce ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Attorneys try to deal with Bradley Manning’s allegations of abuse during their stay in prison
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
Defense wants the case to be dismissed based on Manning’s imprisonment being severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest dismissal of confidential information in U.S. history, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecutor carried out to Manning in a preview of trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein claimed that the records of weekly visits of Manning's officers received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which was carried out during a view following the request for the defence that the case was rejected because its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already supposed enough punishment, came one day after Manning had witnessed that he had thought to suicide while being detained.
Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while in service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials had completed after visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in a maximum imprisonment regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and written their answers.
When on Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment that the cellars gave him as “excellent” and the treatment received at the facilities in general as “very professional.”
The forms show no claims of ill-treatment, although officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these issues and had indicated that they would be addressed, but they did not leave the record of these issues.
“They were writing ‘no incidents’ (after talking about the problems) but this doesn’t necessarily mean that I wouldn’t have mentioned any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intent during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his move to Kuwait, where he was retained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered himself suicide in Kuwait and once lost knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world declined only to the Arafjon Camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that once he moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a coat, a blanket, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if the cellars couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer filed a formal claim on Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement that, after having been forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked before the cellars and other prisoners.
Manning had witnessed that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the cover during counting.
During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said he deducted by the order he gave him the cellar that he should drop the cover with which he could have covered, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his clothes to get self-injured but that he had not done it.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from his cell his underwear, his clothes, and his glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he spent during her stay in prison and dramatically reduce his sentence in case he was sentenced in the war council, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning declare guilty of minor crimes and defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of enforcement to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
Accusations against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully leading to the publication of information on the Internet, leakage of national defence information and theft of ownership or public records.
If he is convicted of all charges, he could face life jail.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remember Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely descended by the explanate and arrived in the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the path towards two tails: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
As I grew up in California Central, I have been called "Mexican" throughout my life.
It’s ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends call themselves “Italian.”
Later I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the tail of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week when elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries meet, it consisted of: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was looking forward to talking also about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he adventures to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in the style of the European Union in North America.
Furthermore, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of revolt.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to give up half of their territory on gun tip.
But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, at the time when an U.S. official says anything that brings the least criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about anger?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descendance living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point of our genealogic tree there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or some of the grandparents, to which he was closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to move north.
And most often that person fits into a particular profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and they are loyal.
Mexico no.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is clear.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the leader class we do not like.
The feeling is mutual.
We see as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their way of view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn’t find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but yet as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when I was a child, reminds me that there is this spray between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know more solidly who they are, and in the seconds this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either of them.
We love listening to the Mexican group The Northern Tigers, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted on any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I have heard myself during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexico ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That's not going to happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with the inequality of wages, galoping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the U.S. for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still angry about how they treated their families much less long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who first began, many buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
Arab spring has left everything they like or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uprising.
Perhaps this makes your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that your deadly deadly situation might dissipate.
A war that is neither lost nor winning
At first glance, optimism seems to be very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21, this week’s clashes have reinforced the halcons of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite that Gaza has received a good strike.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting Gaza’s 1.7 million inhabitants under pressure in one of the world’s most miserable and populated corners, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its unforgiving rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favour.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissant regional power that had previously been the nearest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, and has also made it Qatar, one of Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
The exultant members of Hamas say the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Military Party dominates Hizbullah, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where the Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, in difference to the most populated and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist who cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the contrary conclusion.
As for the military issue, they have put Hamas on their site.
The Israel Iron Summit anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever before; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicidal terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite that, according to international legislation, are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the prior election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why mimic those turned Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really rule on the West Bank, would they not shoot rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good hit if they lift their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire cease is a good audience and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dust that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population is increasing.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic tax.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that preach senseful people from both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel’s transfer of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small short-term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impulse to other people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop arms entry into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967 border-based Jewish state, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote her attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about smoking risks and body parts with illnesses appear on green-out boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrap of an olive green shutdown, scary images of parts of the body with illnesses and representations of children and babies sick to be children of smoker parents.
Except for the various images and health warnings, the only difference between boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the brand names, all printed on a small type of source.
It is the most strict regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamour.
Trust in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% of chances that he will never do so.
“It can be seen that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes won’t too much affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted a huge pressure against law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will bring serious involuntary consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that China and Indonesia’s counterfeiters will bring to sell it in Australia’s streets.
Other people say their business has benefited after the law adoption.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claimed that the demand for pillars and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired from zero almost two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal of law at the Australian Supreme Cour.
Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social media between the demographic sector to which the plan is addressed.
Following a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sports sponsorship and that force most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has been performed online.
Australia has prohibited advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and just remain this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be,” said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from “foot citizens” published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It can be wondered if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has been taken the disturbance of making a video or if any marketing company is behind all that.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry focuses more on what new regulations involves than marketing.
The industry has even reached to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, although none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO will probably dict a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considered to apply harder laws.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The photographs don’t affect me.
I simply don’t listen to them.”
"You take the cigarette and save the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in your mouth.
"Safely, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack stain in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult to place them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
“The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it’s right, it’s over and we close the shop,” he says while raising his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little bit.
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are increasingly more academics and child development experts who praise the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it’s fine that both us and our children are bored from time to time.
Bowling forces the brain to look for interesting choices and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boredom brings.
So, should we accept boredom with good mood?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But we will talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I supposed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, a Greek and Roman History professor of the University of Calgary, Canada, says, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there is graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the I century AD.
We must also ask how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very diverse ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published investigations and raising the idea before a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wishing, but not power, participating in an activity that fill you.”
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn’t do anything but wants to do it.
It indicates that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to have themselves.
Sometimes we think we are boring, when what happens to us actually is that we have trouble focusing.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape from a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the room next to a full-volume television show that had no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to focus, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, alteration of attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not bore.
“In fact, we currently know that moving or making snacks, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“The research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be silent,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotone speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people tend more to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “boreness trend scale.”
The scale includes issues such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotone” and “there are so many things that I’m interested in that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys are more tending to bore more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a kind of group that get bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human Development and Community at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was in contact with 400 teenagers and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored while they were at school or doing their duties, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would be bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know whether the current boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be superior or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches his highest rates", largely because both children and teenagers are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, led to the extreme, it can cause us to expose us to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling in the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as the research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the way the brain has to tell you you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is most appropriate.
If you’re boring and use that energy to play guitar or cooking, that’ll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you short-term but not long-term.
“So if your child is bored and gives him an iPad, it may not be bored anymore, but he’s not learned to entertain for himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dosage applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but learns to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be too critical to him either.
Our goal should be to feel comfortable from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a too boring and disturbing desire to relate it to something worth it,” he says.
It points out that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment in which we are constantly overestimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise ceases.”
Colorado: no instruction book for new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and football player in Southeast Colorado, is facing a criminal proceedings for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that used it to smoke.
Orozco says one day in September, he and some friends were driving Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a judicial quote for possession of drugs and related items (small offences each carrying a fine of US$100) that he was informed of the trial date.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the holding of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug holding depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession crimes are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district prosecutors have committed to moving forward with open cases for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of newly authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who take care of the rules in the state of Washington are also turning around the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of licenses for production, manufacturing, distribution and sale, all before the deadline arrives, on December 1, 2013.
They say that, for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states as to regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what it could work.
“There is no real precedent that serves us as a model,” he says.
Washington’s law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
Furthermore, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be solved during that period, such as maintaining a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “suitable access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of performing cannabis businesses at a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be harder to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Aurora’s chief of police, Oates, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop prosecuting judgments for mild faults of marijuana to people older than 21 and that the police would stop charges against those crimes "with immediate effect."
Police chief Oates said they would comply with the city’s regulations regulating marijuana growing for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and vendors.
In Weld County, North Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has the obligation to file court proceedings against those offences that were crimes at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on legalization of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to reject any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think it's wasting time in keeping the law comply until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure, it was never considered to bring marijuana consumption for recreational use into the government and judicial system to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state demonstrate a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused of marijuana possession and who is local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to courts that they can’t actually accept that it’s legal yet,” he said.
Being the first states that consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it is alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases at the national level as to the legalization of drugs.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still anticipates the consideration of sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana have hope that the Department of Justice will cede.
Although some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors have occurred for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated shops for recreational marijuana sale, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, despite it will spend about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to approve next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we allow someone and then have a serious issue at federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town hall.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted to vote in favour of what the state voted."
Many questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been harassed until I've been thrown out of Oxford for being a Tory"
It doesn’t attack college students by their views only now.
I don’t remember any time in my life when I haven’t been dreaming of getting a square at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, at the two weeks of occupating my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the History career, I had already made the bags, which triggered the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disappointed.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had abandoned because I didn’t tolerate some college fellows maintaining sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I was forced to drink in dizzy cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled there.
Yeah, I fled, because I had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbarian: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe you wonder what this is coming to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right center students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the Conservative Party is such in Oxford that last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights that homosexuals, disabled and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of the JCR (degree student grouping) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the equal opportunities committee of their college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary named "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Right, Brilliant) on student policy and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neonazis.
He showed postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, looking at a silver costume and a rod with silver handle.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by introducing higher enrollment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a dominical newspaper that "there is an increasing left trend in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, claims that this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and OUCA elected president, claims that the attitude of JCR members towards right-wing people has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate as well as to the well-being of members,” he said.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hate to the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris cause" after cuts in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the early days of the week of welcoming new college students, when new students meet and know the doctors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that the professors were not only making a fat sight in front of the moffa made of the conservative universities, but they were very willing to participate in it.
The policy of the mining strike, the privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa came to the wooden rooms of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the 18th century to English and I was not prepared for what came below.
"Miss Wyatt," said professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give one.
Pitt, a lower man with a face that looked like bitch mass, knew how to expel bad bile.
“Is thatcherists refuse to learn French or is that they simply are stupid?” he asked.
The other universities laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I tried to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I returned to my room like a soul in pity.
That night I sat alone at dinner at college; then I felt a slight slope on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that this is how the thing is going.
Whoever suspected of being Tory, they're going to be.
For me it's very complicated, but you know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newcomers seem to be Laborists.”
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly dissimilar.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who paradoxically had studied at Eton said, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They're beating one another, isn't it?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me just after evening?
Would I have to be laborist and suppress my natural trends?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, Contemporary History Professor for my college.
They hated him because he was not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher’s advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just out there.
He hated the place he considered him a provincial and insignificant, and for his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I started moving from Oxford daily to my parents’ house in London, finding shelter in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mindset.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said with sadness.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to shake.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you leave it.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had undergone pressure and renounced his faith.
The next week, during a seminar in which another History professor had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "old stupid."
The treasures lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the cash of my college career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was closed with key.
I was inside cracked out of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors dropped.
When they left, I took the bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, hides behind a no-deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apoteosic that brings together more than 130 high-sewing dresses created by his "house" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the column of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without his distinguished customers.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most granate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophys of his social rise: from humble fashion from the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off the collars of their pits on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful pop music celebrities,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertainment with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to her chalet in Gstaad," explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, playing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charism of the fashion.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at your floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and feeling his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Sewing Week in 1995.
"Never goes fashion because their designs are artworks," she said.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour gateway of sixty meters that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk through the gateway to contemplate a "hearing" of dream that looks like Valentino's masterpieces, as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Onas.
In that audience of maniquis reluctant names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion, 2006
Many of those customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” said the ex-duchess of Fair.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he dressed a Valentino.
When I was teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting age and the opportunity to be able to wear one of her night suits.
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flight skirt, "corsage" draped, and screw a word of honor.
"It was a dream made reality," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrate living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dress with "the maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s bride suit at her wedding with Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as it calls the fashion to its sewers) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl encrustations, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the high society."
Obnubited for years with the elite's "savoir-être", now Valentino is his best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-range distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of its clients.
"I have always drawn attention to its refinement, its calm, its pulver and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Count Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of me.
“It was impeccable, time isn’t going on for him.”
If a princess says it...
The hardest work in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health loading 70 pounds of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their job is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
It is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who gain life by drawing sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do so, you have to descend every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that emerges from the Earth’s bowels is solidified by entering into contact with the air.
After breaking large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 pounds in total, carry them into two bamboo basks loading on their shoulders through scarping stone paths.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to rise by turtles, keep the balance and measuring with temptation their steps to not slide and fall through the precipice.
They know that any transpiration could cost them life, as happened to a French tourist who was spent years ago by the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn five cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur that they extract
Once up, the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys are opened and, tiredly loading the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has situated a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better to say, its workers, to whom they pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then sells it for 10,000 rupies (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture crayons, artificial fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to white sugar.
“As usual, we’re loading 70 pounds, we’re taking about 46,000 rupies (3.8 euros) on each journey,” Anto, who usually performs three daily doors, explains.
It takes three hours in each and finishes grilled, but they allow you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupies (167 euros),” said the carrier, who previously worked as a squadron on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupies (6,2 euros) a day and the tax was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people near the volcano, for a weight that, in Indonesia, is as contundent as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I have brought her to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes difficult, constantly coughs and its eyes are irrited by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing three on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pay his bill despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
It has asthma, breathes difficult, constantly coughs and its eyes are irrited by the toxic gases that dismiss the volcano.
It’s the price you need to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two years more because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," she promises in English more than acceptable.
Punited by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a roommate or a hotel receptionist, but instead does the job of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other carriers, it wakes up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn’t stop running at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater lighting up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load sulfur basks on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its sophisticated benefits, the mining company has not machined the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and weight.
In fact, they don’t even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) recharge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for beasts and not for people,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old furned carrier for three decades since leaving the school.
It’s able to raise up to 110 pounds, assures that it will endure working “all you can” because it needs the money to educate your three children, aged 18 to 10 years old.
I will not rejoice, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although sulphur burns the throat and sparks the eyes when the wind changes from improving and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the kne and wrongs on the shoulders.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only load 50 pounds at his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues draw 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away from a goat road between the weeds.
"I will not jubilee, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," she proclaims, opening her mouth well, where she lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world’s hardest offices: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress, and cost of properties and education for having no children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we comply with our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem inveronymous that these verses are part of an announcement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bowl) in the oven" to laugh from Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the advertisement they’ll get attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music in order for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
This is purely the internet, so we had to do it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don’t we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity licenses and shares tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 – known as a replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporens have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a broader range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marrying and building a family,” he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increased loneliness, and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy is an end to dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abundantly barely dressed against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who criticize for maintaining low wages and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest fees and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a solitary lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” are sold far faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new norms give clearer guidance to developers, to whom they were previously struck if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with the Singaporens working in the center’s financial district seemed to have no much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and also education, so many people are postponed it,” a young executive says.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” another 20-year-old says.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, however the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans are those who have the last word.
The private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, it is about the private quality or "the scope of private life that is entitled to protect against any intrusion."
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your everyday life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilation on the Internet situations that you would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys aged ten to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term to "something very myself", on the personal level, and "on the key and user name", when applied to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t go up to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” he says.
In FB I upload beautiful or game images.
I also entertain with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that’s not mine, or someone who’s doing the ridiculous,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he meets the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just getting them up," he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to far-reaching relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
No doubt to answer that I would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I would not listen to someone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager owns open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to meet 20 of the people added on his friends list.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his house or his phone number.
"If they press me or demand me, they would simply take my account out," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not outside of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded him money.
“I never knew who I was,” he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just put it privacy."
Then explains a number of steps to securely set up the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would pick up photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do it, if I fell wrong or I wish it.
“Even though I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a English teacher and a bachelor’s degree in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and teenagers should be understood that the purpose of social media is to report.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game,” he said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy by the Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, builds these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them when we’re still learning,” he says.
It notes that the subject is complex, "because we are asking you to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread, publish, or say to an age that maturity doesn't give for that."
"Also be selective when what you most care is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach kids and adolescents privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"To tell them that they don't do it doesn't help," he added.
Below, Fucks lists a few options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag holiday pictures, have you asked other people to permission to label them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you are doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“An outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be on social media,” he said.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read awareness of the policies of social media.
By understanding each of the incises they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of “do not talk to strangers.”
Summit of Unasur without publishing the Declaration of Lima
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendees.
Ephe attempted repeated opportunities to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellorship and Presidency pointed out at an initial point that they would deliver it after the closing, but then stated that it will at some point be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
In consultation with the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only, in the press room, the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast with the message "private, restricted audio session".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmans of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media requesting greater data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronunciation, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently required by the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which they had previously announced, was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international appointments, Peruvian authorities endeavored to ensure that there were secured transmission systems for all journalists but limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Hague Court that leads a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional appointment and ratified that they will respect the decision of the CIJ, which begins on Monday in the Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima submitted against Santiago.
"We will comply and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are leading to this international court today," Humala said alongside his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a hands-press alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Bogota Covenant for which he had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on sea limits with Nicaragua that he considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inassistences of Brazilian presidents, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the destitution of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midday in Lima.
The president read the final document reporting that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, UNASUR countries will “lead important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding residence agreements.”
He reported that actions are driven to improve "cooperation in fighting citizen insecurity and international organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-price internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and sight a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas...by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it gave no further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relationships between neighbors, was another issue underlined by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia’s President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional appointment he expected to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully treat maritime dispute after a ICJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not excluding, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday where they plan to attend the command of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Furthermore, as part of the summit, the bloc’s Defence Ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-tempore presidency of the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “Sura America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to Peruvian state TV that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but they are now virtually a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the draft establishing South American citizenship to encourage the UNASUR member countries.
“We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers from any South American country, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he said.
The Ecuadorian President also showed himself in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give teacher never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," Ecuador said in a statement on political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not regretful of that decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his “deep democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at his time, he had founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected.
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that it be subjected to interrogation in his territory for a suspected sexual offence when "Swedish legislation allows it to be performed by video conference, which could be done from the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa claimed that there is the risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deterioration.
“I haven’t talked to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” Ecuador said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by granting a salvaconduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the lockdown of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is making a number of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
He said, “If Britain gives tomorrow the safeconduct this is over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took advantage of himself to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of press and matched that what he doesn’t tolerate is “mediacity, evil faith and lie, which diverge freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists based on profit, chantage and extortion,” he said.
In that respect, it was congratulated that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it was advanced that being re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and golpism covered with legality" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the Hague International Court of Justice, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the moment that failure is not committed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be broadly processed to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted a good conclusion of the litigation for sea limits held in the same Court of Peru and Chile and said that "it's right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries are committed to accepting a hard ruling whatever it is."
In reference to the eventuality that is presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite tough."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in as unjust situations as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and therefore we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and tells me he travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a return to President Chávez's health status," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for further regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I fell a bomb," he refers to remembering the time of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her sickness alone and began to report on her; with such an effort that she already celebrated her 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided goodbye from him "bearing a cut."
Then having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of its disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" its immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, “the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins timely treatment and the survival of the overall population is exactly the same,” said HCG HIV Unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affection to the immune system that patients have when starting the diagnosis, with best expectations for those who are not drug users: up to a 30-year CD4 with 50 years report.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25 under these terms “as long as they remain in control can live without problems until the age of 75,” the interviewer explained.
To dimension this progress, it is remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, ranging from 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- To me it seems that the problem is not access to treatment.
That’s how I see it, so it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven’t had drug decrease the problem is that patients come very advanced because they don’t know their state of infection, i.e., in late stages of the disease.
"Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection what you have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make earlier diagnosis and therefore massive detection tests to all people who require it."
In their proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in AIDS stage and even suffered a Kaposi's common sarcoma, a cancer.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, I’ll be better go back three times a week,” they say.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I care for me and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who are afraid today, in the framework of World AIDS Day.
Let them do the test, if they were at risk, know more soon if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
This, his message, summarizes the AIDS battle motto in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between the health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause about HIV.
The biggest is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "effectively has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages from one hundred, and that's really fine, but it turns out that there are those who still have no access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them?" is common question, with social workers' dream and value judgments, school guides, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents don't want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the showers and that one hundred are in public bathroom distributors of the sites that frequent young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Neither is it about paying chelas and the motel to them, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if he would have given condoms to his Administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the blood pathway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who don’t know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeal court a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a harmful precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of signatures allowing Mexican laws are invalid in the country of bars and stars, at the contravention of international conventions.
On the practical field, the back to the judgment issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankrott Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
As the judge points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Cruise Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure is the trade competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve unknown international process cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational-profile companies.
Indeed, to this end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Merchant Law was established, and the American Law Institute was arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the merchant competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their matrix, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility recognizes the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Contests.
The right thing is, moreover, that remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the "buy" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will have not achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this blameed Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 to slash the serious economic crisis he faced the United States, taking the collections to the country.
The signing of the González Sada family will soon file a reexamination appeal to the court of appeals itself for the vote to reach the full of the court, i.e. the five judges, given that only three voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States will not prosper the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a superior instance.
The serious thing in the case is that the court dismissed a document submitted by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro is detailed under the Mercantile Contest Act, noting that it dismissed with attachment to the United States agreements signed by both countries to empatter this with Chap 15 of the Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country was fulfilled to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed at the table by the Mexican Aviation unions against the company’s ex-due Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union of Aviation Pilots Association already found the bottleneck.
The instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Values Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract the trust F/589 of the Bank IXE, on behalf of the Mexican of Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the leading shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Meeting the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general civil society members approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Mart Dragon in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products country, with a footwear housing area for employees of 150 companies.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the boardboard and, thanks to him, he travelled the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as it has Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sport for more than 60 years, was a minor category player, National Superior Basketball player, overtaken and leader at the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put many hats on my basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, General Manager of the National Team and Federative President during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to her home in Bayamón, where she resides with her faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes doesn’t exaggerate when making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that denote his wide path, so testify.
Bajamon in the heart
Of all, the most excited ones are the ones that remember his passage through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old acting as a co-powered or franchise-container.
“This was my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, already as a co-powered, co-powered, or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I left one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took office "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have you a strong, 6"7" stature player.
"Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best snipers.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Cowboy Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already away, as it was already a federative mandate for 1988.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his executives and Mincy’s executives at the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the Preolympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990s World Cup, where we arrived in fourth place and it should have been bronze not by that Canadian arbiter who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and gave a blade to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one who won the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) Toñito and young James Carter, the Lion brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been in the 90s due to a knee.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the Pan-American disorder of Mar del Plata, we win gold against all forecasts.
Which has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that's Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his path in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricula leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Among young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your biggest achievement in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious age of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What'd you left to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce’s boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island at national playoffs.
Now the children travel and play too unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers and arbitrators.
I'm pleased.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listening to music, watching videos of my time music on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to basketball games.
And of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a non-scrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new "Dallas" season, died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown in Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving Day holidays.
Linda Gray, who played her wife’s role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a hospital in Dallas, she advertiser Jeffrey Lane said.
I brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss it a lot.
"He was an original person and lived life to the maximum," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in his liver and undergoed a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, performed by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him home.
He was also a protagonist of two comedies that had been short of time on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received papers by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his magistral interpretation of the charmingly hateful J.R. which led Hagman to his ultimate star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectations around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risky in gambling houses.
He also helped give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned it to "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was the daughter of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot her.
J.R. embarrassed her and then threatened to hit her as a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a trampling entrepreneur and an infidel husband who tried his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be internated.
"I know what I want on J.R's stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiated he lost.
Victoria Main, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone “enormous, inside and out of the screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, who had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was immediately no Warner or TNT pronunciation on how the series will manage the loss of Hagman.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried luck at the New York theatre scenarios in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
As he was there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I believed would hurt someone or affect them somehow,” he told Associated Press at that time.
After liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them value, I meet with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like “do not fear, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start course exploring the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when teacher in religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible ankle: The end of the "long regressive account" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have been clamped as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what he expected in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a tax precipitation that some have called "deduarmageddon" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that the Revelation will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
In Temple, deputy teacher Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetic scenarios that guide some human behavior.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could burst.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they were compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and her colleague Amara Solari, an appointed Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made teams to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to take the course once again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Revelation, which doesn’t leave students another option but working “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, on their own, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I’m fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Haddonfield sociology career student in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old Psychology and Nursing career student, said he has watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard about a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed - and much less one teacher - said to believe on the expiry date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and in a certain way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, when people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculation.
“Other sides people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, indicating an exception from a higher authority.
We have an indulgence of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years it has been talked about many days of the final trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Some said they think they are going to "the end of the world" party.
“Perhaps call some friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
