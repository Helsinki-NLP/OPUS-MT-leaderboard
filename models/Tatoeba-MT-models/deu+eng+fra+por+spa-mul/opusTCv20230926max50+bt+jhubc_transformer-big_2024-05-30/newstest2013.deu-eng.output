A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Reelection
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter for a myth, reaffirming that the election fraud in the US is less rare than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have since 2009 announced new laws that make the procedure for registration or urnment difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives were recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced alone in 2011, which restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require the voters to submit a picture card and a proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also shorten the periods for premature voting, declaring the right to register as voters on the election day, and declaring the right to vote to citizens for whom a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has requested the voters to present a picture card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities urged to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the past two years, they promoted legislative drafts in 34 states, with which the voters are forced to present a lighting card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the U.S. citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million voted persons, do not have a picture card issued by a government authority of their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required screening card.
This is enough further.
Students who are considered voters who increase their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their image ID issued by their establishment.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators have promoted laws in eight states that cancel the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general elections have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of the registration of new electors in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aiming to shorten the period for premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who have elected in advance.
On the contrary, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, were only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the display of a picture card.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting rights difficult.
Democratic critics defend the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral bodies to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation in the election system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermined by the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: Should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes makes sense of defective results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We picked up the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early recognition was performed.
That’s why I recommend the test from a age of 50 or 40, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
In men of African-American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be really understood the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he decides more actively to monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment in many men where you have detected cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested for active monitoring and offer treatment when the disease is progressing.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria are determined for a decision who should be treated and who should not be treated.
That is why I still recommend performing the test.
Most importantly, however, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows us to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of being sick on it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats good and move adequately.
“If there were no smokers anymore, this value would rise to at least 50%,” says André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer is caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer types.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, the risk of cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grimm intestinal, mast intestinal, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against grimm intestinal cancer throughout the lifetime," he added.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amount, it increases the risk of cancer from grimm or mast cancer.
Whirlpools should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat through smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the connection between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian cancer society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another rather showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preloading.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzed the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has excited some insight last summer, and this is for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has been predicted, but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists it is not completely sure that it really is Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely secure about it.
Let’s still assume that it’s actually Higgs, because it seems that there’s only a small risk of deceit, and let’s look at what it’s going on.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects to not be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong as you will hurt yourself.
For even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", with this "state" consisting generally of some of their properties.
From this, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing): the mesons we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic power.
Indeed, if a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" precisely in this place, about like a rod that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "bearers of force".
Stabler field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order to show that boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be scattered by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others don’t - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep on the refrigerator itself.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not possess a mass.
What can all these research be "good" for now, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine all differences between observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope most likely that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great defects, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of these researches on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell laboratories did not suspect their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the laser in 1962 himself developed the first permanent string laser (the first were pulsed) - already told us that the laser was considered in the beginning rather than a "lab playing".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it wasn’t the original purpose, this sensor today serves as “eye” to all digital cameras worldwide and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its committee on "Death in Dignity" Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of life end.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that eaten him had left him a two-year period.
“They gave me five years to live, I’ve managed seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil where he had arrived on the day before.
“It’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does her work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he agrees to resign to help with dinner.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medications to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest desire is to heal my diarrhea because this is humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this evil.
“In the course of our life we learn that a man standing is pinching,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the ability of the person" to take a step back, he notes.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, great events take place in the middle of these backstages.
Patients entered into the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer accumulated by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really met my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says before she accepts to put her on a mask that helps her breathing.
In the next few days, she still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy.
At home Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers offers personal care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants come a bed for palliative care.
This is very little when you take into account that one day we will all die.
Life is continued here under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Mouth care is given to the dying person with Brandy or Pepsi, depending on the desire.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died throughout the night.
This morning his son will drunk the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help families and patients equally," reports the nursing director Nathalie Savard.
At home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his head pillows while attacking to his honor, a 36-year-old young man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies in a tragic way after he tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are always involved with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Christiane Martel.
53% of Victor-Gadbois’ home-inserted patients come from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that is intended to alleviate patients’ suffering when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or in a nursing house.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the largest Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great insufficiency in Quebec’s health care ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care are confronting the adoption of a death aid and assisted suicide law with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to move to the death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency hospital without taking measures to relief her.
I’m afraid that patients want to die only because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst predictions to the last day.
Hélène Richard’s survival chances were already minimal when she discontinued complicating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to discontinue treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I was up for the fight, she told.
But she told me that I'm at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for failing to accept this desire after their pain has been allevied by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly said that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Montreal Household Palliative Care Society, 8% of the patients do not address pain treatment.
At the end of life, physicians are therefore often resorting to the terminal sedation, which is based on either sporadic or permanent blowing the patient until the time of his death.
We cannot do any longer as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to use this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to inject me,” but “I want my pain to be alleviated.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandal large dimensions in Quebec
Road build officers, build-master companies, political parties’ money creators and Italian mafia specialists tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafiaists are enclosed.
A "industrie" which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system breaks down since drastic measures have been taken,” says Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the disruptions in connection with the treaties on road construction work in Quebec, which then Prime Minister had only agreed in contradiction.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and abduction of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasizes, "that alone the Ministry of Transport had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them restrained their instinct to gain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to fall," he adds, in hope that it will be able to "show the tactics behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Launched in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit also undertakes great efforts with its troops from auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau" team, which has since 2009 caused Montreal's "Channelization Kartell" to be more retained in the artificial blowdown of the treaties.
In the past few weeks, she has carried out a number of house searches and accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricating money in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal Road Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurore and Lino Zambito, were accused.
The latter has excited by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for receiving public contracts.
He himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for several years to an intermediary associated with the mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in the power.
He also managed to have organized an illegal funding for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Channel agreements whose costs were artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprise described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as $736,000 cash in exchange for channel agreements, whose cost he artificially supplied.
Other road officers admitted that they were allowed to lubricate by artificially blowing the invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay, accused he intentionally overlooked a shadow budget filling his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, which fell into a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first members who hit alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal ground that was purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately conducted, she says that she draws "to a thread that allows you to understand how the system is invaded by ants to stop the evil and to blame the culpable."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in cleansing the wound, however, needed a single investigation unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau points out that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but especially worrys about the role of “command carriers that are in the picture of tactics” if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was said that this is only a weak denial of reality."
The Quebec government suggests limiting donations to parties to $100, which he says wouldn’t change the situation: “As long as electoral campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the procurement of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to take a look at their own rear courtyard...
“PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
This season, you have taken a new degree with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my game level.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes quickly.
But I don't break into enthusiasm.
From my beginning at the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to playing games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the forehead and wants to do his best.
Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I just recovered from a series of injuries at the time.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us the place of the top rider.
But we're launching in background.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to reach as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to talk to our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can play the back of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the funds to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as this was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to reject this title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though major teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the thing to win it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected from us.
We accept this perfectly.
However, when we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, this is certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what people expect.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game concept.
A team grows up with time.
In the Champions League we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and who has also made huge spending!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to have a pause with 15 points!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would not be aware.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, have been "boosted by this new PSG."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winners in May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the benefits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better to talk about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That’s why he came and proves that he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has shown himself that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people surrounding him.
What he has done is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very pleased to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from putting out some game time.
I have seen things from which I came strong.
Today I’m able to make good games in the national team.
This was my hope since I baptized with the "Blue".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to take on a good behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and encourages the victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does this constitute an initial game forcible in Spain on October 16th (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling is possible without bank
The opposite of current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is captivable: the conviction that the current monetary system designed by bank monopoles leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent that allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a payment means.
After the Bitcoin rate reached a maximum of $30 in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering today to about $10 (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing especially impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy by gambling (and sometimes re-exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are available throughout the public account account book spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, possessing the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a partition of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole "hacks".
The aim is to find the number that results in a special fingerprint (many zero at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without linking, as both of them have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task will receive 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent an inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth, leaving a certain space.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide bitcoin services have been attacked and theft bitcoin deposits.
“The weakness used does not affect the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company to pay for real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this defect.
Important actors such as Wikipedia decline donations of this kind.
Others like the blog platform WordPress are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega closure sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for bitcoin to end up, but 2013 could be a turning point," he forecast.
In its report, by the way, the ECB provides for the re-assessment of the various risks today highly regarded in the event of a success of this currency.
We have departed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It’s time for the Afghan army to retain the possession of their territory and for the Afghan population to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan peasants by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and contemplated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse armed foreign presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekians and Tajikians have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, was properly done.
The helicopter’s overflighted trucks and tank convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer have flows in Kabul.
Since its irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country was covered by war due to the struggles of the various opposing groups.
Their overtake of power was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mudshaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by seized government plots to sell them as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus draw advantage from the massive American sub-contracting.
They caught themselves, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people wish a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to make the American benefits useful: capital escape is significant.
Young people have tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world, and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to provide jobs.
All, even the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, representing a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now present.
Are the authorities under whose command they are considered to be legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already endeavour to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolition of the Prime Minister’s office since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidency.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industry has not been rebuilt, operational storage systems are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced apart from fruits and vegetables.
The private initiative is left priority.
In a country that was underpinned by 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor was widespread that Afghanistan has immense soil values.
This further enhances the impression that the Western countries were only on site to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper grass on site, or without transportation means for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site, and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relationships.
The withdrawal of the French fighter troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girl and young gymnasies, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural field, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Department of Defense (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to attempt to gain the "hes and ghosts" and task task.
These works, which were required for numerous local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural useful areas.
What souvenirs will we leave after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very tough in these valleys at a height of more than 2,000 meters.
In the embassy, dozens of written requests of small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa have received.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their desire according to their own statements, the continuation would be less, more well-controlled and they would be required for direct civilian assistance in their favour.
A Constitution with the Breakthrough in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him unlimited authority, he decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been based on a preliminary, multi-changed text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for a stronger splitting of the country.
For his opponents, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "break his word" and "the right goes with feet."
On the side of his supporters, it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to renounce their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to recover his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is tough throughout the country.
According to an interview with the American week screen Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, the Egyptian people with this recurrence to a quick vote will be put an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
Mostly 85 Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe they were unable to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making ability, 11 persons, deputy members, have been added yesterday morning in all haste.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It’s not surprising that the articles were generally unanimously adopted.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only difference of the day was expressed... at the time of prayer, since some members of the board believed that the clock of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which has been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which draws all attention, remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible for more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals who view this only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Articles 220, which acknowledge the University of Al-Azhar to be advisory, in particular in regards to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “the people who are asked to make a comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no concrete religious commitment to recognize.
This constitution remains within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that there may be multiplicity with respect to Article 220, since the terms used have been denied the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, no.
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civilian judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized because of the widespread powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's desire, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to the National Defence Council.
Likewise, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have called for to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider as a threatening to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will be marching on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the world’s needle and a sole sea
The Promised Land combines in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that everyone who baths in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus made his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding party, the walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the seasurm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most holy places are found in Jerusalem.
The believers are here on the path of suffering or cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins from the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the tomb church on the mountain Golgotha, where the place of crucifixion, the ointment stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the world’s navel, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the Cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the wall of law, the remnants of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there letters with desires that then come to fulfill.
Make a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 BC.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins by their own power.
Everyone else brings an air track to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it draws countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are nearly 300 museums.
Only one trip cannot all of them be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among these is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or rolls of the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Jewish Desert, and approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibitions.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which accommodates several halls of old Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the visitors and bathingmen.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures from Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most prestigious department is the monument for children built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died were apparent.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recovery areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinaries and oceans.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea is also baded during the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air is heated up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimming easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is undescribedly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing mushroom, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and for calming strappated nerves.
Touch the secrets of ancients
These secrets include the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway passed, which linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets named after starmarks.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all holds that touch the walls in the street with its star sign.
In Jaffa, you can find new-married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can clip through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and residence of the Roman governor, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
List for tourists
When traveling to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred to take not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be switched to shekel (current exchange rate: $1 to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you usually go ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the country’s only underground line with six stations that connect the underground to the upper town.
It is a underground stand train.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is reached by incl. switching for a drive of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is committed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
On Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only cosher food is served, which excludes pork, sea products, fish without sparks and foods that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hamme and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of spiced beans and grass (falable) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no striking dogs.
For this, there are many well-eaten cats that are cozy and unfealed through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
Cats like animated seats and say no to liking.
A car rental costs from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world have visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, which corresponded to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa obligation was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While deputies and citizen lawmakers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals already act with counterfeit certificates
Annually, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every worker migrant must deploy a test certified the knowledge of the Russian language.
This regulation so far applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests over time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are expected to become a duty for all host workers.
It is not only necessary to put language tests, but also to put tests into Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and renewal of the labour permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is official language.
Also, persons who received their certificates and diplomas prior to the decay of the USSR in 1991 are exempt from this Act.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
The entirety of examinations will be under the egide of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can test in all towns; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, citizens of laws have repeatedly asked before the entry into force of the law in the press: What does it do?
What changes are the requirement to have language skills for both the Russians and the hosts?
Especially, spokespersons of the Migration Authority respond, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
“Many now talk about the protection of the rights of migrants,” says the head of the representative of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Your rights must, however, be protected from your departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants encounter problems without vocation, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will necessarily encounter people with evil intentions who put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will sustain with dozens of his similar months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In home you will be promised one, and upon arrival you will be deceived, getting their passports declined and not getting the promised wage,” confirms the head of the Tajikistan Migration Authority’s Labour Migration Administration, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't go, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn money in Russia acknowledge not only that they can not dominate the language of the target country, but also hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekians and Tajikians can afford a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, not to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humble and low-quality."
Citizens of law emphasize the following important aspects.
Only migrants with legal status have to deploy the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of hosts continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Heart welcome" or "forbidden access to unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and of course the linguistic difficulties.
Furthermore, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
Employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly counterfeited and we are not registered, and this results in cases of depression.
“They want one or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea,” Tadjike Umed Huschkadamow said to journalists.
"No costs for wrong papers fear"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be fake.
Some fake certificates that certifie the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be purchased easily, both officials and citizens are agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a basic language course.
Furthermore, new arrivals with no language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Ministry of Interior ignores illegal weapons market
Share of legal weapons in extremely low offences
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans to exacerbate the arms law for private weapons owners.
The authorities react to the recent events: injured in shootings on weddings and seven deaths in the running of Moscow’s lawyer Dmitri Winogradw.
The police want to ban the use of non-deadly weapons in public and increase the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law will be submitted soon to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various weapons associations - demand from the authorities to take away from "senseless exacerbations".
The percentage of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said criminal lawmakers, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian BBC service.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons over six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168,000 crimes were recorded for the same period.
The writers of the open letter are convinced that an exhaustion of the private weapons owner law will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
According to the authors, you can now find any possible weapons in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons go through several channels to the black market.
There are five such major channels, tells a former counter Viktor Baranez, who worked ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both police weapon chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some cases were fire-foundation to bear the lack of weapons," the former military member said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
“Nowadays there are countless private arms factories that do not resist international competition and therefore wear the weapons under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert said.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military member explains.
Where are the weapons from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels of the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature and publicly accessible data on weapons portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons comes to investigators, according to the army and law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the "debt of responsible persons who have reached in their work with weapons," the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% return to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser to a weapon shop that does not want to be named names, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long no longer been buying as they are old.
According to him, it is more common that dealers get their resumption in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a pistol of type TT, is purchased via a countertop.
The gun is issued and passed through the wall.
“The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
“The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to discover crimes, they will periodically conduct control purchases from traders offering illegal weapons,” the sales adviser adds.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find most often about known one another.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone was aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me that would bring me to somewhere where we could then negotiate the price.
The prize for the weapon I only learned there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales counselor. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and agree with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich who lets the daughter lose a tooth."
I’m even currently going to a few rings over a acquaintance whom I trust.
He also gives me the bead rings only because he knows I don't spice him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez attempted himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schemes did not change.
He received a photo album in which “all possible” was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer I not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
“Then I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we’re negotiating with each other,” the expert describes the process.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for papers or personal meetings.
“You only need the appropriate sum of money,” says the advertisement on the website “Buy fighter gun or gun.”
There users place your orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," users asked "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched into countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and may swell coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank automate.
“As answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon,” reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization “Pravo na oryzhie” Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and come behind grids when you place an enquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched into countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service.
"People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land into the Siberian working camp and may be shot coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, buying illegal guns, prices of $100 to $900 are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarow type gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arms warehouses by supervisors of middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons across Russia declined by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of discovered cases of theft and depression related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices declined by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket employees are striking
Each fourth U.S. teenager sits at some point behind Mc Donald’s cash.
In the past few days, massive protests came across the United States against low wages in Walmart’s stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will swell further or whether the air will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-oriented non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
To date, this industry of the economy has hardly been trade unionally organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, so-called Black Friday, when sales took place in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, launched their work and strike together with trade unions and left activists in the chain, whose target group are people with low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windows to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart commercials are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only buy on their own workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply because employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complains about heavy working conditions, such as fork truck or handscanner.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed their trouble that the contribution to the health insurance of their own had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley have shown that if the company increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
These are about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart completely removed the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost it only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be only $12.39 a year for them compared to today.
Advocates of Walmart are satisfied that protests have occurred in only nine states and that they did not lead to any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its shop from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart boxes carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the left-oriented Huffington Post website, said that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees set up the work and the protest action was merely “another PR trick” of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart (which is not desired in this advanced city and therefore not existing so far) but were McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don’t give you sick days, and you won’t be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
Less than she deserves anyone in this expensive city.
As it is possible to spend so little money in New York, I’m incomprehensible.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers standed behind McDonald's after school, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s staff, I’m constantly meeting people who complain that they’re going out with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is unresponsible to get children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, who began Thursday at 6.30 in the morning before McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue, called for the cassiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants to receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate management to stand in the path of this goal and reject or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, business management doesn’t make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personal flow.
Unsatisfied
Loud protests also took place on that day before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was an assembly in the midnight before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including town board member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet they don't grant you sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should jointly support fast-food employees so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on-site, of whom far aren’t all occupied in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands are working in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the lightning of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
“The brain can only be moderately overlisted.”
The popular topic of expanded reality among modern technologies is recently usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google presented a functioning model in the summer at its annual conference, then in November it was known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
However, in talking with the head of the Microsoft interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Shahram Izadi laboratory, it is clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a passage station.
It enthusiasts the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with naked hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe shortly what research your group does.
- We deal with the interaction of humans and machines, however, we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained mostly stuck in the phase where pixels are worked on flat screens, sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are a progress, and today, no Xbox is sold without Kinect as all of them are interested in movement control.
What else is waiting for us in the future?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it fassable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
First of all, we should get rid of these deceitful virtual reality helicopters!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform all the recurrents about their actions and intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their specific niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short, instead of loading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and language.
- How about it?
- Would we ask you, for example, to give you this spray box?
They say it and indicate it at the same time.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what doesn't?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will need to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that enable people to react more accurately.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It has to be taken into account not only along the X and Y resolution, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and openly, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a regulable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human and machine interaction.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared station and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a common RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem because more calculations would be needed.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in tridimensional determining a position.
- If I remember right, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the road, but I think the following: the greatest variant would be an "changing" advanced reality in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an advanced reality with glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
Let’s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortal.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: There is no feelable reaction!
The hands don’t feel anything at all.
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often speak that advanced reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between humans and machines.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
It sees pressure greatly!
However, there are also technologies that are actually focused on giving the "pictures in the air" something strong, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling which is still so weak as someone pushed over the balls.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerve ends in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlist your brain?
Do you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight for a long time: to believe a person who is physically located in a closed room, he is instead in an open, practically infinite room; here we work on concepts with running tapes (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlisted, and there are many years in front of us.
Just that makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene already landed, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearings, which you meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings, or at failure.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s pictures are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and enchanted by his presence on the street a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and ensures good mood with them.
Recently, he captured a rotational orgel and became a Petersburg rotational orgel player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist being, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society, everything that differs from grey standards, aggressions, and bad behavior.
But I want to talk with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you need to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I have to go that way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I fell friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it emerged "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only finished.
It moves me to theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
And all that was combined in your art clinic... it was important for me to be at the center of Petersburg's culture where the best creating artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artist club for the Bohemians, the house of Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovation works.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Line and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing narrow suits and belonging to them also today’s famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his big career, but he learned the foundations from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the newspaper involving the award "personality of our city".
I won in the category "Arts of the Year", and thus I was at the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
Many of my images are real pearls and clearly express the currentity and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I was previously social, but now it pains and makes it afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all of this is washing and losing his tragic.
I love the Grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribed that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone takes attention to the clothes and orients themselves on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But perhaps you shouldn’t give a man your hand, but you should snug in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's rotary player, a cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful too?
Today, commercial art must be cautious, respectful and flavouring.
We see the breakdown of cultures.
Before, people formed large groups: Bohemia loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now every cult star has approximately 100 trailers.
- But to the performances of Stas Michailow, there are several thousands!
- Left women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore, less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the achieved.
In my youth I painted pictures that were even attached to a collector in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come until the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings today.
It is said: spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of Culture.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
In the real cars it was different, because the cars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that might be experts, but the path will be locked down, as it requires higher-level experts who correctly evaluate the first ones and free them the path.
Now only counts your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don’t have to accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutritional ground.
Art can grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural nutritional floor, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe visiting exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded from grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer steroid.
Caravans of spaceships with land inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we can grow in gravity or on the replacement planet?
There are many choices in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says the scientist employee of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees remains on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible at great height or in the orbit of the Venus, that is, in all.
The question of reproduction in all dealt with the researchers first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of herbs grown in orbit did not differ at least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely from tiny fruit flights (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guardians were sent to the space to explore how severity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a quite normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chicken has to find a stop; it has to stand on his legs and start moving,” explains the laboratory manager of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid underground, the chickens surrounded themselves wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely declined.
The chickens did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
“Two times we let chickens pluck and then set up the whole because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychew at the failed experiment with the chickens in the whole.
The last brut cage with animals fled into the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be located on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that have already been sent to all.
Nothing was found in principle.
“This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued,” said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils were given childhood.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped out of their natural habitat cannot simply follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, humans might be able to do this in principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
Women have flyed to the whole for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkowa.
The most valuable thing that mankind owns is the female organism.
Our mowe flew from it, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: Does it overcome the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“No one answered this question,” says Space Veteran Watchtang Watchnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, she born the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkowa, a daughter.
The child’s father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Swetlana Sawizkaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, born a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy childhood.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights to the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the Soviet Union's hero and the Russian Federation's hero.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolaboratory at the preparatory center of cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a sweat state, the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water represents severity.
Although adults feel water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander witnessed that life on the land escaped from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother’s belly in the fruit water, and that it can then be easier used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming only passes 2 weeks.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While severity is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not expire without gravity.
In the state of severity, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decreases enormously rapidly and thus decreases the ability to press the child out.
Well, let’s handle this through birth initial tools.
For example, birth may also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?", is Waleri Poljakov's unimportant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling Earth drawing, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in a load suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance for his life.
“This experiment we conduct together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled, a completely untailored person,” says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Issues.
To date, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
But at some point it becomes reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will become the home for their descendants born in all.
NKU-Head: Control of Black System fails due to political debt
Czech Republic has good control instances and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, however, it declines in their application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NK<0xC4><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly – and this is not the case with us,” Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar outcome appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harass businesses with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot come simply to the President of the Government, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, impedes in its activities,” Kala says.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, they talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What did it happen to concretely?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simply stated, it is about the European legislative establishment of how public contracts are to be handled, which builds up national legislations, and finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we could find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws with us may be even somewhat "thanks and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more accurate rules again and you have to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project for you?
Just such a joint control could help to stop ourselves constantly striving for the perfection of laws and the reduction and austerity of thresholds if this apparently does not have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it’s even so that we only burden the system in this way with excessive “paper” and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than when the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As for the authorities, the German Pendant to the NKÚ of the Bundesrechnungshof, which is constructed similarly to us and also has a college that is only a little differently formed, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competencies are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these accounting centres are also available in the individual states - in that the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal means, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the National Accounting Offices.
As for German legislation, is it easier than ours?
Generally, I would not like to compare this without specific information, but Germany is often referred to as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that because the auditors are better?
I do not, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
To this end, it is important to note that even those countries that are an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing about working with our authority, right?
As for Czech legislation, what was the importance of the news of the bidding law for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
Bearing in mind that this novel is only in force for a short period of time, it does not have any effect on our tests yet.
Since our controls take place afterwards, you have to expect some delay here.
So far, if we feel the effects of future controls - we introduced the new control instrument "Detection of Risks of Ineconomics" and reviewed and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - the changes will, of course, be affected here as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with another bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem can occur that the rules become "strenger" and cannot be complied with anymore.
Already under the previous rules, persons subjected to an examination against the institution (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) are responsible for any non-compliance with the procurement law to be equal to a breach of the budgetary discipline.
Is it useful to make the law even stricter?
I don't think in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, rather than those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let’s say what path is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not agree with the businesses with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the Chairman of the Government, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, impedes in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing was.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also proper for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly – and that is what I think is missing in us.
On the roads there are ice glaciers, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice glacier.
Most of the roads are well-travelable, however, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the Karlsbad district, the streets were well conductable this morning, in a single way there were snow and ice glacier.
Temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it is expected to become a little warmer during the day.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the deepest altitudes remains only a thin snow cover.
However, on the cames of the Arz mountains are about 30 cm snow.
According to the district road awakening, there was limited views due to fog.
The highway R6 and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully driveable.
However, attention is provided, for example, on bridges on which the roads are sometimes eastern and smooth.
Similarly, all the traffic routes of the second and third road class, including the mountain roads, are available.
However, the snow remains on these roads in a sectional manner.
Increased attention is therefore provided, in particular, in the higher layers.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets in Eastern Bohemia there is danger because of ice glacier, in higher layers and in the mountains lies on the streets sometimes a snow layer, the road and motorway direction informs on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers from ice glaze, which can occur in particular in higher areas in the district of Pardubice.
It can be used in particular on traffic routes of the second and third road class in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
In particular, snow lies on the roads in the giant mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An exhausted snow layer is located in heights on the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or heavy today, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well-travelable today, but there is increased attention to the local, and the driving way is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the frozen point.
Because it snowed before and the temperatures then dropped, it can occur on the streets to ice cream.
It is also expected to have mist, but the view will be improved throughout the day.
These information comes from the District Road Championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully driveable, however, high attention recommends street masters between the 80th and the 131th kilometres.
The highways of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, however, it can sectionally come to ice glacier.
The paths of the second and third road class are wet, and therefore also applies to the indication of possible railway sections.
Drivers should be particularly cautious mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohmerwald area.
Olomouc district
Today, snowmatch must be expected to drivers traveling towards the heights in the Olomouc district.
After the use of spread vehicles, snowmatch remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drive forced the street championships to be used, in the district of Šumperk dropped about 3 cm of snow, according to the road administration.
In the remaining areas of the district, the roads are usually unlimited.
"In the circle of Šumperk, snow remains in the heights.
At the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers towards Jeseník have to expect snowmatch,” an employee of the road administration Šumperk today told ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district had to go out at night, according to their reports, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are fully driveable, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still moist here.
District Ústí nad Labem, Liberec District
In Northern Bohemia, the street championships report several poorly conducible road sections.
In addition to several locations with snow or ice glaze, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the district of Ústí n.K., according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in lower locations below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the roads. From the depths, particularly southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disorders have been reported until now.
Ice glaze is reported in particular from the circle of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - overnight rain and melting snow, overnight cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes and from the street I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported bad traffic conditions.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to shafts pushed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about that will take place in less than a month of the world’s ending?
This is one of those disaster messages we like to jump to people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more fun about it and say that we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers in more detail?
This is a country-wide benefit event that we are planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is forecast for the end of December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time from 21:00 a.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is about the time that the Maya calendar ends in the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone for 12 hours in front of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally, we probably then designed the idea together with our graphics player Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the decline of the world, but also, together with the public, to think about the condition in which we once pass this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and keychains against the end of the world, with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other interpreters, has also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "World Falls Out".
Already today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and finally, provided that everything is going on and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is intended to be singed by all interpreters at the same time on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a direct circuit of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the videoclip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to collaboration with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which relates to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to intensively engage these people in our projects.
It has been shown that most of us are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the earnings of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education center Studeo, on which we are working six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly assisted by readers to help them in different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lessons, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will create a building in which we will then engage with this project.
Several groups and interpreters occur at each concert.
Which criteria did you choose?
We wanted to compile a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn more about the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” planned for the future too?
For the first time in May we arrive at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to attend the Czech House in New York next year, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to connect this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group consisting of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs need to be transported in the luggage room, and of course we need to drag many instrument bags and other luggage with them...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I sometimes have sometimes been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your abroad trips you have a comparison of how it looks like in each country with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabled, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that everything in the east is still in its beginnings.
In front of Prague, Moscow is absolutely not right for disabled persons, where it is still unusual when someone is on the wheelchair alone in the city center.
It’s not even obvious that you’re leaving a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to recover from the more developed countries?
There are still many things we hang in behind...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common that people with severe disability can move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilet, etc.
But it is not just common that there is a larger group of people with disabilities actively involved in the social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only if important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really begin to change.
To date, these are only individual cases of particularly willing personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go a few years back, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At the time I began as a caregiver at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with somewhat intensely.
And since I am a musician and also a saxophone playing, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, this is something out of control, as our moderator, Láđa Angelovič, used to say.
But the band became known only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we also started actively advertising for ourselves.
We have become aware that when you do something and not see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality equipment and otherwise.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
In show business today, one of us often copies one another.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and is accepted only after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I wage to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed somewhat, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success to be a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise in many things and you need to require a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have a sample twice a week, have to complete preparation phases, and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm will quickly end in many.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band that works seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láđa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome to us.
Instead of the day before the forecast worldwide fall, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
Event locations are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and more musicians
All three events are finally connected with each other by live switching and it appears to be a joint interpretation of the hymn "World Fall falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional handicapped education center to create under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age for free, cards are available in pre-selling at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Organization (ESA) at the Council of Ministers at a meeting of the European Space Organization (ESA) membership, which is the second membership of the former Eastern Bloc (Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s way into space began a lot earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts dealt with spacecraft, not always encountering understanding.
I remember here, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to the Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), however, left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch created by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "entry into cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important defender of astronomy and spacecraft.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books about these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of spacecraft was deserved, among other things, by naming one of the craters on the face of the Moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway drive was built in Poland, for which a missile drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to launch or brake the draisin.
The information about this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-operated shoots.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents presented, it is clear that the research was introduced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the entry of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press of Ing. Rohziński's design of a photoelectric hunting rocket appeared, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects on military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Preliminary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasovy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on spacecraft appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of spacecraft are dedicated.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space society.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was not expected that space exploration would have the future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA endeavored to join the International Federation for Spacecraft, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became an ordinary member already in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been largely involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was approximately 80 cm long and did not weigh entirely 5 kg.
Later, an enhanced version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, the Błędow Desert began flight tests with the RM-2 two-stage missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring height winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was stopped.
Followers of the first RM-type missiles were the Meteor-1 missile developed in 1962 to 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed by this missile, which differ from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 liters of capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height of all three types was 37 km.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which two years later followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision prompted a vibrant discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem once from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is the cause of the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with stubborn financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
Under this term, a state in which the manufacturer attempts to exist in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "supporting" the competition in order to break a larger market share on its own and increase its profit.
In large scale, this means for most companies to move their manufacturing abroad or purchase there, or to give up their business, which is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital is not responsible for the unemployment caused by it, state expenditures are necessarily rising.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so specific statistics are overflowable at this point.
The respectless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without regard to the social consequences to private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, by economic force for long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by circumcision of employee rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poverty and rich.
In Germany, for several years, there are public food tax offices for poverty who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people already goes into the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income until the minimum of their existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly go beyond the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic downturn of their social levels (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage at the edge of society and hope that somewhere private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, naturally, is the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains equal, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, the employees are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim until the overthrow that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital maintains closely in its view that the state is not allowed to interfere directly in the economy.
But then you have to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the unique answer: yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of an almost all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual disposition, a legislation in which practically everything is criminal but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is so that a state department lack of finance is responsible for private legal companies closely connected to the industry to draft legislation.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is then no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are currently quickly going into a situation as Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: “The state has long been in decay, and the offices have been occupied by violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful removal of benefits or with stone and sword.
"People with character didn't hire for offices, so that the state had no consul as a result of this decline for eight months," he said, "but he began to really talk about that the only medicine in this serious situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected on Pompeiian.
As it is shown, today’s society, as well as in the ancients, is based on the unconscious preference of its own advantage without regard to all society interests.
Private capital has not been able to recognize and enforce the advantage of the entire society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not at least strive for deeper reforms.
Therefore, we need to look for the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the unconscious liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s state, the destruction of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already derived.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnesses today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the old and newer history, in perfect ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent solution.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted politically-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
“...nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise,” Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain: “...so that we cannot forget how fragile we are.”
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians as terrorists; others in turn support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the State of Israel as terrorists.
I do not want to write at this point about who in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is victim; ultimately, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
I am concerned with opening a look to readers behind the scenes, the look to whom the 95-year tension (accordingly from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East is especially served.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and outline from my own understanding of who or which group of people influences significantly the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of struggle for power.
In any epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is whether it was really always those personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is focused less on individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power arising from it has not emerged within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particularly distinguished one that could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone is above them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about it.
Understandingly.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to stop their name’s connection with high criminal deeds, in the background of which they always strengthened their power, their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they are conducting wars or equipped with them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the collapse Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia undergoing its central bank.
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began to release his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue its own banknotes and wanted to remove the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the release of the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschild's global power gestures led in the years 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan for the unlocking of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aims to eliminate Europe's great monarchist states, in particular the colonial rule of Britain should be broken through the second war, and the third war aims to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would ultimately take care of their amenities and luxury and would not lead to so many resources) to create an universal religion than the ecus.
The method with which the group of the wealthiest families works at the top with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED so that crises such as the crises they triggered in 1907 are not repeated).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburger throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zarian Empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsarian Empire the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary occurred.
In order to easier deplete World War II, the bankers made a latent conflict situation through politics by demonstrating Germany with gigantic war repairs, creating the prerequisite of five poor masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans with a sufficiently strong colour leader, who had the named guilty and simply solved Tlow;
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as much as possible on the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The previously mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler disappeared from the chain in which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war repairs against Germany the ground for the Second World War, the state of Israel is the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the front line of combat, this time along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (only remember how sharply people divide into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty and who is the sacrifice in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spirale of violence, with at the beginning the individuals and their pursuits for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, place exclusively their own candidates to choose.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism vulnerable, loyally dedicated politician to international bankers who will do everything to destroy a war with Iran, which could proceed over the worldwide because of Iran’s membership in the Shangai Organization of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...)
In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a crisis all around, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn chip is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, except that he has the mark, name of the beast or number of his name.
Here is wisdom, whoever has intelligence, thinks about the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
Movie Argo: If it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they requested the delivery of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the Revolution, who had kept the patronate over his regime over decades.
There was no positive way for the U.S. government from this situation - it couldn't allow themselves to throw the Shah over board, as it would have severely damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution committed to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy strike for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent Fiasko in the violent attempt to remove hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were made by the Algerian government.
The fate of hostages brought out a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran moods at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small part victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA managed in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring refugees from Iran, helping them an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passes as members of a film stack that allegedly visited the country's scenario for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by Tony Mendez, the exfiltration expert, also required Hollywood’s collaboration.
In order to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialized journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the movie - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no great differences in the film recording of the same situations).
On the other hand, the luxurious passages from Hollywood, which come ironic and slightly overwhelming therefore.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in suit at the meeting table, on the office flowers, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic notes.
Argo is his third film after the Crime No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first film that doesn’t play in Boston’s director’s homeland.
The sense for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director were cut off from the Hollywood Standard.
Affleck proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" from Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually occurred - the entry sequence of the storm of the embassy is very impressive in its overallness, nevertheless, conveying the feeling of confusion and unpredictableness that happens when somewhere the story moves.
A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team even in fictional scenes (the wrong film stack on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually doesn’t offer many exciting scenes in the movie sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality somewhat - which does not always look so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned off by a telephone call in America, or even the hunting on the start track, appear somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is conditioned by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have deserved more space, and therefore they are not far alone in the film.
Affleck’s movie loses a lot of traction, which is a movie that can be tracked with a certain interest while going to the design and the retro style that remembers a thriller from the 70s.
Enthusiasm, however, is hard to wake up.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history in a certain way until today, and as a proof of how covered the ideas of the almighty and all-known intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflation of air balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls for a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to organize the competition "Absurd Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
“To this idea, the EU’s recent plan to introduce a women’s rate of 40% in the management of large European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organization of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court on the unifying of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies.
Further incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include the binding combination of bioethanol to fuels that are naturally harmful, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the size of chicken cages that this year has become essential to you.
In the past, criticism also gained the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butterflies" or also the prohibition of sales for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU equipment often decides under the pressure of those lobbys from trade and industry whose claims are generally represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, Czech Republic is currently attempting to enforce the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also to say that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and are not allowed to have "crumping anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonizes the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU’s standards on fruit and vegetables have already been noted against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous guidelines would lead to food loss.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the last year’s EU regulation, which, according to air balloons, must be noted that children under eight years of age cannot inflate the air balloon without an adult’s supervision.
The EU called for an American study that, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of children’s death of cracking.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market roasts.
There are curious incidents at home too.
Relatively absurd is also a directive concerning European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire in addition to the e.g. absurdities, also the EU Regulation on the scope of food stocks in the field of a Member State.
The EU therefore established the maximum volume of food stocks that was allowed to be located in the field of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for fungal conservations, which threatened a high fine for us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for the fact that they don’t have sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for grant funds.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for refund from the EU,” said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state camps were overwhelmed as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission came towards Czech Republic to organize a tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for funding applications offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it should be funding for the composition of funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the member countries are easily the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and therefore also to effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, some experts believe, are more recognised.
These experts believe a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration but which have been forced in the budget negotiations by individual member countries.
Emotions in this country also provokes the fact that Czech Republic must struggle similarly to other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition has come back to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to renamed "Tuzemák".
The Rum name may be used only for products made of sugar pipe distilled, not for products made of sugar pipes.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschink now also dive on the Karlsbader Zwiebeck, the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer Hop.
With a EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebcake or the Hořicer roles can breast up.
"People want me to save the republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how do we come to the idea of candidating for the office of the President?
I am not about being Senator or President.
If everything in our country would work without trouble, I wouldn’t have a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves are running freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don’t like, then I’m trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, independent and partial, I have no other way to influence things but to candidate for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then went on the way to the castle right away.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I have told myself all the time that I will start the struggle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I explained this and said that I will be candidating for the office of the President, provided I am elected to the senator.
But my goal is not the function, but the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but that we are destroying everyone who wants to change something.
This comes with the media who want to steal the honor of one, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed that I would be a journalist or that I was a consultant by Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have taken the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million crowns.
For this, you need to change the laws.
As President, you have no competencies in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used to make the guide remain a free business, and this could be implemented.
The problem is small-spiritual policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population.
As an independent partyless, I have a much greater potential to gain support for all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without thinking of drawers and party dogs from any party.
Do you see yourself in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, people see me rather left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is absolutely unimportant.
It is important for me that we continue.
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always support publicly any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
It’s unlike you if someone calls you popularists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
This can be referred to as populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, only keywords will be left to you.
And so you don’t get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you’ll succeed, for example, to enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to urge the Presidents of Parliament parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then, if appropriate, the respondents should say why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene.
Only once take the direct election of the president, who was a deserve of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I’m trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with politics and tryed to find support for my program for the majority.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not able to achieve anything alone, so I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to candidate for the Senate.
I spoke, for example, with Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overload of work.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed fraud in trading light heating oil.
I started with the prerequisite that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will struggle for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district captains.
Do you think about the establishment of your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
Do you have no money?
You talk about asset statements, how do yours look?
I estimate my private assets to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, a collection of art worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was, by the way, a child’s dream – James Bond always liked as he drived in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fighted evil.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program might not wake too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live alone from the salary of the senator, so I couldn’t finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn’t have anything for it.
So are you still working as an entrepreneur to have your exit?
Didn’t you say you’re going to return these activities?
But this does not relate to the amount of salary.
As I promised, I have returned my activities in part.
For example, my deputy will be the director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live from something too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still the same.
As a president, I would have completely stopped my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Pravo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it's beautiful, the house is already."
But I wonder what we need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily into one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly needed sleep town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general formation and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges shown on the euroschedules as beautifully pinched steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was bordered.
And thus the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become the lord of statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of great barrel diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the thing with usual serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grins on the face.
And while the jury still doubted to look around and sucked with the axles, the fucking Maas stacked to a pyramid and finished his actionistly underpinned speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that is he, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the expensive 30 million euros mountain was sparked.
It is part of a revitalization project including underground garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town retort, which until now had no longer to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind which white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture more rich.
Specifically, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of his existence.
The long path to the book
The first impression: library dorado under cheese cloak.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massive, the true space and reading floors open up at the foot rise of topography.
The entirely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak uncompromisingly the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for Parkbank, Dog and Football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Usually the book shelves stand along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room that is usually uncomfortable and unpersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is skillfully used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technical center.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves that are sometimes wall coating, sometimes barrage, sometimes steaming.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even incarnated architects and construction engineers shake their heads by the unknown construction material.
“We wanted to work here with recycling materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And thus, one day we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic white is used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile keeps a, two seasons, then it is ripe for the locking waste.
For the library, the white - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four inches of thick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loading material that smells a bisl to new car and a bisl to sports shoe.
After 105 stages you arrive at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long hiking you will not only be rewarded in the literature café with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crochets and stuck Ficus trees.
They ensure the atmosphere, especially the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a preview project in ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, the sun shines shortly inside itself on sunny days.
The wide wood laminators, which stand across the glass façade, serve as a shadow and capture a great deal of sunlight.
The room atmosphere is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, dared the way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “sounding soul”.
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every inhabitants were invited to donate a book from their personal inventory.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library – currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, everyone has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the delight.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline called the Identity Foundation of the Jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
As young and untrained she might be.
This is finally a point of approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play greater role"
Germany has refused to vote on Palestine's acceptance of the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-European relations, Berlin balances it to a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
Then Berlin was included.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it doesn’t support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, however without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from the vote when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
It was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to get a clear position on important international topics?
Yeah, that's true.
This is because it just surrounds its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
The fact is that Europeans do not have a consistent and uniform policy.
The Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they are still approaching their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to meet the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to give it too much weight, that’s not a completely single-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relationships with the United States by refraining from the vote in important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That’s why I don’t think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain respect.
Because it signals that it has to be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests need to be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S. has clearly pronounced a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama in secret has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, of course, the government cannot represent this position publicly.
I think the actual differences of opinion are not as large as they always seem.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree with its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have to drive things out of their own position instead.
They just do that with the euro.
I believe Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position in the future.
This is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany feel itself in the role of an important international player - wants Germany to take a major role at all?
Or is Germany still leading?
Germany has not yet been used to, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For instance, when we look at the eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, many anti-German feelings are free.
That doesn’t make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is continuously decreasing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even though they don’t like it, it’s unpleasant to them and makes them even much unpopular - c’est la vie!

"Mark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Becoming Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind that, a name, which is officially registered in China, is hidden but has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual names don’t complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing, specializing in protective infringement in Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators are already a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
Thus, from Gucci, Lu-Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is enrolled.
German companies are also copied in this way legally, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the brand office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are copiing and injured intellectual property.
In the large cities, there are multi-storey stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeit.
However, Pattloh’s cases are different: on behalf of his customers, he claims that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger trademark.
The word focuses on “Bang Dakuan”.
This means women fishing rich men.
Chinese authorities are not aware of guilt
“This is business damaging, you have to fight it,” Pattloch asks.
“The brand is watered, the single setting disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial failures and the process costs of the industries affected go into the millions, especially with expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market in the year with a volume of EUR 15 billion.
However, deleting doubtful entries in the brand register is difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years the procedure can move, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reported cases in which the court deferred appeals because after the long duration of the complained name had become "market trade".
If the applicant has bad, he has to even pay money to the plagiator because he injured his brand in China, Pattloh says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with construction machine manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was sharpened, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which led the famous crocodile to look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of the blame.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that there were too low gaps in 2010 due to too low staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, we have returned from the “North situation in the workflow to normality.”
Thus, the inventory of unprocessed opposition proceedings dropped by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still waiting for completion in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one-third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for tenth time in a row, the authority said.
This also applied to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuans were taken on fees.
This simplifies that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot of times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacturing of imitated vehicle parts was removed.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
It was missing itself because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO has also returned the objection of the Munich.
Although Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, the prosecutor continues to fight until today.
You need to be carefully careful.
The matter is now in front of the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the thing to a good degree, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly accumulated that the company’s archive has even had to check out one hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered in vain a "high six-digit euro" to resolve.
"We see how much that is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the far east even threaten to return to Europe.
Then, if imitators are safeguarding unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has abandoned the group for a long time, yet he could revoke the registration.
“You have to watch holly,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in shops with China.
It is not rich to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should “register everything that is somehow protective, even in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is under the last act of his brand drama, then the counterpart would probably have to pay license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment concerned.
World Aid Day: Stamping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi probs - and in Swaziland Aidswaiss are delighted about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's lipper looking for the tact on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly flash - old, bass, tenor and soprano - beat, deceive and follow themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his shoes when he brings them together with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi has a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, came from the human genetician to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu spoken of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are approximately 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which estimates the UN AIDS program.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS women live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS kids in the village of Esitjeni, the Association Voices for Africa has found patens in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or praising.
The Bantu language can speak fluently no one in this room, but can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir uses songs in this soft foreign language and brings them back and back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
40% are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leather and strawhouses, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because they are inflicting the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the little Swaziland sick is shown: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male prepuce, which demonstrates to reduce the risk of infection by half, is barely accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry immune weakness virus in themselves, dying at mid thirty is not rare.
During a joint African trip in spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which it lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothes, education.
Without a school degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially it was the private commitment to individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which since then almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transferable Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ITS include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral ITS are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Filzluces and crabs are one of the parasitic ITS.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and Tripper occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transferred through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (mushrooms), trippers and human papillomaviruses are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless, about 20 percent of HIV new infections account for this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than among other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
There are also human papillomaviruses frequently occurring in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has fallen since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a gender disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomforts in urination, exhaust, lower womb pain, as well as bubbles or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through furniture infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed most ITS can be cured and avoided late successions.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gaps that the choir comes throughout Germany, a lot of things comes together.
“In total, we have sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and powerful woman, manages money from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to stay well with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof above their heads and ensure that the children appear in their uniforms on time every day for school lessons.
Whoever has no one more, comes to Khanyisile’s protective house, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because so obviously the disease throughout the country is also, you prefer to silence it dead.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute tabu,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The final absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus throughout the country.
While there would be free condoms in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-chor travels every two or three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of wealth, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know at the southern top of the Black Continent still from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and pleasure, but has also drained some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patent children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it lighting there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Merkur
The Messenger Probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as shown in three studies published in the magazine "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger Probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shadow region of the planet.
It is intended to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been hit on Mercury.
No one will bring the find of ice but in connection with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sound, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other buildings of life have reached other areas of the Solar System.
Unnoticed by the earthly citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix in exploring the depths of the space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small watch holes in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Dwarf Planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circulates behind the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This image section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are recognized as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-building region - by scientists unromanticly called W5 - has discovered the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia star image, a distance of 6500 light years.
This brilliant flame of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star threw out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.

Saturn and his rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.

One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, photographs of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European South Star Wait shows the several thousand light-years away Trifid mist in the star image Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), since dark dust stripes are the bright heart of the star birth site.
Astronomers have photographed the predictions of a cosmic carrot: 400 million light years removed from the Earth, the cores of two melting galaxies raw up to each other and will inevitablely conflict with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxy M83.
Whoever technical abbreviations are not, they may call them with their name Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cut from the Iris Nebula in the Kepheus star image.
The 1,400 light years away mist consists of dust grains, which are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary home dust.
This image has been assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring made of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble Space Telescope for the NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
The most bright group of young stars of our Milky Way are located in this star nebula.
The stars are producing new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, combined with the rosette fog, continue to produce new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the emergency when it was found primarily hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights to all: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to be invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei introduced it to the star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes became increasingly larger - and the insights they provide became deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest remote tube in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows eyes to all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height angle.
Its particularity: the high light collection force.
Indeed, it suffices – despite relatively small mirror diameter – to which the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear all of the extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Star Wars (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which makes his name all honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also light up the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to cover 42 meters - and will be set together from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures are expected at the earliest of 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them still looks into the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is expected to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to admire on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from all deliver the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided pictures from far-away worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler’s space telescope is looking for extrasolar planets – especially those inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates were identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the latest launch preparations on the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot in the All by the earliest of 2018 on board an Ariane5 missile.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also ice in the southern pole of Merkur.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is closer to the northern pole around the planet.
For decades, radar arrangements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circulate around Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and getting 168 years old

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountain is called wild-romantic.
The small bus walks through the curved road, passing through densely forested hills, striking rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you can find yourself in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian group of the Talysh, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijan and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is overwhelmed with architecture from Soviet times that doesn’t even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, it is too difficult to reach Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours because the road is only one track.
The delicate wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing for the tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival – and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita documented of about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born
However, a controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children at the age of 136, and he was supposed to have given birth to a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov counted for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the seniors in Central Asia.
“Astonishingly many highly old people are also in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “also in Sardinia, there are very many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since the registry of personal status lacked.
Every day melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people around the region often reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people over 100 years old.
So why do so many seniors live here in the south?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is in the diet.
But that the caloric food of the talys should be so healthy that loves meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of which many drink a glass of melted butter daily, seems not just plausible from a nutritional perspective.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these breadths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butterfish that rolls her tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both are grandparents for a long time.
Two kids also jump around.
In the kitchen tea is served in the typical Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly in rain and limb, under her head towel she hides long, dark blonde pots that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never got out of me and kept their colour.
“I’ve never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten only what was from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
I haven’t bought food once in the supermarket all my life.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the time after World War II.
But everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the ruder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, has hardly known boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the ruder.
There is no need among the old Azerbaijan.
230 manat (approximately the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for the current ratio, an amount from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s greenery son has long been right: “The old enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human right” is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalry protests in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president does not save pathos.
We have to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in a state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian copts, the liberals, Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, hopelessly disrupted in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has temporarily circumcised the skills of the Constitutional Court and expanded his skills to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer who carries a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not fully clear.
Should the judicials be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were beaten in a nightly, 15-hour parforced assembly, are partially concerning.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisdiction is based on the "principes of Islamic law".
What does it mean "principes"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is worried that the Islamists will use the floating formulation and the legal space associated with it for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all matters concerning the Sharia, Al-Ashar University must be drawn to the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiation in all Sunni Islam.
This does not need, but it can mean that the clergy supervises legislation, which would de facto result in the removal of the judiciary.
Many things in the writing design is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress opponents.
After the dictator’s fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, according to the draft, “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote their morality and values.”
This is legally so uncharpified that government institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature using this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article expressly states the equality of men and women.
For this one prohibits the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers from insulting or offended.
But what is an offense and how to be punished remains unclear.
Dubios also mutes the statement that “offense of humans” is prohibited.
Is there enough a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Matter of interpretation how many things are present in the draft, the Mursi for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
“The Revolution has come back”
The opposition has formed for weeks against the over-power of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday night on the Tahrir square in Cairo and pledged to bring the Charter to fall even before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has come back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei said the Constitution draft belongs to "the waste mountain of history".
Via Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis to wish to lead a "pute against democracy".
“When he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and drop him down,” said Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not resolved yet,” the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would become invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, blows to the demonstration of the area, but not cautiously on the Tahrir square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried, "The people call for the enforcement of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the highness over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which everything began, would probably have raised up states like civil war.
Obviously, Mursis followers did not want to risk this.
The Muslim Brothers explained that both the opponents of the constitutional draft and the advocates were loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people at the voting urns decide to what direction the country should go.
A majority of the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even come"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and integrated all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights attorney and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in jail or standing in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, detained.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in discussion with the World on Sunday.
Mursi expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are declaring violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto put it out of force,” Saeda said.
Without civil society organizations a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which considers the ideological directional fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That might be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, “You are feeding a monster that you cannot control anymore.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million Norwegian inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Could the country’s success secret have something to do with the local appetite on pretty badly smelling fish?
Take a selection of overwhelming cheese varieties.
You place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, moist sports clothes.
And leave them there a week.
So approximately you must imagine the nose-buying smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-breasted forel that – depending on how smelly you would like to have your fish – is fermented in water up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather becomes cold, Norwegians flow to a party here in Fagernes dedicated to this, now, really very best-speaking speciality.
“You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firewall, but also organizes the festival as the so-called ‘Rakfisk General’.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
“Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” Havard says.
Spiritus can suppress the smell.
I'm taking a few pieces.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it’s not bad - like sushi that has a pretty long bus trip behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poor Norwegian epoch, when there was no cooling options yet and fish was drinked in air-proof salt water bottles in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and, undoubtedly, consumed senses suppressed by alcohol.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians looked forced to leave their country and moved mainly to the United States.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, shocked by a flourishing labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is considered something important – an essential, though strictly ridiculous part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a little glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to name Anders Breivik – those racist right-wing extremists who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the “accident of 22 July”.
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for today’s wealth in Norway has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re so good,” says Anna, our housekeeper, who distributes round tablets with ripe Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and blue eyes.
We are, as one says, a prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We aren't very lovely, we don't like prayers.
Norway has been treated very carefully with its oil-richness - a large part of the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years until the global economic crisis everyone threw around with money that they didn’t even possess, Norway held its wallet closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” Anna says.
"And of course, eating Rakfisk," she adds with uncomfortable laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else, the juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening, the stinkey fish is on the food schedule again.
The hotel I accommodate is one of several places that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the smell senses most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit towards a showmaster dressed with fly, surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're crying and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict dust of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto is facing difficult start
While Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant by the BBC analyzes the challenges he’s coming and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a constantly shut down city, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which blocks several important routes of transport to the capital and ensures chaos on the roads.
The aim was, however, not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take over the nation’s leadership.
He stands in front of a complex task.
Under the departure government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under control of a drug war that has already costs 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office early this week.
I will suggest a new security strategy that allows us to achieve this goal.
Before he went up with the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was a governor of his home state in Mexico.
In this densely populated, widespread part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo you like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the resort explain to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that made Pena Nieto build and which represent a great improvement compared to the broke, hollow roads there was once.
Plaques with his name are also hanging outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect from him genuine and ongoing changes,” says his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressmen for the PRI Party Pena Nietos.
In particular, with regard to security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congress member Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years, the party places great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto outside the Los Pinos Presidential Palace.
The charges of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but especially he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be larger.
The place is hidden under highway transitions and in many ways represents a vicinity of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Early this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage depony, dozens of murdered women have been left alone over the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, a statistic that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
Criticians Pena Nietos believe that he has not addressed the problem of women's killings at least during his terms of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed his eyes from the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical of the downward neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana made suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her lifemate.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse stars had already used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the wall on us. It is attached next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But exactly this one, the family, has been rejected until now.
The authorities treated me as if I was a swollen girl, a troubleshooter, a northern girl.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth.
“But this is not possible if there were so many shape errors and failures,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential binding on Saturday, he also takes great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his term.
"I hope he is as president as he was as governor," said Olvera, PRI Congress Member in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The Attorney says Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
Bradley Manning's prosecution against he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defence seeks to reject the charge due to too hard detention conditions
The U.S. Army is accused of removing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor’s office on Friday tried to note that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military detention.
During a cross-examination of Mannings during a prejudicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents for weekly visits made by prison officials during Mannings nine months’ detention in Quantico, Virginia did not complain about his treatment.
A day before the cross interrogation, which was held as a result of a request for defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention time - had said Manning had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army’s intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stoling thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his quantitative military prison, where he had settled in enhanced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine interviewed him on Friday with the forms, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the institution as a whole as “very professional”.
The forms, so Fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials Manning had directly asked about his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and stated to deal with them, but they were not logged.
"They wrote (after the meeting of concerns) "no problems" and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Counter Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that should investigate the suicide thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status for the "prevention of injuries".
The military said it has assigned him this restrictive status - a stage under suicide risk - to his own and to protect others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and moved to Kuwait, where he was arrested nearly two months before he was moved to the prison of the Quantico Marine Basis in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered the suicide in Kuwait and once became unconscious due to the heat.
Not to know what happens to him or in the outside world, whether it was burdening.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
They allowed him only a mattress, a ceiling, flip flops, clothes, and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in movement because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie.
He always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
If he turned at night and guards couldn’t see his face anymore, he was awakened so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally opposed Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also interviewed an accusation he made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity during this counting to cover himself with his ceiling.
During the interrogation on Friday, Manning said he had closed from a command of his guard that he should leave the ceiling he could have covered with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning told him that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not at risk for himself.
Manning told the official that he could use the covenant of his underwear or his flip flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His attorneys hope that the judge will at least take into account his happy experiences and drastically reduce his detention, if he should be sentenced in his trial before the military court, which is set for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will confess himself for less offences, while other accusations that are considered too extreme should be accused.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend and the prosecutor's justification of the detention conditions is expected.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held in Quantico under the highest safety measures.
Accusations against Manning include the advantage of the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he threatens a lifelong prison sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the migrants - they call them to memory of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are captured between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at passport check when ratelessness became broad in me.
Signs referred to two waiting lines: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexicans" throughout my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ireland" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided to be "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or binding paintings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent I won’t get rid of either.
So I took my American passport and put myself into the snake for foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda was on all the topics that we expect when the minds of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason that Mexicans today remain in Mexico with equally high probability rather than emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the European Union's example.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico’s war against drug cartels, even if he did not call any details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of ressentiment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under a pistol to leave more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be forgotten.
So once an U.S. government official exert only mild criticism of Mexico, it is heard – in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country – complaints about how the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge is actually in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents part - had no chance in Mexico and emigrated towards north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, visited good schools, and received good jobs, we must never lose the eyes that it is the American dream we live – not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes perhaps dizzy, but as to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership layer do not like.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a reminder of a humble defeat and look down upon us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves behind the silk cloak now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans I know feel neither belonging to one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
In the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to re-establish their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a temporary "ambassador" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their bonds with Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, unregulated corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through alone, friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to grant the United States for dealing with Mexico a centuries and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grief for how their family members were treated just so long ago.
Hmm.
Perhaps we’re “mexicaner” than I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
Fire ceasefire between Israel and Hamas might prove to be an unexpected baseline for peace
Can there ever be ongoing peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to blow such a hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were placed in ruin and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them killed civilians, and six Israelis - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were taken near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be captured in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more blood shedding.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patch situation could finally find its end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems not to be appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, these weekly struggles have strengthened the hard soda on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claimed to have pushed Israelis back, although its grouping itself had to have great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza Strip are inhabited in one of the most devastated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a re-powered regional power, once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up for the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas followers believe that a Islamic half-moon is formed around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has the power to over Syria, where rebels could stand a more and more Islamic stamp before the collapse of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas ally threatens the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitant and most important Arab country - on the southern flange of Israel has sustained the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall in 2011 for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood is confused with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas might prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States themselves.
The Israeli hardlines, on the other hand, leave an opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States stands insufficiently in its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has done it well in recent years, especially with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide, not least thanks to the closure plants that fall into the West Bank and therefore into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements, although they have been declared unlawfully of international law.
Netanyahu stands well. His Likud party has allied himself with an even more fighting group in the prior elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why also these false Palestinians defeat and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not shoot missiles just like their co-fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to hold and punish them behind the wall in chess, they should dare lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to put themselves into force, but the Arab spring could make them a little bit by the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense state of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments repair their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi meets with Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer.
While the remaining Arab world takes sharp steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their self-determination right - a powder trap that will undoubtedly one day explode into the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Suppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to remove Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outward boost.
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and the newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for safety purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, complemented by territorial exchange and a joint Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be more done for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for the UN observer status.
Obama also has to contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term he failed to introduce his own peace plan.
A far away in the white house it seems like he was also denied a participation.
But this is a sad, short-looking perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation for uniform cigarette packaging enters into force
Health alerts and sick body parts on neutral green packages that are equal to all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green covers, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and infants and children with cigarette smoke.
Aside from the different health alerts and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names are printed in identical, small fonts from Saturday.
This means that Australia implements the most strict tobacco packaging regulations in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government is out of studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 are not going to start with 99% likelihood even afterwards.
“You can even see in young children that they understand the message of trying to apply tobacco companies with their brand image,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby struggled hard against laws.
It said that the laws would favor black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that demand for cigarettes and silicone covers has increased enormously to cover unbearable packaging since British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan’s Tobacco Group denied the highest Australian Court of Justice two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and waited for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies in exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from playing as sports sponsors and forced most traders to no longer interpret cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has been switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to advertise his products will not come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by “all normal people”.
Is this just a private person who finds such a great favor to Marlboro cigarettes that they even take a video for it, or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focuses on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to dispute the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to describe photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are reluctant.
The pictures don’t affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a stick and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade “King of the Pack” in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
“Formerly I took an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
“The government should have completely banned cigarettes – then we would have told ourselves okay, that’s it, we’re making it close,” he adds.
In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be bored even once.
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane fell due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day for a flight at the airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and of course tax-free shopping).
But increasingly more academics and child development experts conduct boredom than something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly look at one or another screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
I'll be back once again.
Like many people, I have always believed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't look like that.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti over boredom that comes from the first century.
And then there is still the question how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to conclude that boredom as the experience of wanting to perform a satisfactory activity but cannot define this.
Boredom differs from apathy as a result that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need for apathy to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, stands in a “disturbance of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time only goes slowly.”
Boredom can be listening to almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, boring people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we’re boring, even if we just have difficulty focusing.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in September in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to a previous article in which a participant listent a person.
Some groups heard a loud television show from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the content; others stopped it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
People who heard this hardly hearable television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble focusing, couldn’t find any reason for them and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or stressful task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a single-tone activity – “as well as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor tape, you can distract music and help not feel bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappels and crystals, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by remaining more physically attentive people.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hampe around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point – my late flight, a loud speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people get easier bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale to boredom vulnerability".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more often boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University - especially regarding the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teens are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and his parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults were bored at school and when doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they were not at school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know whether the percentage of boredom has risen or dropped.
However, he is sure that “youth is felt particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers don’t have a great influence on their everyday life.
So back to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes it doesn’t, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them – this has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has explored the topic for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do the best right now.
If you’re boring and you’re using this energy to play and cook guitar, you’ll be happy.
But although television can make sense of happiness in the short term, they are displaced in the long term again.
So whoever gives his bored child an iPad can get it off from boredom, but he has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other.”
The child learns not only to entertain, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we should celebrate boredom.
We shouldn’t see them too critically either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even beyond the constant activity and technology enlargement.
Professor Eastwood agrees to this.
"It sounds like we should be more often boring, but boring is the tormented, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment in which we are constantly over-stimulated, it’s hard to deal with when the noise is silent.”
There is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in court in Southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana breaks and a pipe he smoked with.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was pre-charged for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier crimes, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state’s decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than on the site.
Hundreds of injustices around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer track adults over 21 years of age for small possessions, which will be permitted by law as soon as new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced to continue tracking existing marijuana crimes and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, vote to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation evolves so quickly that I don’t know what will happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, eastern Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching on their head.
They are waiting for guidance for the establishment of a license system for the production, manufacturing, sale and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in every case ahead of most states as to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized only for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and the state is therefore well suited for orientation,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve in the sense of a gross guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent we can follow,” he adds.
Washington’s law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the endpoint of a grey zone where the state license system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues must be clarified at this time - for example, how the state’s designation of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis transactions within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in town areas, especially in Seattle’s county area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “Center for Legal Cannabis,” a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an email in which he stated that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana crimes in persons over 21 and that the police would "from now" not seek any criminal charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to apply urban requirements to regulate medical marijuana farmers, and drug dealers will continue to be pursued.
In Weld County, North Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to track cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been accused of other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue violations that were crimes at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are twice in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiatives.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer show adults for possessing smaller quantities.
District Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’ll waste my time to enforce the right until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the action, it was already clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree with the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound difference among local officials in terms of the great green experiment to days.
For district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer, who represents accused for marijuana crimes in court and acts on site as spokesman for the National Marijuana Reform Organization.
“They have spent such a large part of their lives in prosecuting people criminally that they still cannot accept legalization,” he says.
As the first states that treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for the Federal Government’s instructions that continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Representatives of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, Obama’s former Drug Policy Advisor, believes that although criminal officials are likely not going to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to strike themselves that will sustain legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several towns in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved Moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided to be a six-month ban, probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment to the law.
We are focusing on what the municipality has chosen, not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was committed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had again packed my suitcases and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
At Evening Standard, I said I had gone because I had a problem with comrades having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson explained shelmingly that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I went away.
Yeah, I was running because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my fairly unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
Only for one reason I had been scared — one reason that in this alleged weight of enlightenment seemed so narrow and cruel: my now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatchers and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
According to current reports, a new generation of students of the moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred on tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that a group of them calls for the same equality protection that benefits gays, disabled and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and unwanted due to their political views."
They call for a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentric and neonazis.
It showed, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drived in a Rolls-Royce and protruded with silver-colored suit and silver-occupied walkstock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered as "sinners for the introduction of higher education fees".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is an increasing left trend at universities.
“People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club without meeting.”
The 21-year-old Samuel Roberts and a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "uncomfortable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says she has observed growing refusal to students of the moderate rights at JCR members.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discussion and the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly embarrassing 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
Hate to the Conservative Party had reached its highlight.
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher - a former student - to not give honor title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even shocked Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students and tutors met, I got a pre-taste for future events.
I experienced that the tutors participated in the mock of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy.
Political topics such as the mining strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the tutorial’s wood-tabled spaces.
During my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and what should then happen was not written.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled at it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake tea, and pretty hostile.
“Do Thatcher’s fans refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes there were tears.
"I suggest that they take a few hours of French in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt said.
I returned to my room with a hungry head.
That evening I sat at college alone at dinner when someone easily tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who imagined himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's how it's.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be condemned.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semesters claim to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to settle.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher at all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A study beginner in philosophy, politics and economy, who ironicly visited Eton College as a conservative, told me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How did Tories sex?” one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people until the darkness breaks down?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me stretched before my mental eye into a fire of expression and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for him.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small-carried, and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic perspective of history.
In 1997, he took a teacher at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started pending between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed to be unbelievers.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of the dreaming tower tips.
Even my communist friends have always put fine ways on the day.
His moist eyes were troubled.
Give the whole a chance.
I'm sure you're just necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory’s fans, had given up the pressure and declined his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history tutor seriously claimed I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly cracked off shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain laundry," and called them "old fool."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes my kids abandoned.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can be happy to call me a wine-free sweatshirt.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and maliciousness in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hid behind an unworthy reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemakers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stiff and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until 3 March, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most selected aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophys of his social ascension from the modest modemakers in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with nobility doesn’t have to be of disadvantage.
“For the most part, they don’t put their clips out on your magnificent carpet, as it does some beautiful celebrities from pop music,” says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
“We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemakers.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, we recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited felt important and loved,” recalls the top model, which began their career in the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she finally says.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of consciousness, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest title, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long running track that suggests a role exchange: the user takes the square of the model and walks along the track to admire a stunning "audition" that wears the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that belongs to the Jackie Kennedy for their wedding with Monsites.
In this audience, names from fashion dolls are named by Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillet" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," the ex-Duke of Feria adds.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even Princess and Leader of Fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
At the end of the 1990s it eventually came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festivity in my grandfather’s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the modemakers "with absolute care" because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it.
The "King" of Fashion
The great final of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzes" (as the modemakers called his neighbors) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-half-metre-long swing.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the senior authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society."
For years with the savoir-être of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the honourable legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
“I’ve always noticed his refinement, his rest, his well maintained and perfect exterior,” says D’Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was unclean; the time leaves no traces on him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at stake when they carry 70 pounds of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers deserving their lives by bringing sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, he must climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the Earth reinforces in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo basks on his shoulders over the abstract paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in turtle speed, maintaining the balance and keeping their steps carefully so that they do not slide and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who stumbled years ago on the stairs of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen’s mining workers earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulfur they decrease.
Arriving above, they bathe the path between the tourists who are photographing like circus monkeys and running with the fatiguously heavy baskets three kilometres to the balance, which a mining company set a little further down at an elevation of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the presences in the volcano and (never better told) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulfur.
This is then selling for 10,000 rupee (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacturing of stemwoods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleach of sugar.
“Because we usually carry 70 kg, we get approximately 46,000 rupies (3.8 euros) for every path,” Anto explains.
For each route he takes three hours, which he has completely achieved, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort is, however, the triple of what he would deserve with field work.
“The daily wage of the mine workers here, where the coffee harvest is paid for 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” explains the carrier who previously worked as a tourist maker on the island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work wasn't so hard, but Anto returned to Banyuwangi, a nearby village with his family, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, chests frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, frequently hustles and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two years again because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,” he promised in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who is punished by life might work as a tourist guide, cabinet or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a babysitter.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at 2 o'clock, because the sulphur flows out even at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he rises in the crater in the light of a small front lamp on his helmet that he bought himself from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its big profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur decrease to save costs, and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their own invoice and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupies (2.5 euros) per photo apparatus supplemented by the guards of this natural park along with the entry fee of 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) from tourists who come to photographing the volcano and the human tragesel.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working since three decades leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to wear up to 110 kg and assures that he continues to "as long as it goes" because he takes the money to educate his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers climb into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one is complaining of severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubs on the shoulders.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to wear 50 kg at his 53 years old.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the Tamansari camp in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth widely, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a sulphur carrier.
The time passes, but the poverty keeps generation-to-generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: the one of those who work as a human loader on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens are pushing the blame for having no children, on the career, stress and costs of real estate and childhood education.
“The population of Singapore has to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: fulfill our citizenship obligation and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbons, but nevertheless – or just because of this – they became a viral video in Singapore at the beginning of this year on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs like, for example, "swipe a "bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has shot the video, keeps the hope that the advertising spot will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty".
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When cultivating, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it is a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had attempted a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromons or organizing speed dating events (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not lead to success.
Therefore, we thought, “Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?”
1.2 Children
Anyone who doesn’t easily take this issue is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 for policies to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do Singaporens not get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says this is due to "better education" and "larger career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities, except for marriage and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of individuals and to the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where hardly casted xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for holding wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election results since the independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the declining birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax income, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government tries to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, it is worried that they can promote the lifestyle of the alone, and that they are afraid of building companies from building large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sell much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers who previously had been put in the path obstacles when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could make the way to an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district is to see that they will not have a significant effect.
“People are heavily stressed, the apartments and also education are expensive, so it is thrown out by many,” a young manager says.
Children can get others.
“For me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women conduct their career, stress and costs for property and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That’s why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - the government can still do so much.
The private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life, where you have the right to protect against any type of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself when he makes known on the Internet situations he wouldn’t share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very own” at personal level and “to password and user” when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t announce my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge attempting to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother must know her, but not the whole world,” he said.
I upload to FB beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not from me, or from someone who makes the stupid,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone answers me, I just invite them up,” he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives on the distance or with friends,” he said.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he acknowledges not to know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
“This doesn’t scare me because we have something common, for example music,” he says.
After giving the boy, no one made any suggestions or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“If anyone presses me or asks them for me, I just remove him from my user account,” he said.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy’s experiences are not unknown today known as cyberbullying.
A girlfriend’s acquaintances were expressed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He has never known who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
Afterwards, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathic to me or I want to clean him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a higher educational degree in education and learning, believes that to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform them.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the game rules have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in pedagogy at Yale University, and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we still learn ourselves,” he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where the maturity is not sufficient to this."
“They should also be selective when it’s most important to them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that lead them to thinking.
"Saying they shouldn't do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls a few ways: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, then why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like publishing a photo of you, like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you label photos of celebrations?
And another question: Does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to tell you that you have to trade online as you do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet is acting with respect, sitness and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, basic school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the policies of the social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what to share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children have to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
The conclusion of the Summit of Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced previously and theoretically should be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of the Unasur, but sources in the State and Presidential Chancellor initially informed that they would pass it after the Clausur, but subsequently declared that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
For questions about the text, they stated that the content was depicted by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press spokesmans of some of the governments present at the meeting of Unasur, but not from Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which created discomfort among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that demanded more information.
Then the President’s Office of Peru sent the media an email with the “Declaration of conclusion” of the summit, but it was Humala’s Declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even at this occasion, despite the urgent call by the press, the so-called declaration of Lima, which was previously announced, was not published.
On the official website of ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities emphasized that information systems would be available for journalists, but they highly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of Den Haag, which involved a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in Den Haag, in the process of inducing Lima against Santiago to listen to the calls of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we present to this International Court," Humala and his Chilean counter said.
“Chile was, is and remains a country that comply with international laws, seeks peaceful dispute solutions, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts,” Piñera adds and greeted Humala with a hand pressure before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the IGH was made after Colombia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which felt it was a serious mistake, had filed a lawsuit against the Bogota Agreement, in which it was agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo was dismissed, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit in Lima shortly after midnight.
The head of state left the final document, which reported that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries on a total investment amount of $17 billion.
He said that the countries of the Unasur will "take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we expand the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in cities and the organized cross-country crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) cannot take triumphful traits, but is intended to expand our production performance and show our people a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects to improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, living on the queraches of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighborhood relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before he began attending the regional meeting, said he expected a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respect the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
“Possibly, tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We will check all of these ways - they are not excluding, and the agreement with Nicaragua also make negotiations with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the block’s ministers of defence met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, in which dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region are intended to be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even though the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the chairmanship at the time of the regional block.
“Southern America needs to learn in the integration of citizens,” says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with "Southern America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), took place in Lima, declared to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were killed "in the Second World War and in other disputes" and "today practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the intention of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as an appeal to the political asylum Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had complyed with his “deep democratic values and views on human rights.”
He added that there had been “grounded assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice that requested him to undergo a question in his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisdiction allows this through a video conference that could have been executed via the Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that the danger would be that Assange’s health and mental condition would be impaired.
"Since he is in our embassy, I didn't talk to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious problem," Ecuador said.
However, there is a danger that he would take physical and mental damage because he was captured in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa said that the solution for the asylum, which Assange has been granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June, was the grant of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of proceedings on various European instances," he said.
"If Britain grants this letter morning, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or via Skype, how the Swedish jurisdiction was allowed and in other cases made, the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he doesn’t tolerate, “moderacy, evil intention, and lie that remove freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of freedom of press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and express earnings,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists, nor is it dominated by bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries, and anticipated that in a re-election he “will deepen the revolution to continue the path in that right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organization must remain “hard and must not take place no opportunism and no legally dressed assault,” because “the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.”
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian opposite, Juan Manuel Santos, now and according to the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which advocated the maritime state power of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua for "absolutely entitled to negotiate the maritime boundaries between the two countries."
Currently, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court, and said that “it is right for Latin America to call for international instances when both countries commit to accept the judgment even if it is very hard.”
In terms of the possibility he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he argued that he "sees this possibility with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I that guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I get away from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
“This is decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuela’s Vice-President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean a return to President Chávez's health status," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Heads of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS Death is Today Too Late Detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "weakening" without a recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such a commitment that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigmata.
At the time, the director of a clinic of the IMSS himself missed goodbye, "because it led to a sacred track."
Then AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is also possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the Head of HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that information was considered scientifically this April.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease and HIV/AIDS specialist, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depart from the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater chances that would not have to be CD4 to a year of 50.
Simply, the statements above mean that whoever receives HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25, in this sense, “can be 75 years old without any problem as long as he is under control,” said the expert.
In order to correctly arrange this progress, we must remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011), it is nevertheless right that since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why are people still dying about it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is it in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that people come in a far advanced condition because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
"Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have accompanied infection. In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnosis is required, which is why all people who are required must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees with the professionals and officials of the Council Estatal de Prevención del AIDS en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and with the patients like Fabrizio who had carried out his test at a private laboratory, and this is for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who was already in his young age of AIDS.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die and don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, then I’d rather break three times,” he says in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
“I work, do much, have an active but responsible sex life, I look at my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agrees to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS Day.
The earlier you know if you are HIV-positive, the better you know, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to live responsibly like everyone.
His news is a summary of the struggle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important thing is preventing.
“The distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who don’t have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the people who risk new infections are young people.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread spot question of social workers, education staff in schools, pharmacies and health care workers who do not want to expose young people.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table, but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid for them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like this; the best thing is to bring the condoms closer to those who already perform sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is on the 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS cases, and on the 13th place of HIV.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities reached through a trade competition in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has had payment problems.
Therefore, it could be said that the survival procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws have no validity in the country of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale on 15 June at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads to the Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the failure law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, first says that the main procedure is the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity to payment of companies with cross-country profiles is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was established for the unification of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being used as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the societies, after recognition of the bankruptcy liabilities that Vitro’s subsidiaries had with their parent society, it would not have been achieved the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed among group companies by the Federal Instituto de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstituto de Commercial Concursos).
It is also right that after the deduction of the firms' votes, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Geiers funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote was expected to be 45% compared to 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is blameful for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the large economic crisis in the United States that beats the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada objects to the same appeal court in order to vote in the plenary, i.e. all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare complaint shall be filed, which requests the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority in this case is that the Court has left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Trade Course Act, and in which it is pointed out that it was strictly held in accordance with the United States agreements signed by the two countries.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for the cases of cross-border invalidity that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band karamboles: a hit for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican trade unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not move forward several months, the Association Union of Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilot Union) has finally made progress.
The request led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, charged with the disability of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic’s headquarters of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove from the trust account F/589 of Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares by the Administradora Professional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we talk about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplementing a living area for employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has reached to unite the Governors in the Southeast to resist the monumental institution that destroyed partly protected areas and represents the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English ACTA abbreviation, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because he considered them as a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without impairing short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings exchange certificates over 500 million pesos to the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise a payment of interest every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Trained from NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, was founded a group under the name Competival, whose aim is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, the world bumbler of the basketball, was connected to the basketport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large mental collection of the history of the country’s basketball like Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón, or President of the Basketball Association.
“My lifetime I’ve put many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled when he visited Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived with his faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not overcome this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-business manager or manager of the club.
“This was my best years that I’ve enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as CEO, co-business manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships successively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I say goodbye with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 meters large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who left himself a citizen and was one of our best launchers.
I still remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a Bayamon championship, Gausse would take care of another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy’s executions in the national team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time in the Pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then the 1990 World Cup came, where we held the fourth place, what bronze should really have been, if not that Canadian arbitrator, who made us repeat the last train for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered a fight to the U.S. team, as when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and made us great joy, was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicia and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different ligaes in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else to do with you?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, children make unnecessary many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I love listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and going to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always next to me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, injustice and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Thanksgiving Festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and episode series, was at Hagman when he died in the hospital of Dallas, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived in full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drinked a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known as a nice guy on television in 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of NBC television facility.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose lives are put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dchinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His movie works included the criticism's well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly hateful J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing Clan and other characters in its surrounding area was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising statement "Who shot J.R.?", expecting an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who transformed "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the daughter of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swallowed her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she didn’t leave the city, but others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a fraudulent businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the grave stone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "here the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing rests."
This is the only business he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a “enormous personality on and outside the screen.”
He is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts to us who had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the broadcaster reported.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she had Larry during her marriage with attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, then he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many famous people reside.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I thought it could harm someone or affect him in any way," the Associated Press said.
After liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are coming up and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them a little comfort, such as "do not fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to be good for you."
Likewise, he went against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the teacher of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backcount" of the Maya calendar on December 21, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudamarghedon”, as well as a growing conflict with Israel’s participation, the place from which Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were away 30 days, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad thing is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer courses about the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
At the University of Pennsylvania's main campus, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a joining Professor of Art History and Anthropology, formed a team to offer a simple course called "The End of the World".
"We don't take up in 2012 so that we always can keep the option to re-leave the course in the event the world doesn't fall," Restall said.
Despite the "previous breakdown" students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final examination is carried out on the evening of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no chance to “continue working until the night where the world is allegedly going to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“There were no places in two hours anymore,” Restall told about his course for high-average students filling with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked whether seats were still free.
Students insure that the course is among the most interesting ones.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers’ Camps for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains for psychology and nursing to have seen all apocalyptic films.
“I have never heard anything about a lesson where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed—and less a professor—explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is only one key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He noted, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that returns several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculation.
“People elsewhere don’t think so,” he says.
This is mostly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as a suggestion of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a mercy from the Pope.
Restally noted that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Many said they want to go to celebrations about “the end of the world”.
"I might call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
