Members of the Wales Assembly worryed about “being puppets”
Welsh elects are consterned by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal comes from the draft amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Wales Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be laughed.
An elected worker said his group is worried about the fact that the silk “rimes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: in Wales, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" for a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Wales, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, stated that “the final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly comes to them.”
The 2007 Government of Wales Act (Government of Wales Act) grants the Wales Assembly the power to modify its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as a Wales Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of the title of the members, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Gallois prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly issue other suggestions, but the effort to achieve consensus could be a true breakthrough for the President of the Assembly Elin Jones, which should submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include additional amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name of “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decade-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long been insisting on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighboring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of St. Martin reduced to silence
“The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and church at every corner of street,” says Adams.
“There is nothing anymore today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars were rare.
Today, “we no longer frequent each other in the same way,” he explains.
“Before, we went to the bar like his neighbor, but that’s no longer the case.”
As for churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will exhaust long before the officials imagine, and that concerns him: “Soon or later, they will return to the starting box.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the latest sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will mostly be the white people who will rush the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members of them,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The initial white methodist congregation left the places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was recovered by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the leading shopping streets in Harlem, in which the blacks were painting to be employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Father Johnson's walls were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon.
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor people.”
Tiffany Ng (Michigan University), the professional who played it in July, gave her a whole different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
She also mentions that it is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the biggest carillon in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that St. Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, it has been a lot concerned about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a body of leaders composed of secular officials, reported to the diocese that it was worried that the diocese wishes to impose the costs incurred, although it did not participate in recruitment of professionals.
Some parishes have deplored the lack of transparency from the diocese.
California: 13-year-old teenager wounded by shark in a fishing part in the homard
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old last Saturday when he was fishing in homard, California, on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego’s television channel, that he was diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting and began paying to him to get him out of the water.
Initially, Chad thought that the young boy was shouting of joy for having had a shot, and then he realized that he actually
had been bitten.
When he arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicule.
“I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!”, explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of sharks that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, chief rescuer Larry Giles told that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami to Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for safety reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's handmade low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fill them with beams similar to those of supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by domain specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, wider beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves to be conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offers to up to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will first include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also refreshes its makeup line Boutique to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly higher criterion among young consumers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and a second whose opening is scheduled during the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders must grow their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their online purchases and to go to proximity shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the sales points will be increasingly similar to large surfaces, as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, allowed to drive sales of current consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructuring the British chain’s pharmaceutical and cosmetic item rays were a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots, but ended after a controversy about the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
After 3 years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for a total of 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Business Director, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer framework.
“We also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of need and, thanks to the beauty of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our cosmetic market dominance is now unquestionable and changes purchasing habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones’ Anger After Holly Willoughby’s Withdrawal from £11 Million Agreement
Dragon's Den, Peter Jones' star, after announced the withdrawal of animator Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million linked to his home decoration brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the indoor decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
A 37-year-old, This Morning’s animator announced on Instagram that she retired.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den furious, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration in the last minute, to dedicate herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry when the beloved child of the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the seat of the Dragon's Den Commercial Empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million sterling pounds, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the estimated £11 million fortune value.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram she left Truly, Jones jumps into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was far one of Holly’s priorities.
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without voice.
No one could imagine what would happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with products ready to be sold.”
Specialists believe that the departure of the animator of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most “banking” celebrities, could cause millions to lose the company, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles, clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, relatives of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples left together on vacation and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and takes the place of Ant McPartlin as the animator of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that he doesn’t want to comment on his business.
The debate was heavy, but we finally loved
Trump mocked the media that criticize him because of his comments that some think “a president is unworthy” and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking a voice of TV journalist.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been supporting a second meeting, after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are nearly dead.
Over three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told global leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that they did not see any U.S. “correspondent response” to North Korea’s early disarmament measures.
He regrets that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his gathering speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“It’s all right with North Korea,” the North American president said.
We broke up the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting trials, the release of hostages, and the remains of North American military returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's just more than 200 standing in front of me," he said.
Tsunami: Devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shake Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10% of Lombok’s population has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a requirement for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have many times clearly stated that they did not want international aid, which makes things a little complicated,” Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization set up a team to go to Palu, she still doesn’t know whether field work will be allowed.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the tremblings it is constantly undergoing, the country lacks cruel means to protect itself from nature’s caprices.
Refugees were arranged in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was communicated, no alarm sirene remained in Palu, which probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not easy.
Natural disasters make transport use more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to cure the victims is now on the road to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed infrastructure reform at the center of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable amounts to restore roads and railways into statements.
The lack of funding, however, undermined the government of Mr. Joko, who called for representation before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state also undergoes pressures related to the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, on the bottom of clashes on the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool Attacker Daniel Sturridge Equalizes Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat in Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second poll.
The ball flows above the repair surface before moving to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up to Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
“I was simply trying to place myself, grab my ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to earn a maximum of time,” Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante approached to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1 to 0 at half-time after a goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker hit a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before leaving to the middle of the field and sprintering on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick go-and-coming in the middle of the field,
Then he performed a beautiful deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pot, with a left foot shot behind the Liverpool gateholder, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the group phase of the Champions League, Wednesday at 15 a.m. at the San Paolo Stadium of Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 5 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Indonesia: The number of victims of tsunami is 832
The disaster management agency reported Sunday morning that earthquake and tsunami reports 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are stuck under the decays of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shaked the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, the spokesman of agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was sealed with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrests a 32-year-old man suspected of hitting a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's corpse was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman beaten with knife shots was discovered in John Street of Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urged the inhabitants of the neighborhood who had seen or heard something to provide their testimony.
The police captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just started, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspect of contacting us.
I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something about their dashcams, and ask them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property she resided in.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman appeared at the crime locations and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is underway and the police reported that it reported the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police allowing nobody to enter or exit the building.
The news left him without voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the whole sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
Repeating, “It’s too horrible.”
At 4 p.m., two police trucks were placed inside the cord, and another outside.
Several agents watched the building on the inner side of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call the 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Failure Agency at 0800 555 111, as indicated in the Registry 247 of September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick’s proposal “unreasonable” and called it “revisionist attempt.”
Cromwell Society Chairman John Goldsmith said, “Given the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that that of Oliver Cromwell erected in front of the Westminster Palace would not be saved.
Cromwell did not order or conduct the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that one had sacrificed his person for the actions committed by his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate.”
Mr. Goldsmith said: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressures, I mean, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated.”
China: Pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as Mr, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery tranched and covered with blood near a pork in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post said Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pork shell, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan nearby province on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the neighboring porch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flows from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the 250 kg weight animal has mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were cracked and covered with blood.”
Safety cameras show Mr. Yuan arrived on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig originating in the death of Mr. Yuan did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked to avoid any other incident and allow police officers to gather evidence.
The farmer's family Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a wife and her husband, severely hurting her.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig caught a Wales farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get it away.
In 2012, while a Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is in principle not an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“These are animals rather players,
Curious kids... they have no intention to hurt.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he says.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeast of the United States
According to the forecast, the Rosa hurricane is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to blasts in the northeast of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
The winds blow at 135 km/h (category 1) hurricane since 5 a.m., Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, the Rosa hurricane will lead to intense tropical moisture to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with approaching depression will create widespread torrent rains in the south-west during the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden raw dangerous, debris flows, and potential ground slides in the desert.
The beaches will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of the Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains may cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly unsuggested to adventure in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into decayed rivers and storms will produce wind rails and dust turbines in places.
The closer depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
Rainbow totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris melts and make the shoe sliding.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical horses will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall all corners of the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature changes are expected for the month of October throughout the United States due to the refreshment of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropes will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change in time on short distances.
The central U.S. region, which will suffer from considerable temperature gaps on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the center and eastern United States is expected to experience an early month of hot October, with temperatures rotating around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Several day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the eastern United States during the first fifteen of October.
Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the striking hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses her of sexual assault in the 1980s, have been followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continued, broadcasting services have stopped their usual Friday program to announce a theater coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to enable the FBI to conduct an investigation of the accusations for a week.
Faced with the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh, as a result of alcohol, had surrendered to his person and tried to remove his clothes on a evening between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tournament, also claimed to be 100% certain that it had never happened.
According to a report by Nielsen, the trial probably reached a audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen doesn’t always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on the hearing day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC occupied second place with an audience reaching 3.26 million.
Followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), according to Nielsen.
The interest did not fail once the hearing was completed.
Flake was in the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken partly by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to go to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake dropped his eyes for several minutes, while CNN broadcasted the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women launches.
Do you really believe he says the truth?
You hold power while so many women are demunised.”
Before the lift doors were closed, Flake said that his office issued a statement and he would say more at the meeting of the commission.
All cable and broadcast network channels covered the live meeting a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote for the proceedings to advance the entire Senate appointment of Kavanaugh.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the charges made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake left partially convinced himself by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy in the balance, because the Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s charges of sexual assault.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making “small politics”
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his plan of leaving the European Union, making the “small politics” to the detriment of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a picture of Theresa May in coverage, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be the cause of LSU player’s death
Police arrested a suspect of fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketballer.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was broken down and accused of murder at the second degree, Baton Rouge police office said.
The authorities published a video of the Sims and Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims had lost glasses during the altercation.
Found at crime locations, the glasses were wearing Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his caution was fixed at $350,000.
The lawyer’s office of the Baton-Rouge parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a injury by a bullet that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Medical Legal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement forces for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and shocked” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We are afraid of this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: A volcano scratches ashes
Ash escaped from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended Mexicans to move away from the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several crowds and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano level located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shocked the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists in approach to the anniversary of vote for independence
Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independentist demonstrators and the anti-agitative police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repelled by anti-emuting police officers, masked separatists threw them eggs and colourful powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not displease tourists.
The police also broke out later in the day, while the police used matracks to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who scanned “neither forget nor forgiveness” faced unionist supporters screaming “long life in Spain.”
14 protesters who had mild injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the October 1st referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans favourable to separation, tensions remain alive in the independentist region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, opponents of the secession have largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the voting offices in the region.
Independentist groups had camped Friday night to block a demonstration of support to the national police.
It had the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“We have witnessed a great time last year.
My parents were crying for joy on the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse.”
Despite their capital victory, although thin, at the regional elections in December last, Catalan independentist parties had difficulty maintaining the ealan this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained until they were judged for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanician who films the demonstration of police support on his phone, judges that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one side as on the other.
“The tension only rises,” he regrets.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison in waiting for a judgment since last year, announced his intention to apply for European Parliament elections next year.
“This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the disengaged repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Beat Home by Car

Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins match 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's First Goal Assures Livingston's Victory
Recently upgraded, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox club coach.
Menga’s goal has made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt’s team to place himself in the second position in the ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard’s men are deprived of Premiership’s outside league victory this season, and must face Sunday the Hearts team, which leads 8 points.
But before, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she prolongs her invincible course in the division with six matches, and her chief coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, might argue to have not yet lost any encounter.
Livingston missed an opportunity faced with shocked opponents
Holt's team could have taken ahead long before marking, because their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but remained in front of the adversary goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team left the Rangers possessing the ball, knowing it could disrupt them through worked tactics.
This is where the decisive goal intervened.
The Rangers granted a free shot and the Livingston tried an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touch and registered a goal from the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced an impenetrable defense and the goal guard Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's stop.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's strike, while Lithgow succeeded in playing one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston's guardian repulsed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the arbitrator, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand fault.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing performance and results for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed the expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have not almost changed since they returned to the summit, but the merit is largely returned to Holt for having a team since his arrival motivated.
There are many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they did not meet their past talent.
They missed a last occasion and managed to drill the adversary only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's mitigated welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at improving the relationships between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the opening of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, mostly Kurdish, heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome it in his country.
The clivage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10.15 local time, near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a travelled road from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver stopped, the rescue arrived on the spot, but the man died at the spot of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, approximately 1.5 km from the accident that occurred on Saturday.
London’s police said officers are working hard to identify the individual and warn his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: 6 agents wounded in an assault
High-security men's prison official said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and it is still not under control.
Anti-riot specialists were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, agents were treated for slight face injuries.
A prison leadership spokesman said: “Specially trained staff have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the officials will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their prolonged penalties.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in the prison HM Long Lartin.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an aggression by a prisoner.
In October, last year, anti-rival agents were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Uragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden raws (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is what will probably happen at the beginning of next week. The Rosa hurricane is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains energy. This region could be affected by sudden raws.
The national weather service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, south and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with advertising rains as early as Monday evening.
The Phoenix-based national weather service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the border of Arizona.
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert including the central area of the Rockies and the Grand Bassin should record from 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be saving for regions affected by drought that are not exposed to the risks of sudden crude.
Although the risk of flood should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, a little more than 40% of Arizona knows at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category,” weather.com reports.
The Rosa hurricane begins its way on the coast, in the Lower California Peninsula.
Always powerful Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa has been located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flood.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona on Tuesday early in the morning, as a tropical depression, and will cross Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert and constitute the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal suffering raws and debris melting in dry areas, as well as ground slides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the charge of a murder attempt, after a 16-year-old boy was found stuck in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, his state is currently stable.
Avon and the Sommerset police said they arrested the four young people (17, 18 and 20 years old) at the night on the side of Radstock.
The agents launched a call for people likely to have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh was victim of Democrats’ evil and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the scandalous and merciless methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a Wheeling meeting in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been victim of evil and anger of Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself Thursday before the Congress, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexual assault several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifyed at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage.”
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he mentioned the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I fight on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were on the mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedure vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, according to the statement by a Republican party employee at CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to grow
Saturday, the authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of which were overthrown by huge waves that shot down on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at the fall of the night, taking many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
“When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, and people didn’t flee immediately, it cost them to live,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone; he trained cars, pieces of wood, houses, he carried everything with him,” Nugroho explained, noting that the tsunami had moved through the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing the trees, he added.
Almost 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and stores, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb left on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found stuck under the decays of buildings in ruins, he added, indicating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be more significant on the 300 km northern coast of Palu, a region called Donggala, the nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could be worse,” she added.
Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading the information a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived as long as the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building screaming freneticly to passing through the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water dropped on the coast, carrying with him buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity failure that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to bring cargo aircraft aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuated people always need great food and other basic needs.
The city's airport reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: The balance sheet of the victims of the tsunami is exacerbated, more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The members of Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived healthy and safe in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the courtyard of their offices, and on the way they discovered devastating scenes, Doseba explains.
“They told me that they saw many houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When the aid groups began to help the sinisters, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we still expect.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of missing people still hoped for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the waste.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman buried under the decays for two days, near the body of her mother.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mangagi added.
“As an old in the paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon told he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained without answers.
“I think they never received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtle $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an auto distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police office.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy explains in the statement.
As he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of silver for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
A 41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this surname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled her coming for “emotional reasons,” the creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current professional pseudo, this surname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Yes’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, recalling the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I passed from Kanye, who means “the only” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, of everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union trait and the majors.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican president elected Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he will never use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals from the law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco’s square to “never use military forces to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student allocations and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of education opportunities drive young people to join criminal gangs.
The US is expected to double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double its research funding in this sector, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made AI announcements, while an official AI strategy is missing in the United States.
At the same time, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funds for research in the field of AI would be a good beginning, because all other countries have a length ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next big discovery in AI,” Lee explains.
Doubling funds could double the chance that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the best ranked American Othello player, then he integrated the Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often need to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
“It’s not China that appropriates academic leaders, it’s companies,” says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he said.
The Chinese State Affairs Council unveiled its new-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academy partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year for AI research.
In parallel, U.S. legislation to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any measures for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia heard their voices during a referendum on the change of their country name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve an old dispute for several decades with Greece, which had blocked the request for Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, of which one of the provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slav population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced he would not vote at the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% stake required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you for membership with NATO and the EU under the conditions of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for joining organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, rescued from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for my country’s future, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, sufficient members of Parliament claimed that they follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds to Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 a.m.
But the participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that mobilized 66% of voters registered after the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, to open the voice to NATO and the European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
At parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from needed investments. Unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a vast majority will be favorable, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the share of 57%.
70% of participants intended to vote said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes are required plus a vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first strike to the pro-western government policy since its power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, takes a path through Brighton’s defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won 2-0 match on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, appeared to be the world's easiest action for the player.
The Argentine shooter received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He contourned a defender before driving out others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball in Sterling, on his left.
The first Englishman took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guardian Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has a few problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, team coach, told journalists.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he marked at that time.”
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to Skyblues during the Premier League match.
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few keys before taking Sterling to the second poll.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the disorders against the Rockies
Because the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no right to launch a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an eliminatory match for the Rockies, real legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western League division.
The Rockies took him 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they still seek to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game doesn’t have any challenge, we want to climb the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why would I not want to participate?”
The Nationals must still announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be training on Thursday and launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington Righthouse is at 18-7 with an average of deserved points of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals from 220-step and two-thirds this season.
Trump’s interventions in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation that Brett Kavanaugh had given his support for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever before. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group, Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they overwhelm to take power and control; that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats are in mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, evil and liars.”
He spoke of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which made it worth the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant to those who express their ideas.
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Party parliamentarians considered to be unwelcome, all that for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received an identical treatment because she raised herself against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironicly, these are topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the gathering of the Nottingham East Labour Friday said, “We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive.”
That’s exactly what were the General Assemblies of Friday night during my eight years as Parliamentary of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, this is not the case with many meetings today and the promise of more gentle and respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into account.
It has become obvious that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's power taking, and the colleagues I thought to share the same political vision began to expect from me to return my jacket and to take positions opposite my beliefs, whether regarding national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I followed an abusive social media draw, calling for the withdrawal, denouncing the policies from the center, saying that I should not be a party member.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I was addressed were of political nature.
I am admired to the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a breakdown of sexistic or racist speech every day, but do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party had to encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted by the motions of trust and changes to the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lower my eyes, not express my ideas so strong, and everything would be fine.
But that’s not what I do with politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom, and since then I wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could not be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are laborians or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is parliamentary for the Nottingham East district.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late trials may have missed the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match of Scotland’s rugby Championship in XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they were taken the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
“Until now, we have been tested, but we remain invincus, so I must consider myself happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “They were bravo to them, they were more efficient than us and managed to take advantage of the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish escape Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the figures.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty before, just in the middle of time. He marked and transformed a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose began the second half-time and Patrick Anderson’s trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
He followed a long wait due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a barrel. During the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the interim captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and again, Melrose tried his luck with a untransformated trial of Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team resumed and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard for tapping Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's moul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the trial, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry away for the fifth trial of the home team.
Still Game’s Star Stars in Restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in restoration. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis incarnates in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his long-standing stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that comes will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be prepared for after-Craiglang.
According to the official registers, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to engage in the "flowing environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines patrol in a boat armored in the La Paz Naval District.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: “The sea returns to us rightly.
Recovery is a duty.”
Throughout the entire blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to benefit Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is always well present, just like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
Bolivia is expecting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive outcome,” explains Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many of Bolivia will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce the Bolivian application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should be bound to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (which faces a controversial fight for reelection next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made Monday.
“We are so close to be able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favour of Chile, and that few things would change even in case of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Board has no authority to grant a Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the result of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been devised by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales' beautiful rhetoric happened to all the remaining Chilian goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
“Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales – which to date remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political shell.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to remove ourselves from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not defer from nuclear weapons until he will trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to relaunch a nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, current leader of North Korea.
Ri declares that it is "chimeric" to think that maintaining sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a statement that will end the Korean war will fold the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of previous significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness regarding the resignation of an arsenal that the country considers as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion parades reveal the latest head cover trends, perhaps available in your shops soon
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, do not look for any more.
Creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversize delicious hats during a PE19 parade that made honor to the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
All more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delightful pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was an excentric beige hat decorated with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the head of the models.
The other oversize accessories included jewelry-walled pastecas, a sorcerer hat and even an ananas. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had lips sewn and mentioned more Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another reminding a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you’re lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the "Bomba", the broad straw hat on board that the stars draw from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hardly portable hat that flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the bath suit model that weared it.
The burned orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia franges and a handful of white leather, was the masterpiece of the PE19 Riviera de Jacquemus parade at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags coming to shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be a demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent examination results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and in their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school program, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a trustworthy link with inhabitants of other countries.
If we look at the excellent results of the exams this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest rating, A.
The data collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS shows that 72% of students received the highest rating, A in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 British Employment Commission and Skills survey reveals that among the difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting candidates, 17 per cent are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers that require languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable competence.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 with 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those in emerging economies, children will benefit from better chances of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classic contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the perspective of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed for their success, no matter what the future reserves them.
It is obvious that today, in a global business environment, languages remain important for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scottish youth.
We need to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans watching LeBron James’s debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday in pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump starts tonight a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stages, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote for confirmation of the vacant position in the Supreme Court is delayed, Trump seeks to gather support for the coming mid-mandate elections and prevent Republicans from losing Congress control during the November vote.
What time will Trump’s meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 a.m. (east time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the question of the hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual aggression, which took place this week. Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote in the Senate should be delayed up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings primarily aims to help Republicans gain field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
“Congress control is an essential element of its program that the president will go to as many states as possible at the beginning of the charged election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, this evening meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw Pittsburgh media attention.”
Saturday, it will be the second visit in a month of Trump to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is on the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to resume him in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of the simple Sunday
After three simple, the Saturday afternoon forsoms could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The balancing movement is an invented sports concept of all pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this.
Where would they now find the race?
“They were driving six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a little bit of the wings,” said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage with four points in advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel like they have a bit of the wind and have all the reasons to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day long and might argue to have scored three in four points each.
Spieth has proved to be terribly effective from tea to green and gives an example.
The energetic cry of joy intensified as his game was moving forward. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry of those who tell you that he believes the U.S. team still in lice.
“We really need to remain determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup’s story testifies.
The strange but adorable European pair won four in four matches and has no right to mistake.
Not only “Moliwood” were the only ones to not realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between themselves and the crowd by deluding designates them as players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to enjoy a potential European victory as the sun goes down on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning furball hero, while he was teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine hits sent Spanish and Sweden into a hole they could never come out.
On Sunday, nobody is here to help you.
Furballs and forsoms are so fascinating to watch closely because of interactions between pairs, advice they give and those they don’t give, and how a strategy can switch into an eye climb.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has made considerable advances during the last day, but this forsome session also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 on the United States during Saturday’s furballs and forsomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the burden with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points until now.
Decided to retain the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference in immigration 3-1 in the morning forballs, faced with a disordoned American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the forsoms and won two victories, but failed to resolve the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must absolutely earn eight points over 12 on Sunday at the simple ones to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to earn four accompanied points, while Molinari and he, called "Molliwood" after a collapsing weekend, are only the second pair in the Ryder Cup history to earn four points in their first four matches.
After cracking Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat flat sewing the pair composed of the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who trailed during the two Saturday matches, shine a few times, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in foursomes and foursomes, and seven accompanied.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning forballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, winning 2-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament in the southwest of Paris, in a fresh but free time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have established the reference for Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the forballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the forsoms, these losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a single four-point gap, although Furyk’s team, who held the crown, had to make a match null to keep his trophy.
After being seconds for two days, however, they might not recover from a counter-attack Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be able to become unilaterally without confidence.
Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that remaining sanctions strengthened its distrust against the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea took “important goodwill measures” last year, such as terminating nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding answer from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will be afraid of our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While repeating North Korea's well-known reproach of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually takes measures, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of a unilateral denuclearization by the past as Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first summit between an U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to work for a "nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to dissolve severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insisted that North Korea should first denuclearization and increasing pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their objective in a coercive manner, even opposing "the declaration of war end".
“Those who think these sanctions can cause us to plunge don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comments on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such an impasse.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles to the North American territory after the “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” in suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year before the United Nations to “destroy totally” North Korea, did not praise this year on the courage with which Kim implemented disarmament measures, but added that it was still much to be done and that the sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea will disarm.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years, or five months; it’s no importance,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already traveled three times to North Korea, but his last trip was a little disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming progress had been made but, in the following hours, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to South Korean President, Kim claims Trump’s promised security guarantees in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relationships with Washington.
Harvard: Students Taking Rest Courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight the growing machist trend that consists of studying in consuming caffeine all night.
A teacher noticed that most students from the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first in the United States.
After having given a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning, the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and asked, "Why is it told me only in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Spent for the first time this year, this course explains the need for students to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Chief Executive Officer of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections shows the image of a bedroom containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep lack can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the culture of pride of “a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be “the secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of inanition, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and forced him to insist on it to be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all graduate students to follow a similar program before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide an alarm for both sleep and awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” issued by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal to drop Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new hard shot outside, Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's disengaged team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first victory on the road since his 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at drive, eight points behind the Hearts, Leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team, shortly inspired, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall in sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the goals difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, arbitrator Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury due to the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which scanned Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, however, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team suffocated his opponents at each round.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingston did it more.
They should have scored two minutes away, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his team co-defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second poll.
The Rangers managed to take control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos surely believed that he should have been penalty after the free coup when Steven Lawless and he collided, but arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian's requests.
The Rangers only benefited from two shootings in the first period, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If Livi's 34th-minute score opened against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in front of Jacobs' stopped foot.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted half-time by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange almost immediately impacted when the wing came before Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett balling long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow goes next to the goal.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game as he was fighting with Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored him.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our Almanach “Sunday Morning”: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the TOURN ACCOUNTER... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention which subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Pillar of science since then, the Geiger Counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man asked, "What's that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, we use it to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of the atoms released in minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, it’s sure it’s going to jump there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "discover" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose purpose is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, proved in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
With a MAGA headset, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatribe after moving to the SNL.
It didn't happen well
Kanye West bowed himself on the plateau after a dechained performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to attend the elections in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a headset Make America Great Again, West took it up to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I speak to whites and they say, 'How can you love Trump?' he's racist!"
“Well, if racism was worried, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which Hollywood's headline mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was reported on social media by actor Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock heard to mock West with this publication.
Furthermore, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the scenes because of his helmet.
“They pressured me.
They told me not to come with that helmet on my head.
They made pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a buffer," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the gouffle?" and stated that he would be wearing his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try love.”
His comments attracted shelters at least twice from the audience and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on site told the magazine: “A silence of death fell over the entire plate.”
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disappointed a lot of people singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative Group leader Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you to have it to the foul.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s animator, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward anyone (by purchasing his music, clothes, or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the traces of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg carryed the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince Fire, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fine blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantastic series.
But the 31-year-old actor took himself into the stereotype of the male hero, saying that this type of role on the screen often brings young boys to be made as hard to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he said “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Game of Thrones covette, confessed that he had "strongly" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think profoundly that we have undermined masculinity.”
"What teachings have we given to young men who become adults, with respect to the problem now?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What is TV and street teaching young boys who encourage them to think they have to behave in this way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental issues of our time – how can we change this?
There is obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not make any prologs or follow-ups when the series will end next summer, saying he had finished with “battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a resumption of True West by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now,” he says.
Rose performed Ygritte, Kit’s character-lover Jon Snow in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie’s family field.
HIV/AIDS: China reports new cases increased by 14 percent
China has indicated an increase of 14% in the number of inhabitants with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contaminated with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people with HIV and HIV in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious issue.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed data about senators, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these statements were supported by experts and “extreme-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and still infidel lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators, Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was released on Thursday by a stranger at Capitole Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual aggression against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifiing the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of such information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
The Waters statement quickly raised online reviews, including by Ari Fleischer, former White House press attached.
“This denial is of anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not possess the necessary temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
She must not challenge the reasons of the accuser.
She must stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters’ headquarters during the mid-mandat elections, also reported his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s enormous,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned “the authorities and services responsible for enforcement of the laws concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are discovered,” she added, “and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all of my team members.”
Johnny English struck again. Rowan Atkinson's parody, underdowed spy
It has now become a tradition of searching for Brexit’s scope in any new British movie and this seems to apply to this recovery of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new chance of exporting our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with escarched eyes and rubber face, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-Anglo-speaking film audience.
Of course, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his doubtful attempts of glamour charmer, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who runs a small note in The Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television ads Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The latest Johnny English has one or two friendly moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter as he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at the time when the “serious” licenses like 007 and Mission impossible compose themselves with confidence with the comedy.
Humour seems more child-oriented than adults and, for me, Johnny English’s colourless disappearances are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s mute film gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetual premise of news is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spyers, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field, with the great disastrousness of agents in service - unfortunately a low-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflowing for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and already suffers from political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is nothing to put herself under the tooth in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisors report that each active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of her retirement.
This means that you must disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic school school as a master, but who secretly gives lessons about how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farces here, as English offers a Rock Academy academy of spy mode.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and finds Bough, his former long-sleeved partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create big trouble with His Majesty’s secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the charismatic technological billionaire who is said to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of colourful jokes: under the dress of servers, they put fire in a brilliant French restaurant; they create a chaos on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a real anarchy when trying, with a helmet of virtual reality, to familiarize with the interior of Volta.
All the stops are guaranteed for this last sequence, but despite all, there is not a lot of things for children in all that.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn’t stop thinking, like the other Johnny English movies: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will actually value his talent?
The Labour Party has denied developing a plan for British to be able to work for four days but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to hit the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The passage to a four-day week was approved by the union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes together with the party’s approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers and its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Chancellor-deputy John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour Conference to give details on his vision of a socialist economy revolution.
Mr. McDonnell is committed to resuming power in the hands of “anonymous administrators” and “profit” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies cannot recover all of their payment as the Labour government could operate "deductions" due to alleged driving gaps.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, which will bring up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week following the FBI’s investigation on the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was resolved, determined, and unmistakably.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in the stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would be necessary to have an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t check it.
It's a 36-year-old affair.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive palmware of stars and invested with an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people run to Central Park’s Great Lawn in order not only to enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the population of the festival’s real goal, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, telephoneing, or doing any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population in the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal within the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people through a free concert really allow them to persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of “cliptivism” – situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters, who complain for many different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have helped encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, including a range of at least $10 billion has already been paid or withdrawn.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main commitments includes The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed to “help children to develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda to help 35 million pounds to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” told the crowd Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition program at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions to call for the UK to improve mothers and children’s nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said, “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great movements to defend civic rights and fight apartheid before us, we will achieve it, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will live the show.
U.S. could appeal to the Navy to create a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Secretary, cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
“The United States, with our Navy, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not marketed,” he added.
Zinke was addressing participants at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “energy consumer spokesman” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, emphasizing that they are actually identical.
“As for Iran and Russia, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia, saying that Iran has “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at the time the Trump administration committed to dynamizing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the “improper” project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry, Russian energy minister Alexandre Novak said: “I think we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position raised negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the United States to not engage in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren would seriously consider the possibility of attending the 2020 presidential elections, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections following the mid-mandate elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was planning to present.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that a woman will have to be at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider to submit my candidate for presidential parties.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump during the public gathering, saying he was “leading that country in the wrong direction.”
“I am really concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been honest in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not aware that it is expected to take place in 2020.
According to the survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Centre, 58% of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters claimed that the senator should not be present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% in favour of this campaign.
Other names of Democrats highly in view for a potential campaign in 2020 include those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks of Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enrollment in September.
He was arrested and accused on Monday evening as part of an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son currently feels, what he feels when he returns, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries our soldiers return with,” she told the public at the gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a “tabu subject” and said about his son and other former fighters that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering whether they are respected what their companions and members of the air forces, and each other military, has given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of a woman’s aggression and domestic violence, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the state of drunkness.
18 States and Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute in the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute of the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memory in favour of an asylum seeker who disputed this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had attacked her, but the U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
The new U.S. policy on asylum has cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeal Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Columbia District Attorney General, said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in his memory.
Lawyers also supported in memory that the policy of refusal to enter immigrants hurts the US economy, supporting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “providing the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in his announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate all problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while double the number of dead in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her fevery boy in Palu, in a center of evacuation from the village.
“Every moment an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed houses, picking up wasted goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake have been submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told him how he had felt the violent earthquake that shake the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have the time to save ourselves.
I have been crushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told Associated Press, noting that his family was in town for a marriage.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to her or to my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “intimidation” by means of “propaganda advertising”
A week after a four-page Chinese newspaper boasts the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in a US newspaper, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned on Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to be in the U.S. parliamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China refuses.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to engage in the U.S. elections, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington-led campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that led them to apply reciprocal rates to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a paper of opinion published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling his intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few contestant voices and won’t see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the troubling Chinese economic trajectory, because the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans bring electronics to approach mid-mandat elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many senior Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual aggression, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vibrant, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, stated that “one cannot go back.”
Reeher added he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favor of an FBI investigation are sufficient to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang “November arrives!” in the Senate corridor while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be dismayed,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But this could be even higher, especially among electorals in the outskirts and among young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the nominated Supreme Court, analysts let them believe that the reaction would risk to be alive if the Republicans made the confirmation forward.
According to NBC News, former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week, “It became a confused disorder for the GOP.”
“This is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh, but also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that assists the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of the two sides, a small majority looking on the side of Ford.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of people consulted believed absolutely or probably at Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably at Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations advanced by Ford and at least one other accusator, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressures of Senator Flake.
Ford testifyed under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh as he was in drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the free Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview awarded to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt aims to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do so now,” he said about the launch.
“This is a historical moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it entirely belongs to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
As of this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in discussion with “Facebook and Google” in order to know whether or not a complete change should be made where all their business models are completely shampooded in a moment.
“We do not ask them for permission.”
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “the mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the aim of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an ecclesiastical of the First World War decorated by the Victoria Cross
The only church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by an elite shooter four days later and knew he had won the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said he was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploitation.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann directed his bataillon on the Saint-Quentin channel "through a very thick fog and under the violent shot of campaign and machine guns."
Later, he rushed on the shooting line and, with the “greatest bravery,” guided the line before pushing a campaign canon to himself and stumbling three soldiers from the detachement.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band’s parade.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you’ve spent all night watching a well filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event was 13 fights, six of which on the main sheet, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, UK viewers were sided when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied that they remained awake until the first hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to the cartoon for children as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, the chief vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation provides that at 6 o’clock in the morning, this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children’s emissions.”
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think of rediffusion, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning a Sunday and we can’t find any solution before Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there was a lot of messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We tried to repair, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that this won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more to fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up by feeling lower than others because of his sexuality - but that has insufled him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everybody was like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presentator Kirsty Young took a monthly leave due to her illness.
As a shipwreck in Laverne’s first show, Daley believed that he felt “less” than all other children growing up because “it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being lower and different are the true things that gave me the power and strength necessary for my success.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The Olympic Bronze Double Medal is now a renowned LGBT activist and has benefited from its participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask a larger number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without branches and he wanted to give back “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he “doesn’t wait” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the difference in age had never been a problem.
“When we saw so many things at such a young age,” he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of a cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that “his whole perspective had changed.”
“If you asked me last year, I just thought to win a golden medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 as a result of brain cancer.
Daley believed that his father had not agreed to die and that one of the last things he had asked him was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there anymore to be in the first row,’ he said.
“I took him by hand when he ceased to breathe and it was necessary to cease to breathe and be dead so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“That was all I dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, this inspired him his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - who had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
An off-shaped Mickelson on the bank of the Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get up to prevent it from being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was deleted by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the fifty-fold big champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the skinfining of his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the biggest leader, even at the top of his career. At the age of 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough punishes systematically the lost shots.
And as if the course wasn’t frightening enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday match, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 single matches, take a good start, Mickelson’s match might be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a stick in the back, put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a great trust in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two matches.
I planned more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demises, although Furyk claimed that his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he said.
“I think younger players were happy to measure themselves this week, which was fun to see.
It’s doing much more than playing.”
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that an unimportant advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danish played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros counted five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually climbed to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, carrying it 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we were broadly leading to Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won but fairly,” Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 ranking winning 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go down tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, i.e. trying to win this trophy, and that is what we need to remain focused on.
I’ve always said I focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added, “I would never move forward to this point.
Tomorrow, it's a very different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow are the individual performances that will be presented and it’s going differently.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re there in a lonely, you’re being tested at the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to send the players to get the best of themselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind him, he must go to get the best of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three in four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of the last day’s turns, after becoming part of the Brookline winning team before losing after the “Miracle of Medinah”, where Europe took away the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, weighs a lot of pressure on the games of the middle.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to do, we were trying to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
“I’ve accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire path,” Bjorn said on his simple selections.
Germany’s new warship is still delayed
According to local media, the new fregate of the German Navy should have been launched in 2014 to replace ageing warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the implementation of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the amiral ship of all new Baden-Württemberg fregates, was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the concerning problems that occurred after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class aging fregates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful canon, a range of anti-air and anti-virus missiles, as well as some stealing technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fregates for up to two years outside the attachment ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, incessant delays mean that the avant-garde ships of war - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the big titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipwork in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a naval manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship unnecessary in case of deployment in a fighting mission.
Software defects were particularly important because Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by an crew consisting of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the Bremen class's old fregate crew.
Furthermore, it seems that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
Beyond computer system failures, the project price as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to $2.2 billion at the start.
The issues related to new fregats are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts that Germany's naval force decreases.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s Defence Commission, recognized earlier this year that the Navy is actually “on ships able to deploy.”
The manager said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were dismissed but no substitute ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Surveys the Secret Life of Mushrooms
New research conducted in a field of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how the moths use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will throw a new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common pipettes and sopranos, as well as brown long-ear sharks and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the butterflies throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
Professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of the crysms and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of the habitat for mushrooms and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grassroots and the best way to preserve forests for sausages and other related species.
In Scotland and the UK, the populations of chauves have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect perchoirs and lead to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, just like mouth kill papers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks from cats.
The butterflies are not really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the mushrooms very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections at the perchoir and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland’s butterflies at the site of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scotland’s butterflies.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have a perfect place for mother-in-laws,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about cows, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what cows need to prosper.”
It emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of mushrooms before maintaining properties, because by destroying without a single nest of maternity, 400 females and little women can thus be dead, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
Mushrooms are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perchoirs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our mushrooms and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what happens in their populations for now.”
Ronaldo refuses accusations of rape while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape against him as “false information,” and said that people “want to get acquainted” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and the Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375,000 to keep silence on this incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
While talking to his 142 million fans in a live video published on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, 33, called this information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the fifty-fold Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to get a pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have called “inadmissible denunciation of suspicion in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would apply for a repair for “moral damage amount proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were apparently returned to the player’s room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed at the court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him to be a “good guy” at “99 percent,” but he didn’t know what was happening with the remaining “1%”.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that he went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she had later accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "repressed by reprisals" and feared "suffering public humiliation."
This 34-year-old woman says she now seeks to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automobile manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, Commerce Secretary of State, the UK “ would regret it forever” if it had lost its status as a world leader in car construction after the Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory, near Derby, if Britain retired from the EU without an agreement.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border delays on the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says she will close her Mini factory in Oxford for a month following the Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify as a risk for the supply chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “stretched flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and EU for vehicles manufactured on custom.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on March 29, there could be border disruptions that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory over a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that, as I said, will not only take advantage of the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has been an excellent set of supply chains.”
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, co-ordinator of the Unite union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said his members were increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once these jobs disappear, they will never return.”
A government spokesman said, “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationships with the EU.”
White House announces Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and deputy prosecutor general Rod Rosenstein could be “repelled for a week,” while the struggle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special advisor in charge of investigating Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump’s employees and Russia, and the possible impediments to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General or not, and therefore puts Mueller's independence into danger, feeds rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
Last Monday, however, he presented himself at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not prefer to return Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh testified and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week’s investigation on complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the Senate’s vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attached Sarah Sanders appeared at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, “No date has been set for this, it might be this week, I could see if we’re still going back for a week given all the other things happening to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press aware of it.”
The assertion would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conferences at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the lectures was not due to an aversion to television reporters, although she said, “I have nothing against the fact that they amaze the gallery.”
Then she said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the figures.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to question directly the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do this frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take place a press conference where you’ll be able to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
There are rare press conferences on a solo basis.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, making a relaxed appearance and sometimes a strange appearance before the gathered journalists.
About Brexit Fears, Secretary of Health writes to EU Workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish to stay in post after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of an absence of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I estimate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee Tigers secondary, was urgently operated after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
“He came to the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the keyline before placing it on a barbecue and taking it on another exam.
A state representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was leaving the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was “no details yet about the type or extent of the injury” and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete student, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five flags on Saturday before leaving the match, which took his total season to 18 flags.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will need to pay higher stamp duties if they purchase property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless people in the framework of new conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign led by Corbyn to attract young voters
Increase in stamp rights will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will serve to help homeless people, Theresa May announces today.
This measure will be perceived as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters by committing to provide more affordable housing and target people winning high income.
The increase in stamp right will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to strengthen government efforts in struggle to help homeless people.
This tax - which is added to the current stamp law, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new London constructions are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and prevents prime-accessors from making a place in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “the ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who stay mostly outside the country.
This new policy occurs just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp right to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of maintaining real estate prices at a high level by securing lands without using them, he invited Ms. May to renounce affordable housing quotas with the aim of resolving the “property disgrace” that lives in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including rent control and suppression of “freely” expulsions.
He also wishes to give advice to the wider powers to build new housing.
May said, “Last year, I said that I would devote my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that each next generation would have a better life.
To do this, we have to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become away and the misery of homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland’s technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become Scottish selector at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is happy to face the challenge of re-born the Northeast club, which currently occupies the third place in Ligue 1, at three points of the leader.
He ran the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s games in Hampden with my father and it’s one thing I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would, however, only appear if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross predecessors as Sunderland selectors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic’s former technician states he did not hesitate to hold behind such iconic names in such a big club, already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question “can I bring this club back to the Premier League?”
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is without a doubt belonging to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to do it, but I would probably consider myself as a success here only if I’m able to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months within Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa rise from a relegation to a third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, as a great winner of the championship the next season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “probably was a true crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought it was better for me to be a coach than play.
It seems strange because I went out well, I gained my life well, and I enjoyed some appreciable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are plenty of details to be adjusted every week.
I keep living this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being coach is very well for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my whole adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a paint is 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer cannicule raised the income of British pubs in difficulty, but exacerbated the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bars and pubs groups recorded a 2.7% increase in their sales in July, but restaurant revenues dropped by 4.8.
CGA’s advisor Peter Martin, who compiled the data, said: “The permanent sunshine and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup made that July followed the model of June, where bars had experienced an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The decline of 1.8% in the food sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcohol drinks are served are far more in vogue, with more points of resemblance than restaurants dropping down.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get out of a drink.
In pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, a RSM recreational and hotel analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors in sales on the off-home market.
No surprise that restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales by 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuous cost pressure.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have been less timely for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we’ve known in August will give a well-deserved rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the installation.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK’s Peach Tracker Coffer for pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds Sterling and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five child has secret accounts he hides from his parents.
According to a survey, one in five child – some of whom are only 11 years old – has secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey conducted with 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has stressed concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five child – some of whom are only 11 years old – opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey conducted with 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "false Insta accounts" - a reference to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has stressed concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they manage a “main” account cleaned to show it to their parents while having a private account.
A mother who fell by chance on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, half of students recognized to have private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said, “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers do not find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes in the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the director body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the past ten years.
“Eilidh has a huge respect within the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m very hoping to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters trials in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transitional ishemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would say if I would recover or how much.
It was an exciting job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for encouraging messages!”
Online, an advertising on the milk drawer that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising from a company offering a pull-off compares breastfeeding mothers with cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called “first silent milk driver in the world,” Elvie, a large-scale technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom her new milk driver offers to breastfeeding women.
In a cow farm filled with houn, four true mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: “Yes, I bring myself, but you don’t see how tail” and “If you didn’t notice it, they are my breasts, not breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women carrying milk.”
However, advertising, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it is lighting on the dairy industry’s “horrors”.
“A little decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days after their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pull for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added, “A so disconnected advertising.”
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman admitting that she found the "hilating" song.
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, "It's a fun advertising for mothers who take milk (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like "cows."
It’s not an advertising that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal having danced with the discreet pulling milk hidden in their cage.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk drawer say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie milk pull is completely silent, without wires or pipes and is discreetly inserted in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new pulling-milk will gain.
It's not the first time Elvie's pulling milk makes one of the newspapers.

Hundreds of children of migrants moved silently in a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border passages remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration’s severe speeches and policies have made it possible to complicate children’s investments in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves paperless immigrants and they were afraid of compromising their own opportunity to stay in the country by taking on the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testifyed last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of non-accompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no judicial antecedents.
“Nearly 80% of respondents or family members are here illegal, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have established new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard before.
Many of them will compare by video conference rather than in person to proceed with their legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Persons considered inadmissible will be quickly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the longer they are likely to become anxious or depressive, which can lead to bursts of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble to handle.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on the Syrian ground illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without condition,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem said the “war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been deraged from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "lead this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged" from both terrorist groups and any "illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which form and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this country devastated by the war, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said the conditions were favorable to their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that dissuaded refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are easily facilitated,” he said.
“They are politizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have stated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has made political negotiations progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for “specific deadlines” and issued hope that military measures will target jihadists, especially fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who will “be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee gathering members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the path for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, claiming that the group’s work should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and formulated a warning against any intervention.
Why Trump Wins Second Mandate
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, destitution and scandal lead him to leaving his presidency early.
What would probably be “the most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the audience does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, cutting hours scores have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show”, which reachs 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
“This is a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, the dramatic series presenter of the ABC Designated Survivor, speaking of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comic writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a few irrefutable truths about sliding into the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
She remembers took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked her.
"He answered, 'Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a fun value.
Obviously, unlike whatever happens on television, Washington scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnect is a luxury that only the most fortune viewers can afford.
And however, it exceeds being an informed citizen when a panel of experts is to be watching for six hours to debate how Bob Woodward used a “deep know-how” for his book “Fear” on the clothes of truce leather at $15,000 from Paul Manafort, which was the extract of the storms.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“If a part of what he does feels like seeing a reality TV show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director-general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, about Trump’s changed teams and daily situation reverses.
We can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise we're on the track.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he terrated inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not discontinue, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to confront the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time we animated all these crazy emissions and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest elections in the middle of mandate
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the Congress districts that allowed two holders to dispute the same seat.
This district of the Pittsburgh suburb, which has recently been restructured, is the headquarters of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his headquarters in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is taken to another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who strongly overheads the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th District has brought out a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of parties' financing, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory winning in March at a very popular special election in the 18th Pennsylvania Congress district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district victory by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The U.S. planned to penalize the Salvador for its support for China and then dropped back.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a Panama hotel until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to summon U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions have only been scheduled against Salvador, who received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, particularly to control drugs and provide developmental and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
While the internal meetings were continuing, North America and Central America representatives delayed a high-level conference with the theme of security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting that took place last year, perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting an end to any consideration in terms of sanctions against the Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now hears to speak at the mid-October conference to show the importance of the administration to the meeting, the diplomats have reported.
And the three US issuers were quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the coverage of anonymity.
Their words were confirmed by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next tile could be special lawyer Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstacle to justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation towards the question of consciousness of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of the Congress changes his hand, Mr. Trump will be in the obligation to make accounts before the body, when he is preparing to represent himself before the voters and, perhaps, a jury composed of his peers.
These are many "yes", and I do not claim that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will influence the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and repelled the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history turns around these climbings and the inevitable walk of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these climbings.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein is in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to secretly record the president and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recent investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual aggression and unhonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-mandat elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump for accounts?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who previously occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table treating the swastika.
With this heritage as heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against Austrians, as a result of the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived Graham Dorrans from his first participation in the season until the zero match 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to get the best of such a result to make exploits.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old attacker.
“We entered the game by thinking of getting something and we left with a point.
We might have won it at the end, but overall, a zero match was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half-time and we came back in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday, this is another important European party.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but this will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can go forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph.”
Women no longer find sleep because of fear about their retirement savings
Even though the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to take care of them, few people talked about the issue with their family members.
Almost half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they have spoken to their children.
“People wish a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what they need to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes to them in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can get care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost of care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a purchase-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles throughout.
Plan a health care procurement that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a procurement concerning your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your invoices if you are incapacity.
Think of the small details: Assume that your elderly parent has medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“There are not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?

A man has been wounded repeatedly with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets shot with a compressed air gun as he came back on foot from a party.
The victim, about 40 years old, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in her chest, belly and hand.
Police have described the incident, which took place around 2:30 p.m. BST, as a “random act.”
The victim has not seen his assault.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police launched a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance sheet is expected to rise.
Because the communications were paralyzed, the emergency services could not receive any information from the regent of Donggala, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the top of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regent that is far more than 300 km (180 miles) from the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regence, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the central Sulawesi province, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami repeatedly for a century, according to the Indonesian disaster reduction agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit west of Donggala in 1996, making nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, occurring on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that deferred over 14 countries, causing 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shaken the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake reached southern Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that touched the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of a magnitude of 7.6 shake the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-sized earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shocked Pidie Jaya’s regentment in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and the 2004 murderous tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes shake the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed several thousands of constructions and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's elder son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the elder son of the former Alaska governor and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspects of domestic violence, contrary to a report of domestic violence and resistant to arrest, according to a statement released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone of a female gender knowledge that was trying to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in preliminary detention in Mat-Su's preliminary detention centre and is held under $500 unwarranted cash, KTUU said.
He came before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, it’s sure” when his petition was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to one year and is paid to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor class B offence, sanctioned for one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges are made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is underway before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His companion claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after making the link between her son’s violent behavior and the PTSD derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are undergoing failure and the victim's balance sheet is expected to expand in the coming days.
The earthquake declared just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami dropped on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors demand death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York attacker who made eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov would have used a truck rented at Home Depot to attack a cycling track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, running on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily damage, according to the statement of intention to apply for the death sentence deposited from the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to lead to the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for money extortion, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack needed “a careful preparation and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov as “odiosis, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini’s families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” said in a statement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty for ten years.
The accused Khalid Barnes was declared guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was later sentenced to a life-long prison sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR over the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, has demonstrated an absence of regrets in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial cases.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with his acts.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been incited to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, police said.
He claimed not guilty to the 22 chiefs of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” of the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to apply death penalty rather than to accept his blame and condemn him to life-to-life prison without possibility of liberation can only extend the trauma related to these events for all interested parties,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Parliament says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" at a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's members suggested, he should be charged with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Back-Ban MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would have already been released if Farage had been a Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that May faces to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been emphasized by the Conservatives in favor of the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty maintaining its Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to go out and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
Allies emphasized that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force euroscepticians and Labours to choose between her programme and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the gathering of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "rid of Chequers."
He believed that Mr. Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted to the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already gone out,” he said.
Wellingborough’s member added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU, and continued: “We have not been handed over to world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that the public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also present on the walk to tell journalists, “I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case with our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Get away from Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honor their promises.
“Mr. Farage told the gathering that politicians should be forced to “feel pressure” if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive Brexit and we tell them today, “We will not let you get out of it like this.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists have launched banners of conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because of the security issues regarding the party’s application at the beginning of the conference.
“They are those who ensure us that they are able to implement computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself in presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future on Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice against President Donald Trump, presents for the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the states, who was co-chairman in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of the speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump was taking office.
One participant asked her whether she intended to present herself to the Presidency.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman head of the state.
Arrest in the death by ball of Sims at Louisiana State University
Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by basketballer Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department took part in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 AM.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man on the pictures.
Sims, 20, was killed by bullet Friday morning, near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a head bullet injury and killed his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of her friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to have found himself on the spot, possessing a weapon, and shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police office of the Eastern parish Baton Rouge.
Sims, a 2 m-year-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, including 10 as starting last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads towards world title after the team’s guidelines allowed him to win victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broken Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to launch the torment at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a round later and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver leaving the inner part counter-heartedly at the risk of standing after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years old.
He then dominated much of the race while keeping his tires to target a speed arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th round, but was not able to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, Raikkonen ranking itself fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed she had not unveiled the letter of Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s judicial committee, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were “evil, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that might happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the disclosure and the flights, they say, ‘Oh, I did not.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose any information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a moment.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the Senator’s impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in detail, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me.”
But his denial doesn’t seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the gathering: “I’m going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Perhaps she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual aggression by three women, the president said Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
“You see evilness, miscarriage, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to obtain power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars deleted their Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie returned the equality home before Dwyer returned the advantage to Giants.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen registered two goals, assuring them the victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being trapped.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumph in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage of the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a Kendall McFaull pass, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During the first well-loaded period, Sullivan launched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt began at Cownie's service at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer insured the Giants advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening to the end of the first period.
The local team gathered together and Bouchard once again equalised with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in head for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory to his team by marking a fifth goal in the middle of the course.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will host Milton Keynes at their next match Friday.
An air traffic controller died by helping hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane carriing hundreds of people can safely depart.
More than 800 people died and many others were wearing missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to devastate the region and a large number of people are trapped under decays in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely decline.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt she collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to carry it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrives in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet would continue to grow up because many bodies were still under the decays and a large number couldn’t be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu that will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross short to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the military of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks relating to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that made more than 550 deaths.
Air Niugini says a man disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members evacuated safely the flowing aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to more accurate information requests regarding the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water by trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact development of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the aircraft's emergency outlet flowing.
he claimed that board officers had panicked and screamed, and he suffered from minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby in improving a quai had also participated in rescue using a pneumatic boat to carry people on farm land before the plane flows in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The accusation postponed his case Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telephone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis e was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data demonstrated that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to meet with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went talking to Sanford.
Sanford appeared to the bar on Saturday and witnessed that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had said the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he “[lied] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He has erased him from his life,” Hale said.
The defence must start its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to stand in front of the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating his music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York girlfriend pursues a couple for dismissal after a “racist” text
A New York girlfriend pursues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misleading message by the mother who complained that it was “an still black”.
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimiles the prosecution to an “extorsion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her consternation in 2016 by noting that Giselle Maurice, the new girl, was Black at her arrival for her first working day.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood her careful, “uncomfortable,” Plasco-Flaxman returned Ms. Maurice, explaining that her former girlfriend, who was African-American, had done a bad job and she was rather waiting for a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day of work and then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Mauritius pursues the couple in court to obtain a compensation for their remittance and claims a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do such things,” she explained at the Post Friday, adding, “I know that it’s discrimination.”
The couple replied to the allegations of racism saying it was reasonable to end Mauritius' employment, fearing not to trust him after he wronged him.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the post.
“But would you entrust your kids to a person you were unpleasant with, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assuming the trial with an “extorsion,” Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do,” the business bank added.
While the case is still ongoing, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blame them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, unveiling a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: “It’s hard to get in place of someone who reads it for the first time before her publication.
It’s very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a little pelux bear, would remain optimistic in the face of the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-amer flavor" after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man, and he wasn’t a pretentious,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds: we’re proud of him, even though it’s not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Although this is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by the phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to come out of it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly exhausting and getting out of his system.
She was dead some time ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that everything was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep the shot.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in grief of her daughter, climbed on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the trial she passed through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced that immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Mourning women place postcards to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide strive to prevent others from killing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed on a Wales bridge postal cards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I’m forced to feel everyday,” she said.
Ms. Davis, a 45-year-old and staying in Lydney, said her son was a promising chief with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he left his job before he died, since he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler, then 11-year-old brother, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid there’s an exercise effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to and whom you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep silence – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Ms. Davis, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt shot, depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his change in attitude.
It was at his lowest on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything.
She indicated that her death had represented a huge trauma for them, but they have to get out of it: "It's crushing for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future was put into play as the FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in his scope - we could possibly bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "fall down" in a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-mandat elections will only take place in five weeks, or November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush reached the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and, through him, met his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
We still don't know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to separate the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters "fall" under Kim's Leadership
The number of North Korean desertors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un’s power ascension seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs claimed by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
The vast majority of Northern Deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee by China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea.
China considers desertors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often refugees.
The relationships between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of focused interviews on the denuclearization negotiations that have remained until then.
This happened after the historic meeting of June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the large lines, to work in favour of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho attributed to US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysteric", and claims he is unable to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of parliamentary minority, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview granted Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t stop thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have dealt with her as “hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee of the Magistrature last Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied, with emotion, allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very emotional and sometimes almost shouted and suffocated by evoking his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats sitting in the committee, calling allegations about him as "grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he took Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesited when asked if she was trying to remove Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats obtained majority from the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only incapable of sitting in the Supreme Court but also incapable of sitting in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned with Kavanaugh's eventual decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his hearing confirmation of the charges, Mr. Kavanaugh addressed the issue of the possible overthrow of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s not wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflowing, and she cannot get her out without crying.
“We’re crying when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you?”
“I was dramatically helped by a woman who was frame somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person to whom she spoke, when she was angry and crying: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as exuting to anger, in part because they are fundamentally incomprehensive.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a office dominated by men, where I found myself crying of an unexpressible rage, was to have been seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always a little terrified - who driven me into a staircase.
"Do not let them see you cry in any way," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you sad and are happy because they had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Colorado Democratic Deputy, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart was taken into an extraconjugal affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself to present herself to the presidency.
“It was not a maturely thoughtful decision,” she told me laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other lice candidates, and the last thing they missed was another person.
Someone had called this "Snow White and the Seven Nails."
Because the campaign was very advanced, she had delayed in fundraising, and thus swore she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually give $1,000 to men would only give him $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so disturbed by her emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration to the system that made the collection of funds so difficult and targeting voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that it felt out.
“You thought I was doing a nervous depression,” Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
“You thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember was wondering what they were going to put on my felt stone.
“She cryed?”
How Trade War between the United States and China Could Benefit in Beijing
The first salves of the trade war between the United States and China have been depressing, and although the battle is far from completion, a disagreement between countries could benefit in Beijing over the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion sterling pounds), thus taxing half of all goods from China coming to the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in nature, recently hitting customs duties of 5% to 10% in $60 billion of US goods.
China has committed to equal the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will go soon.
Returning to Washington is to give up to the demands, but to give up publicly before the United States would be too embarrassing for China’s president Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, US trade war pressures could have a positive long-term effect on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic slowdown in either of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have recognized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security thinking group.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria declares ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests help to reconstruct this devastated country by a war that has last for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on site is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues the rehabilitation of the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome support to the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European ground and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team crossed the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during the majority of the tournament, dropped his start in water at the 16th hole in-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition dating back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was dismissed from 5 to 4 by the least well placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 in front of the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European Champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I’m not crying, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to recover the cut.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help it,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the flag to his compatriota John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost his four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has had trouble all weekends finding the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing benefit about his team: “I am proud of these guys, they have struggled.
This morning we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We abandoned.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to climb.
We have gone beyond ourselves.”
Point info on red tide: Low concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in concentrations of red tide in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County - which fears decreasing concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastlines, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Islands are located about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in less sites than last week.
Red tide was also observed in the county of Pasco.
