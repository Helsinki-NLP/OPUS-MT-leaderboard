Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection in a large vegetable farm in low Bavarian mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the prohibition of exhibition.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were positively tested on the corona coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 during the row investigation, as reported by the Land Board of Directors Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday night.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company – this was the occasion of the series test.
The operation is a large vegetable farm that cultivates strawberries, cucumbers, coal and red bets - but the cucumbers only for insertion glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with approximately 3,300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep peace: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people."
Infected in the court were separated from non-infected employees, the ground is now surrounded by an lockdown.
Green and SPD gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition fractions called on Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
“This can be bitter vengeance if such local infection occurrences have to be exploded and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
“We have already requested a special control program after the corona break in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof mid May, also for farms with harvesters,” said the environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“Just the hygiene conditions on the workplace and the living conditions have to be closely controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came "with an announcement".

Report: Seehofer urges longer storage data
The storage data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for a media report to extend the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for a prolonged storage of data, instead of the ten weeks planned for a half year, according to a media report.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change to the law.
Seehofer will therefore strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes that it is useful to “make urgently necessary adjustments in the law already now,” the newspaper quotes from the writing.
Currently, the storage of data is suspended.
It is expected to make a decision by the Court of Justice.
Seehofer wants the changes to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be considered meaningfully whether it needs legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, had already pronounced a storage of data in June.
NBA: Stripclub trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional at Los Angeles Clippers, is supposed to have left the Disney World tournament quarter in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he went to the Strip Club "Magic City" in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is again in isloation, is tested daily on COVID-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA Insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.

Söder speaks to the Corona Lage after mass infection
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be watched live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest helpers from several countries are currently working, over one-third has been infected with the corona painkiller.
The courtyard is now under quarantine and is shut down with a frame.
No one can leave the site, food will be delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to more than 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the Land Board so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the courtyard.
"Knowledge Bisses": Confession of the alleged fire-stifter of Nantes
"My customer has been cooperative," Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He very regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "pleased by conscience bites and taken very much with the extent of destruction."
In the case of a conviction, he threatens ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged on Saturday night last week with a fire.
The fire was broken out at three places far away from each other in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of firefoundation.
The suspect now detained was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released again after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the evening of the fire.
Since there was no trace for a violent penetration into the church, he quickly came into the sight of the investigator.
Discuss Abolition of the 50+1 Rules
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” said Grindel.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
Therefore, we don’t come around the debate, whether it’s not necessary to unites who want to enter these phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors.”
But he has doubts whether there is the willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations in the Bundesliga, which are prohibited by the 50+1 rules.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment centers to the Bundesliga economic location in the European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even a equal distribution of TV cash will not achieve a decisive effect.
“The FC Bayern makes sales of €750 million, Borussia Dortmund of €500 million and RB Leipzig of €300 million.
Therefore, the differences are immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Sorry, there have been people who noticed this mistake and broke through the press instead of talking to me about it,” Grindel said about the acceptance of an expensive watch, which led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has already been very humanly occupied."
The gift worth approximately 11,000 euros was received from an Ukrainian official.
"I've committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
“With the ominous watch gift, I dealt completely transparent and lightly.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB."
He never “made a collar of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
"It may be called naive, in any case, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new claims could not be met, the Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," he said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to renounce some of their claims of about $66 billion (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state pleasure.
It would be the ninth failure of payment in Argentina’s history.
Lastly, the lenders had requested higher interest rates on state bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine government, however, holds its last offer and is ready to no further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last was more than 50 percent.
Experts expect a decline in economic power by about 10 percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims of $503 million, and therefore was a limited failure of payment.
Arriving professionally - private yet not
"It's going super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, it was quick: in the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take on Lutz Feller’s succession in the Eggenfelden Notariat Agency.
Six weeks later, early July, the promoted lawyer started work, the normal day business has long been running on full tours.
"However, I have to reach private," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler and laughs.
Of course, the short runtime had not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingol finger.
Currently, with her husband working as a judge at the country court in Regensburg, she is looking for an appropriate apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has still been able to apply for parental time on a short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to walk from Regensburg every day, she also has a nightclub with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Grown up in the neighboring district, it is of course the city of Eggenfelden a term for a long time.
When visiting on site with her family in the past few months, she said: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
The more excited she was that she made the race in the selection procedure for the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional workshop, her homework plays a central role in Lower Bavaria: after the Jura study in Passau, she performed her referendum period and the Second State Exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarian, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at that time she also trained "nearby" the labour law - she took her first position as a notarian in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went in parental age, eventually followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representative services in various notary agencies.
When the job in Eggenfelden was signed for Lutz Feller’s close retirement, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has just given a praise to the team of the office: "It's super good!"
It makes it easier to take care of the upcoming movement of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten-respective cribs, it has already been in contact with a local facility.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to go after her hobby soon even here - and to meet the most beautiful jogging paths in the Rot Valley.
BVB plans to launch liga with a maximum of 15.000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20% in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance scheme, which is mandatory to comply with, we are planning with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers at the current level,” said Borussia Dortmund’s CEO Carsten Cramer to the “Dayspiegel”.
Usually, the arena in the district town at Bundesliga games has a little more than 81,000 viewers.

The BVB’s marketing, digitalization and internationalization Cramer hopes that besides the normal viewer’s places, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: “It’s of course a hit in the account when these revenues break completely off.”
Given the ongoing corona crisis, all of them are currently “good advice to take a stable side length for the first time.”
"If many companies are not well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer said.
The Dortmund Marketing Chief praised the BVB professionals for their wage resignation, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that their wage resignation has an effect different than when we put 100 people working in the merchandising on short work."
Small Wonders: Early Start in Life With A few hundred grams
Little heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood throughout his body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of approximately 400 early springs, which are served annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a couple - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, neither intestines, nor muscles are completely trained.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that you could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made for them mini windows.
But not so small that they wouldn't be at voice - "and like," smuggled Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even though they don’t cry as loud as big babies.”
When the whiteboard becomes stage

Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the teaching.
Even though all stakeholders were finally agreed that the direct meeting in the theater and stage room would still offer additional encouragements, the theater also sees the potential for contact in schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game operation,” said director Winfried Tobias.

AfD confirmed Kalbitz strip - FDP speaks of "Feigeblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from AfD is from the perspective of the FDP only a "foil sheet" and doesn't change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser said at the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after multi-hour negotiations, the AfD Federal Court of Prosecution confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided mostly in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD would really be about removing right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
“There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now party.”
CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said, “Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing,” he said in the “World on Sunday.”
“It rather speaks bands, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extreme remains in the midst of the AfD.”
Flower expects the AfD to land below five percent in the future.
“The days of AfD in parliaments are counted.”
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially dissolved "flight" around the chairman of the AfD-Landes and the fraction of Thuringia Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection considers the strength as "secured right-extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a former membership in the currently prohibited right-wing "Home true German Youth" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the Leftsfraction at the Brandenburg Landtag, also emphasized that the Federal Court's decision changes nothing to the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten creed.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calbitus.”
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wings will be weakened by this decision.
“The manoeuvre of the Meuthen team is seen.
One wants to escape another observation through the constitutional protection and attempts to go through under the radar,” Walter said.
“The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts she called.
A draft changes nothing,” Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
“Here the AfD Landes Association and the group held to their right leader until today.”
The legal dispute on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now act civilianly against the decision of the Federal Court of Prosecution.
North Sea Wind Parks Supplies About 21% More Electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea have embedded 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the network in the first six months of the year.
These are about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, Tennet’s network operator said in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and for the transmission through the German electricity network.
Wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s networking area, have supplied additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
Overall, the wind stream from the northern and Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
This makes up almost 19 percent of the total wind stream in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacity in addition to wind conditions because new wind farms have gone to the network over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea all run simultaneously with full power, they could produce 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this, according to Tennet it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatt in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we’re investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore net connections,” said Tennet’s business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity on the sea, but reach about 40%.
This year’s previous record day is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks generated more than six gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce approximately 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This allows nearly seven million households to be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a little anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Anniversary of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with the work of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent supplied the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern grain square.
To the north of the gallery, the association was committed to "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day party scheduled in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
“We really didn’t make this decision easy and – in consciousness of how difficult it is to be economically for the stakeholders – hoped until the last minute,” said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
“But ultimately, we are responsible here as an organizer for the health of thousands of people.”
Because if tens of thousands had flown into the festive field and into the festive tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking would not have been able to be observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a feast would not have left much.
Furthermore, the organisation and monitoring burden would rise disproportionately by a multiple times.
Rumberg broke down next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the Winterberg Festival from May 7 to 9, 2021 and the day of Saxony from September 10 to 12, 2021.
Dressure Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten to not beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressing tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old girl from Rheinberg came to four victories on the weekend at four starts.
After she had won a Grand Prix for the start with Weihegold and Quantaz each, she was not to beat at the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and in the curry.
At the 15-year-old Weihegold Stute, Werth on Sunday in the Special was clearly against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on abbaggles.
Also in the curry, the Germans were clearly on Quantaz on Saturday before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werths Siegerpferd Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world’s most successful dressing player will establish the ten-year-old Hengst in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first cure ever.
Even at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four major exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for the 14th to 16th of August.
More flight trips in Worms in the future
The Wormser Hochschule continues to go into the fragrances: the "DFS Deutsche Flugfahrfahrzeuge" creates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the teaching, there is the opportunity to enable the start of the study not only in the summer but also for the winter semester.
This allows students to be trained twice as many as previously.
At the same time, the capacity is loaded uniformly at both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS.
The DFS will consult the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been undergraduate at the Air Traffic Management program at Worms University.
This year, nine students started.
To date, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the benefits of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lot training significantly contributes to further increasing the attractiveness of the lot professional.
“In these times, economically promoting is not easy for us.
We hope that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfill our legal order in the future, we need highly qualified staff,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of DFS in signing the contract.
“For the DFS, the foundation professor is a future-secure investment, which will provide flight lots with a wide, professionally overall knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time encourage our attractiveness as an employer.”
This also emphasizes Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University: “The foundation teacher forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her we want to link to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Luftfahrt as a practical partner for the dual bachelor program Air Traffic Management.”
The trust of Deutsche Luftfahrt is at the same time for Worms University motivation and commitment to further expand its teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of tomorrow’s flight lots, the university with the first foundation professorship can set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stressed: “The Worms University has a single position in Rheinland-Pfalz with its focus on air transport.
Today’s signing of the Cooperation Agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes, the motorway A 45 was fully locked towards Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drive with a Ford at around 12.40 a.m. on the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve straight and landed on the guide plank.

The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of approximately 2000 euros, had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other industries according to meat industry
The corona crisis brought the states in parts of the meat industry to the light again.
Law exhaustions are shortly coming.
But are they right, and will they remain there?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) is seeking to review other industries, according to the currently planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
“We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,” said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers already warn that they should generally restrict work agreements.
Following the massive corona outbreak at the giant meat tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on Wednesday a law of salvation.
Large battles should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel for slaughter, decomposition and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contractors and lending workers is prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said, “Fingers are away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave if you don’t want to completely eliminate the economy.”
Work agreements are, for example, the basis for the vast areas of the craftsmanship, the construction industry and the installation construction of the customer.
“Only individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil said: “My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy.”
Work agreements are meaningful.
“If an industrial company commissions an craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract.”
The German meat economy considers that a ban on work contracts and lease work alone in its industry is unconstitutional.
It is unexplainable why the portion and packaging of cheese in the future should be considered other labour law than worst, a statement on the legislative project, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry in part 16 hours a day, according to the results of an examination of the NRW administration of labour protection.
They often did not have breaks.
Pay has been retained for protective equipment or rental.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law has entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these “trick-rich constructions” have been interrupted.
"Now it has to be basically cleaned."
The politician announced, "In the Labour Safety Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example higher test rates in the labour safety or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft DPA includes amendments to the Law on the Safety of Employee Rights in the Meat Economy and the Labour Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I wish we could make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food checks, animal welfare, everything possible, such as animal transportation," Nonnemacher said in the RBB show on Sunday.
However, for more controls, more staff are also needed.
Three deaths in crash of ultra-light aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft collapsed on a multi-family house in Wesel, Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to police.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people have been rescued in the disaster, a spokesman of the Circular Director Wesel said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, the police say.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane was collapsed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
More details were initially not known.
Spacing of Frankfurter Opernplatz is peaceful
A week after the exclamations in Frankfurt, the space of the Opera Square is also peaceful at night on Sunday.
Lastly, a few dozen people stood on the square, but left it before the start of the lock hour at 1 o'clock.
Since the early evening, the police have been in charge with numerous officials, a larger police bid was to be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on the opera square where it had come to crawls a week ago.
Policemen were attacked out of the number of celebrators with bottles.
At least five police officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car overwhelmed: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar severely injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Humme, a 21-year-old girl suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the Kassel clinic.
With thermal cameras, the firefighters were looking for possible drivers.
According to police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 towards her residential site, when her car left from unclear cause of the road and overlap several times.
In order to save the disadvantages, the firefighters had to cut off the roof of the car.
Because it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was checked from the rotary guide with a heat image camera.
The drone stool from Warburg, which also works with thermal imagery cameras, was also ordered for the person search.
However, the military did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The heavy injured was brought to the Kassel Clinic with the rescue car.
Almost 50 firefighters Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Masters in Italy
Turin - According to a rescue gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus Turin's record championship has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36th scudetto of the club’s history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genova.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who started without the last long-wounded former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing two days before the end of the Series A.
The Inter Milan table range is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless in the first half-time despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free shock variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old, used directly from the criminal space limit with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the more offensive guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dust off.
This secured the bright but decisive success.
The 89th minute Foulelfmeter dropped to the latte could only have Ronaldo himself hunted properly with a view to the Torjacker rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly,” trainer Maurizio Sarri said after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, the Juve Coach said.
Because of the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s ultimate reassuring advantage at the top of the table was also due, above all, to the weakness of competitors.
Because in the eleven matches before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
Whether Ronaldo becomes a King of Tors, it’s questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar had achieved 31 goals until now, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile, after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome, has already contributed 34 hits on his account at Hellas Verona – as many as Robert Lewandowski made to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve Professor Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian won 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the Italian football's "Old Lady" is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, however, on August 7, it has to compete against Olympique Lyon with a 0:1 gameplay to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal cars captured
Despite allen threatened punishments and court judgments, drivers on countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads continue gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, police have already registered more than 250 illegal cars in the southwest.
Although there are no comparison values for the years previously, but the Rasers are increasingly working on the judicial authorities: At the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, in 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as shown from the Ministry of Interior’s answer to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers have spontaneously taken up against each other or they have taken the escape from the police – this is also shown as illegal race.
German men were especially aged between 18 and 60 years old.
113 fines - 15 times in prison
Only in relatively few cases, the grass are captured and also asked to cash: According to the Ministry of Interior, a total of 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 liberty penalties have been issued.
However, there are no points that the number of illegal cars actually increases.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitively than previously because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, a Ministerial spokesman said.
The 8th motorway is especially popular with grassers, and drivers always brake out the traffic there to get space and take advantage of the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was captured near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit there, it is attempted to break out the grass on the particularly affected section between narrow and geissing.
The mostly high-priced and upgraded sports and luxury carrosses often have Swiss marks because the drivers escape to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car driving in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit cannot be reduced to a few distances: “With a general speed limit of 130 miles of hours we would create this problem on highways from the body,” says Martin Rivoir, transport expert at the SPD Landtags Group.
“The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren’t likely to be here and there still legally with 200 miles of hours and more on the road.”
“Whoever takes over all the rules in this way and puts on not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users is hardly accessible with reason.”
ADAC calls for stronger police attacks
However, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Raser will not be disturbed from the pace limits," says Holger Bach, Transport and Environment Director at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder controls on the affected routes.
Not rarely from the high-touring force fair, three people have died in the races from January 2019 to April 2020, two of which have died in a nightly crash in the city centre of Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have a car drive in November.
One of the vehicles departed from the road, rolled against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Other 21 people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary, according to the Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: “Law action needs to harder sanction illegal vehicle races are not seen,” the paper of the Ministry of Interior says.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meetings - Police attacks 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and more than 1,000 people were involved in a Saturday night tuning meeting on the parking place of a furniture house.
The police used their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A large tuning meeting came on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg South City.

Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only Small Part from the "Scene"
The officials counted the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police reported.
However, there is only a small part of the participants in the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene came to the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it is to be assumed that it was mostly scenic.
Furthermore, the largest proportion of the participants in the existing infection protection regulations, in particular the complying with the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed by 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permission was disappeared.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No cars
Illegal cars did not exist.
"The Midfranken Police Presidency will continue to keep the happening in mind and will continue to carry out strengthened control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectacular people," he said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved driving company: “They have all beautiful rims that we cannot scratch,” Schrödinger said.
Special bands were used for this.
Also because the cars are broader, the company must be careful not to make damage.
“The young people should finally receive their cars without harm.”
Numbers of the Employment Agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short labour
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) is following about 900 suspicion cases of abuse in short employment.
“This is extremely little in more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work,” said the Board of Directors of Operational Business Daniel Terzenbach of the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung”.
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly many companies had requested short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more precisely we will look at the final invoices.
There will certainly be a lot of things.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Notices of abuse often came from affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, use BA analytics software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
Will there be much more insolvency than last year?
The estimates go away, but we’re going to apply for the case and already educate our employees in the Employment Agencies to edit applications for insolvency money.”
The numbers are still noticeable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Dissolved party in the New Garden

Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist town
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as state authorities reported in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
Therefore, many of the young infected practitioners are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been positively tested.
Inhabitants, guests and tourism employees were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The closure hour was set at 23:00.

Chelsea, the opponent of the FC Bayern in the Champions League Acht Finals, won Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“This means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as a Chelsea coach also stands in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, who passed past the wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as the sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the remote duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time.
The late guidance of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately resembled Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which has triomed three trainers in the season, decreases after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end there was a point missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp missed the score record in the English football with his team.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) played the Sunday match for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an exceptional season," Torschutter van Dijk said after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League boss will also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, the football operation in England was interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
Meanwhile, even discussed a premature termination or streaming of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without any special events – however, like in Germany without viewers in the stadiums.
arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Israel’s protests against Head of Netanyahu’s government are becoming increasingly violent.
In the night there were violent disputes.
The Israeli police have taken a violent demonstration against Head of Rights Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in trouble, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police, among other things, used watersheders to dissolve the campaign.
According to media reports on Saturday, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s dealing with the corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, bubbled in horns and called Netanyahu for resignation.
Participants in a region demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news page reported "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv according to police reports because he was suspected to have sprayed from a riding car pepperspray on demonstrators on the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The campaigns accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
He is held, among other things, with rapid relief and a lack of preparation for a second corona wall.
The corona crisis has severely added to the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate was last over 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has risen to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter scratches on car - nine injured - Ruhrzone - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rise accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 calls for nine light injuries in Ahlen.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said, “I probably had suddenly burned her because she wanted to bend.”
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter behind her too late.
He cracked back on the car.
Three prisoners in the car and six in the car were slightly injured.
Several rescue cars brought them to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea blocks border town to Corona suspicion
North Korea has previously seen a "light success" in its own measures to protect coronavirus.
The country reports for the first time a suspicion.
Due to a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea completely locked a large city because of fear of a disaster.
Despite the most strict epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been brought into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation has been imposed.
The communist leadership exclaimed the highest alarm level.
If the suspicious case is confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the shot-out country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defence measures as "light success".
The information was doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the disease symptoms were found at a "exhaust" who illegally crossed the military demarkation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person dropped to South Korea three years ago and has now returned over the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly reduced military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea initially.
South Korea’s military, however, as reported by the national news agency Yonhap, acknowledged the possibility of illegal crossing border to North Korea as high.
There were investigations for some people.
North Korea said on Saturday an urgent meeting of the political office of the Labour Party, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, on suspicion.
“The dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster.”
As a preventive measure on Friday, Kim ordered "to completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and region from others."
The person concerned as well as all persons in Kaesong who had contacted her had been placed under quarantine.
The party’s central military commission is therefore to investigate the “exit” and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe punishment.
According to estimates, around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before great summer break to discussion
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the board will vote on the construction plan for the Big City Centre Development-Ost project," he said in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. at the Big Hall of CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Especially the upgrade of the eastern city is discussed until the end.
The majorities are short of this, lastly even refusing in individual committees depending on the presence.
A call from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council, not now failing after almost ten years of preparation, criticized Reinhard Klein as "external parliamentary opposition", "speculation", "relief" and "conscious fakeages".
“Everyone thinks better to know,” said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Civillist.
In fact, after reading the treaties he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, and the Technical City Hall is in contrast to the statements of the municipal administration of subsidies, whose existence Klein is convinced to repair for €8.5 million.
The city will evolve quite differently than forecast in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
The City by its own power and not to design an investor: this was its plan B. One day after Klein introduced the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also refuses the project, an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller-party renovation of the city in ideal cases with local carriers.
Environmental topics play central role
In addition, environmental topics will play a central role.
Thus, the municipal council will vote, among other things, on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheimers from health noise loads caused by road traffic, including several time reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political responsible in the city are not innocent that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting linear bus traffic with slim tacts and by little commitment to bicycle traffic.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis Energy and Climate Protection Agency.
Furthermore, it is on the agenda for the accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Pact, the re-establishment of parents’ contributions in the urban children’s days facilities and the application for the inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal.
Citizens are welcome, but have to take corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts with a lot of delay in the new season
With nearly half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann started in his premiere season at ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the supersports cars can start the regular operation, the first test trips were now held.
For Zimmermann, it was especially about getting to know more about his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener rolled his first rounds on the lausit ring and was able to accustomed to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from Porsche’s previous season,” says Zimmermann.
“With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutch, despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sport, has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” said Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I understand ourselves shining and we also made huge progress at the Lausitzring from session to session.”
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform its first race.
As of 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will shave through the Lausseat.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 Serienneulingen, knows the route.
In 2015, he was last guest in the Motodrome.
“It has worked quickly and I had to get little used to the route,” says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen race community Graf Zeppelin.
“The lausit ring has a lot of fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast.”
How quickly it really is, it comes out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams poker a bit at the tests,” he says.
“In the end, we are very happy and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.”
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
Seven races will be held until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at Nürburgring, former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will get into the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision Cold Caught
The British government’s decision to put Spain’s leave under quarantine for two weeks after return, has coldly seized the country’s traffic minister, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the action on Saturday.
Due to the increased corona numbers in Spain, the London cabinet has broken the country from the list of countries where entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the date of holidays only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers are likely to have known in advance that there is the possibility that a quarantine will be imposed for holidayers in Spain," Labour Deputy Diane Abbot said.
“But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp.”
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict start-up blocks, the infection numbers in the country will rise again.
Virologists are especially responsible for the nightlife for the latest spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the British.
Unnecessary travel to the mainland of Spain, the UK government is currently advising, which is exempt from particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearics among British travellers.
More than 272,000 infections with the new coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.

Hurricane "Hanna" reached Texas: Aid makes it difficult for Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year’s season over the Atlantic was hit on land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, heavy winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the U.S. Climate Authority’s National Hurricane Center reported Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott expressed emergency status for numerous districts.
The Texas-based corona pandemic makes the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuated for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said in the newspaper Houston Chronicle.
He added: “This challenge is complicated and is further exacerbated, considering that it is fed by a territory that is the state’s territory most affected by Covid-19.”
According to the Johns Hopkins University, some 5000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona Pandemia.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes to caution.
They should not mistake practices, "which we used to," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to the CBS broadcast.
It is important that all of them keep away.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, it should be tested on Corona in emergency accommodation.
Damages were first reported only from the coastal town Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Returned
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island right outside the Texas coast.
The Tropenstorm had previously been ranked as a lower-level hurricane one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later removed.
Authorities expected a decline while "Hanna" continued to move into the country's interior and towards the northeast of Mexico.
Douglas moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was traveling towards Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to continue to decrease.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane Wave.
This year, after a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season.
From June to end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected to be, of which up to six very strong storms could become, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year above the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the likelihood of a normal season is only 30 percent, which is even ten percent below the average.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government watched the storms accurately and is in contact with the states concerned.

Sassuolo's Filip Djuric has opened two goals.
Naples - Four goals, four goals opened: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football Serie A League a black evening - and was really excited on the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard against a team ever," the "Corriere dello Sport" commented.
Host Naples was guided by a gate of outside defense Elseid Hisaj in the eighth minute, in the 32th minute Filip Djuric initially enjoyed the compensation.
The Video Assistant Counsel (VAR) took the hit back due to an away position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball once again into the net - again attacked the VAR.

The new technology provides records,” writes Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The launch in the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a return for Doublewinner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few training days, Hansi Flick recovered “so good” has to consider after the first team training as he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of the champion Benjamin Pavard.
The French, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Middlefield Chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury on the left foot root and threatened to miss in decisive royal class duels.
In Munich, the legal defender broke a training game and was driven from the square with a golf category.
How long the unlimited stam player has to pause in the struggle for the title is open.
An eighth-final back match against FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult to play, on which the 24-year-old will hope the final tournament beginning on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians don’t want to stop from the mischief of training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick called the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way in Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show their victorious title collectors in the following 28 days until the final royal class match on August 23.
“We just mastered the duty with championship and cup.
Now it’s necessary to create the special thing,” Flick said.
Until Munich’s final tournament and earlier a training camp at the Algarve are able to deal specifically, however, the eight-final requirement is the first time against FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 game before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bavaria nightmare again as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
“We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good prerequisites and tank trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A test for alignment will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long talk, Flick swore his stars, who had had a 13-day holiday after the Double, on a single August.
He welcomed 31 players on the Sabener Road, including the new players around Edel Shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the square after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all new ones, has gone well," Flick said.
However, instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is not allowed to coach, Flick rather spoke about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single- and small-group training is now trained in team force for the Londoners who are in the gambling rhythm unlike the Flick set.
Afterwards, a quarter-final could be upcoming against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi; in the semi-final, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not so simple," emphasised the coach, who can trust the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record shooter Klose and Flick know about such a number of common tournament preparations, which is particularly important for the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, the work is “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The “focus on winning” is an imposing track of its team.
At the Nine-Team tournament, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the service providers were there, including Thiago and David Alaba, whose remains are not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cut its world champion
Since it cannot be driven on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to grant the World Cup title.
All American races have been cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the up to date confirmed Grand Prix, three other racing tracks were added under the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão will be driven.
On the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. struggle around World Cup points on the Italian traditional crossroads in Imola.
This includes the 2020 race calendar 13 races according to the current stand.
“We are happy to continue making great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motorsport are to be completed during this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 will finalize its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi already officially launched in December, media reports said there could be still events in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires races on three continents
The rule of Formula 1 requires races on at least three continents for the award of the World Cup.
Even though, as currently planned, only on two continents is driven, there is a world champion.
Using a special rule, the FIA wants to award the title with "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the beginning of the coronavirus.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
Furthermore, Formula 1 will not be guest in America this year.
Refuse in Brazil on criticism
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the US, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them next season,” said Carey.
The rejection of the American races was criticized above all in Brazil: "The rejection came not surprisingly for us, but the reasons we cannot accept it," said Tamas Roonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the numbers of infections in the area of São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to drive in Brazil would also not justify any rejection.
We are prepared for the required safety measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil sight against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was guest in Stephen Colbert’s famous Latenight show by video switching and interviewed what she had in her mind in her meeting with Donald Trump.
Climaatkivist Greta Thunberg was guest by video switching in a popular US latenight show.
She, among other things, told about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad eye" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg, with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement, made attention to herself.
Now she spoke about her plans in the future in a well-known Latenight show and her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight-moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far are people going to drive the focus away from the climate crisis,” she shocked.
“All from organized hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children goes on the street,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock against them in social media or even try to silence, they find them "pleasant" as they show her the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it."
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look afterwards U.S. President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the act visitor sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view has been captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the internet.
From the short clip, a GIF created, i.e. an animated picture, which ultimately became one of the most commonly used pictures for Trump’s opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this moment?
She answered Stephen Colbert's relatively open question: "To be honest, I think that doesn't need any further explanation."
With the finished answer, the experienced Satiriker Colbert probably did not expect and disappeared shortly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?"-speaking on the principles of climate protection, she remained reminded of many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like an achterbahn ride: after a quick rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downwards and then slowly back upwards.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional reaction, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a "monumental loss" for all previous and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled an achterbahn ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise – the band celebrated its biggest successes but then without him.
It is supposed to have been disputed, among others, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide clothes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems have also played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
Green has been treated for a long time in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the image surface.
He was supposed to live on the street, working as a cemetery garden and spent a time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In a young age, he was enthusiastic for U.S. blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later gained the chance to stand as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly later, he was committed to the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed its shadows: Green did not force the media round, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
At the end of the decade, Green succeeded surprisingly in 1979 with an album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac, without him, snowed into a new formation on a success wave.
Her album "Rumours" released in 1977 sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not succeed in a larger comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star returned to Earth at the time.
Free of drugs, Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend at the time of life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
