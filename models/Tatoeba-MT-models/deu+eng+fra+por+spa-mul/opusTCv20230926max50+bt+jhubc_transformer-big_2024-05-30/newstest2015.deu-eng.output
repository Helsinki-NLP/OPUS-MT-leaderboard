Police in Karratha arrested 20-year-old after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before debugging into the Bushland, where the officials lost it from their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old of failure to observe a stop signal as well as unconscious driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He was accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she was “consciously sleeping and could not signal agreement.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae held the negotiation date for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconsideration of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as citizen law.
"Like trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus at Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Authority Act together with the Civil Rights Act John Lewis.
This basic law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination due to the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops forces that are so anti-unionised.
The complement of the national Labour Law Act to create a possibility for discrimination to organisation a trade union representation in order to complain for justice before a civil court - and to maintain damage or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - anyway not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the retreats exposed to the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and comply with labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stab encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the workers' rights to union and joint negotiations and action are guaranteed."
As the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stab urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and their voice should be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions will guarantee every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to minimize it are null and null; measures targeting it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt owned the chairmanship of the International Human Rights Commission, designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everybody has the right to form trade unions or interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that workers’ rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union can then participate in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
After these rights came under shooting in America, it is really very wise to look back to the American ideal, therefore the working population must have the right to unite and hear in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work in a wonderful way created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unpredictable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of work rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of citizens rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' attitudes - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and induced the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
An U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which the lawyer says it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, was put for law in June and to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortion to acquire a patient intake law at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to practice.
However, the judge's decision means that physicians can continue to conduct legal abortions provisionally while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in compliance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to make a more durable decision for the law.
Advocates of abortion welcomed the decision that the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors have been considering more time to gain hospital invoice rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana will escape a misleading law that wants to take their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the appeal and had also applied for input rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional.
Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that invoice rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents oppose that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-in-law rights, the Center for Reproduction Rights told.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to no longer perform abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery because of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the Louisiana State said they would not be punished by doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient rights were still attached.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video homage for her mother online, who died from ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australian areas, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who found ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 per cent five years after the diagnosis were still alive.
Research manager Susan Jordan from the QIRM Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in city areas.
Small study: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied women’s medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases, as well as the social and economic status also influenced survival chances.
For older women and those whose cancer was already further advanced at the diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city with greater probability died from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspected delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter the distances, she suggested, as a possible remedie, a reinforcement of the service of flighted doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study found a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and pre-care strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach HTA’s study, as reported in the Financial Times, the “Core Age Group for Garden Products”.
The report states that tenant spends an average of 55% of the amount people spend home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular processes, pre-gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated £5 billion are being implemented in sale annually.
In the largest area of London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular among tenant for example because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of garden retail due to increasing numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Clerk Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital city of Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators have turned down the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters from PTV buildings again.
The broadcast started its operation for about 40 minutes, but now it returns.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied clashes with security forces equipped with stacks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he rejected that.
The country’s army calls for a political solution to the conflict, “to waste without time and to apply without violence.”
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role to guarantee the security of the state."
The military has played an important role in Pakistan and has already wiped out more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan said he had deceived Premier Sharif at the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to penetrate Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints U.S. diplomacy for spying reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s largest U.S. diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dropped the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying each other.
An earlier report that Germany’s most important intelligence department also had Ankara in the vision provided significantly more angry reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning Strike: Local guide threatens with consequences for Pendlers
The national warning strike of the local guide on Monday evening could also impair passenger transport in NRW.
The committee announced for 18-21 a.m. represents all nationally transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main direction of the warning strike is the freight traffic.

District Chairman of the German Locomotive Führer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, Düsseldorf, said.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional focus.
The main direction of the warning strike is the freight traffic.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences specifically.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented on Friday evidence to Mallorca’s prosecutor’s office of expulsion by police officers and employees in the city of Calvià.
Calvià’s police chief at Mallorca’s holiday island was arrested in the famous Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf, according to allegations of corruption by businessmen and barbecue owners.
Main Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most Magaluf bars and nightclubs lie, after allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence on Friday to Mallorca’s Attorney’s Office for Corruption Combating by police officers and Calvià’s employees.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the angry night club owners stated that the authorities’ infantry economy has serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showcasing a 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during an out-tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholized travelers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the famous alcohol-related knee surroundings.
The Playhouse Club, in which the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneepround Organizer Carnage jointly need to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is popular especially among young British travellers, is also known for some accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from balcony to the other or from balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
FÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy sharpness and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21:00 another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already dropped down to Sunday at night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, storm-sharp cracks, including a casting that began just before 20 a.m. and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum value of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The harmful weather conditions likely have led to the late landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 however, it was hit by a wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Wind blows reached approximately 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport at that time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to start through a second landing approach and finally launched at about 20.40 a.m.
The flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide on Tuesday, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted, with possible sharpness.
Matthies says: Maximum time for big networking
Given the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my eye falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable wasn’t, all listeners would fly in the house in a short time, and that would be even significantly more retro.
Does it apply to the Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic)?
No, tipping errors: electronic) sector the rule that today’s world newness is the electrical crash of tomorrow, purchased - older.
And, for example, whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, he simply says that he basically rejects TV.
Why these considerations?
Because the Ifa’s streaming at the radio tower this week leads us back to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who previously dominated the blind washing machine and CD player, today doesn’t even understand the purpose of the devices spread before him with an incredible expert speech: “Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies” promises us.
Yeah, it's still going?
What should we talk about to people who seem to be voluntary to spread such a quark?
For about 20 years, it’s essentially about connecting our house.
So the yogurt re-orders itself, so the fire reporter on vacation in the Maldives informs us that it is burning in the work room.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we from the office the air conditioning at our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: we lift our clock, say "sucking!" and the dust agroboter runs out at home.
Irre.
Everything goes beyond nothing less than a revolution: "Swimming the boundaries between white and brown goods," a branch acquaintancing, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza needs in the oven, but nothing benefits because we stand in the storage.
From daily practice we also know that if a new-model device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio positions.
Israeli children return to their schools after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection spaces, while missile and mortal shot down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area was recovered from the struggles.
The school launch brought the communities drawn by missile holes in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh Children's Garden, hit by a missile, were removed before the student arrived granate splitters from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a bit afraid, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit strange" to go back to school suddenly.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further into safer areas away from Gaza and escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar granate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not returned yet.
Their children were housed temporarily in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, heavily drawn by the Palestinian shooting.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that they gain knowledge and offer you safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to an unlimited ceasefire.
The ceasefire ended the struggles immediately; however, important problems remain unsolved, such as Hamas’ demand for a revocation of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for a dearmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fights.
A new round of indirect conversations is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the estimates of Palestinians and the United Nations.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the deaths are fighters, but did not present any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters fired 4,591 missiles and mortar granates in Gaza during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were rebuilt into temporary protective spaces.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective spaces and the struggles continue, educational authorities have moved the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will soon be opened again so that we can learn further, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy, currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl disputes NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl pronounced the end of the current NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the head of CDU country in Baden-Württemberg, the Leipzig Volkszeitung.
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is fighting politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed on Sunday’s five-percent vote.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing party was failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had also in the NPD reporters at the time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe.
Federal Government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents at the New Zealand place.
The headquarters for refugees in Harburg breaks from all seams.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
District politicians were informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions continue to retain the citizens and do not give district politicians a chance to constructively participate in the human accommodation of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party calls for the district administration of Harburg to currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first recording are the storm of assistance seekers - and the circumstance that the authorities cannot provide enough places in consecutive facilities.
Therefore, many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
This increase in June, July and August is 4.2%, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9%, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months by August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research manager Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data’s figures show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by average five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hard hit by the cuts of state expenditures and where prices over the year only increased by 1.4%.
Mr. Lawless continued to say that with the beginning of spring now would be an increase in the properties for sale for the next few months that would undergo the market "a real test".
“If you consider the continuously high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuously low interest environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further in the next three months,” he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he objects to statements by the CEO Peer Medau and attests him to posing "as a field master".
The style of the university is not that, it says in the communication.
The Medau family has already been informed orally about the university’s education in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were known until July is definitely wrong,” said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "definitions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was a nine meters wide road and it is not talking about.
According to the current stand, it goes around 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than previously," explains Pötzl.
The medal operators’ argument that their free and educational parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future will not allow Pötzl to apply.
Parking is not at all because it can be solved intelligently, like in other public parking places.
Think of the inhabitants
The child’s cattle, which is located on the ground and in front of its doors would lead access to the park deck, is not to be affected, according to the president of higher education.
Rather, he says, "this is not just about the child's cribs, but also about the inhabitants at the invasion of the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it’s much more about the particulate interests of Mrs Medau,” said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental advisory council of the Children's Crib, with the expansion of the road, would be entitled to lose a "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" "can the reader decide himself".
In early October, Pötzl, along with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils of the building development of the university by 2020 and to address in this context the importance of new development.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the child crib last week about the plans of the university.
As a result, the access to the new park deck is not to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Road, but over the Medau Mountain.
This means that the narrow road should be expanded to approximately a kilometer of length.
According to the Medaus highlights, the traffic in the park of Castle Hohenfels would increase ten times.
Approximately 2,000 vehicles per day are talked about.
From the sides of the city we have not yet wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf retreats from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt brought about health issues for this decision.
I didn’t easily make the decision, it has been mature for several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team,” the World Champions of 2007 said on his Facebook page.
He therefore goes to the international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the violent backspace player for the Champions League winner in Flensburg wants to go on hunt for a few years, he is now no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who on Tuesday announced his head of country matches against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation."
His ideas and approaches have just as excited me as they will excite my long-standing players and successors.
But I want to be healthy for my club in the next few years too, longer regeneration pauses are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
In 2012, the leftman had to fear his career end after a heel infection.
Due to problems with Achilles, he had been allowed to treat himself with a cortison syringe by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB), which later caused strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career will not pass away from any body.
I have some health buildings that I cannot ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which were carried out in 2012 in short intervals, I never managed my blood pressure properly.
Some other wear-related complaints come to this.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that though I can control my head, but I can’t deceive my body,” Glandorf told the magazine “Handball Time”.
He would only be ready for a comeback in absolute emergency.
"When all the strikes break, I'm always ready to talk," the two-family father told the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became pretty humble with regard to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of the Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy reduced by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have burned the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product declined by 0.2% from April to end of June 2014 compared to the pre-quarter.
This was notified by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumption lived the economy in spring, while the investments dropped.
Foreign trade also broke down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual launch, a total GDP plus of 0.8 percent results for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and target of the "Münsterland Mooist", which led through the Burgmannstown on Sunday for the first time.
The castle town Horstmar on Sunday experienced an invasion of Dutch "featers".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Munsterland Mooist".
It is the biggest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked for their application to Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
Written in various specialized magazines, this tour was offered to interested people.
We came from the heroes and went overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way, too," the cyclists looked forward to the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Vereinsheim of the Schutzbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start was also done.
Furthermore, the route, which was enrolled for three different categories, led to Horstmar towards Herrenholz over the Schoppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On tracks of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care on the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all stakeholders.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped came, which was probably on the poor weather forecasts and in the morning rain.
“We hope to see ourselves again in 2015 in beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend,” the cyclists promised, however, to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Constantin Awacker's Honest Memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought to paper Konstantin Awaker, Liedmaker, Pacifist, politically secure activist, former prisoner, in "Monch and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Munichner, born on 1 June 1947, wrote his memories, each chapter launched by a suitable song text.
And he is honest: From Onania as a gymnasist to the shop theft and drug use he does not leave human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his neighbors.
Wide space also takes on abstract, but the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all of that he tries to go on the ground, in very philosophical, but also very personal manner.
And he also explains his Pacifism, his societal criticism, his political commitment – and also, as he has not only shaped music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought Lebemann Konstantin Awacker closer to the Ascetic monk, which is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary."
However, there are also short anecdotes to the Earth between all the high-spiritual views: for example, about fighting in a locally frequented by GIs or a crazy car drive where he invited a tree frontal.
He is honest there too.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaica immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work for some difficult childhood moments.
He visited “many” therapies after his mother’s death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the crack.
Leave your sister in peace.
Move!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a caster in Dudley, and although conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life was liked for him.
It's now a little brighter, but they're dark, black, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of rush.
My father just slept in the tub earlier and then he could slowly hear how he started singing because he could wash the casting of himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimony.
My father never embraced me, he never said, "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop embracing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn’t we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friendly with French whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn’t we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetician.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I passed through this fitness and also had to make a drastic diet to turn the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is taken up by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Irrions, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to be grown not only in the eyes of the public, but also learning from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage law at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “painted black,” Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never happen, but I don’t regret that I did it.
It was a distinctive, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with giant projects and learned how to handle a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotest parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went to ship in 1984, and in the nineties he was, among other things, known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy Series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but according to his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What do you do next, Len, because everything feels like you just bring the time or get a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary array for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was actually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything right about him at school and considered him predominantly as a domain of the middle class, white in pants and a collar head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words into your mouth, then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry introduced 20 rows from Othello’s last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost like someone finally put up my head right.
“That’s why it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
“A little voice told me, ‘You have to overwhelm 10 minutes now while repairing the computer.’”
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You play in a play, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the teeth.
This also came well, so it’s like a great shield of the gods who tell me, ‘This is your destiny.’”
He says this, of course, with a donating voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love it.
I love being in a trial room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorful outbreaks while he always imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you’re always looking for it, you’re going ahead of a wall.
Sometimes I’m going live at Apollo when I like it, but overall I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director that helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip – I don’t think I want to give up this ever again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think that's right.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
They always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers would have occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi party said “Ansar Allah.”
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-Leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the action on Sunday night.
Huthi, according to the sheet, threatened another escalation of the conflict if his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis struggle for more independence from Sunni ruled Yemen and call for the government’s resignation.
The Huthi people’s tribe has been settling the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on Sanaa’s large access pathways.
In the surrounding country there are always bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered officials to remove "geist employees"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometrically in order to delete "geist employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive payments even after their farewell from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service at his office in 2013.
In an examination earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month lost payments for "traffic employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or left the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at Identification Centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be deleted from the salary list, the communication continued.
“This action is significantly contributed to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also cleaning the salary list at both government levels – thus the “geographic workers” are eliminated,” said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal around the Kunst Advisor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on November 11.
Five inheritants of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand in a civilian trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht compensation for €19.4 million from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings.
A court speaker said this on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach deceived when purchasing artworks and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This also made the agreed commission higher.
Achenbach has purchased items worth 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school service, of which 23 as a school leader.
At that time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his desire to see the people in the student.
The snow copper is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/North Bohemia in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was interested in teaching after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were dismantled.
Within half an hour the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the goods wagon.
Thus, the judge is overwhelmed to the overfrenching Senkendorf.
The teacher education was held in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week ten kilometers to the next train station, drive the train to Bamberg, drive three kilometers throughout the city to school and return at night.
After two months, Manfred Judge received a sleep opportunity in a red-cross home in Bamberg: along with up to 15 co-schools in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher office for him, he acquired himself to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fraulein room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, in the newly built teacher house next to the school, he gave a three-room service apartment.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen in the Today’s Town Hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to escape a back ranking in the now smaller school, then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and thus the children and their teachers were able to get today’s construction, which was expanded in 1997 after Judge’s retirement.
Manfred Judge praises the uncomplicated generosity of the Mayor Ludwig Götz, who also made a workspace build on municipal costs and at the expansion in 1997, although that was unsubsidible in accordance with the guidelines for school buildings.
"Citizenmaster Götz was very school friendly," judge recalled thankfully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Judge has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had answered to a referendum of a school board on law and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Judge removed what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always succeed." Whether he just thinks of his students or just like his own six children, it's not clear.
In any case, Judges’ doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they did not get criminal work from him, nor were they told to seat themselves.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box gloves and left the two counterparts to engage each other, even if there was a veil at the time.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rector had a good relationship with the Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the unmarried judge after his retirement to candidate at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judges were elected on sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists put intermediate stops in the park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If Radlers make rast on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in themselves.
On Friday alone, however, the number of cravings made impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 wheel tour together with Begleittros enjoyed a break in the lower park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the sky in the Schottener Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Raddling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the raddlers took the first stage, 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was launched by the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed, and the head of the ownership of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, was welcomed.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of things were prepared for good things: the land women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, wetchen, strusel and cheese cakes that wonderfully moundered the talented radgers.
"Such cakes can only bake a landwife," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
At the beverage level of the Turnverein Geiss-Nidda, cold refreshments were achieved.
The "Duo Bravo" discussed visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applauses.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park looked relaxing.
A master also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved, finally, he has refastened bicycle chains already jumped today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of Reporter Rainer Janke’s drinking house and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Head of promotion Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 wheel tour in 2004 as a tour manager, could only snug shortly, but he had plenty of to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with three phones and a radio with his staff and the Hessen police’s 15-headed motorcycle stack, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he told, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia are travelling cyclists.
The number of participants depends a little on the accommodation capacity available.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II accommodations in collection.
From the resort the radders had a good impression when they broke up again after an hour and a half, "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they signed for goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the raddlers were asked in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive environment and of course, it had been prepared for leaches, such as flame cake with well cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Business Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors as a Board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were clearly delighted by the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open sky was eagerly used despite the sports activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests increasingly mixed citizens who were done by good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb – including a concert with the Trenkwalders – were on the program for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of wheels, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reporting local media agencies.
Police did not comment immediately.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the investigations of corruption against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a series of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal union and phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist Clerk Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told journalists waiting there that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September holidays were not held in any school.
The sky is not everywhere peaceful over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People’s Front must struggle for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school leader of the school in Slavjansk, attending Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory trail from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own border experience.
Her career began with the global management advisory company Bain and Co., where she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the mother company’s senior post went to a younger male colleague.
Her debit was allegedly £1 million.
Their political ranking is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet’s advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
In May, I described the task of the president with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inside the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and trouble when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost sustainable duopol that requires a complete reform.
But whoever newly coming chairman would risk it to compete on everything and separate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps carrying himself out his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that’s not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC decreased - power, money and status overcome.
While competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special hazards.
For the modest amount of £145.50 a year, the UK’s public is buying to the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pens per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising upwards on the popularity scale: 53% support today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The BBC’s view and use habits have changed: today I get news lines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and substantial institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decreasing comment on the Democratic District State Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account that cancels the previous.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I didn't approve the tweet and deleted it," he said in the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry’s official user account were out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
The previous tweet drafted an inadvantageous picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 for driving.
Perry launched a veto against a financial support of her office when she refused to withdraw, which led to an accusation against Perry - which might be presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
“I don’t always drive drunk with the threefold permissible alcohol level... but if I do it, I’m complaining about Governor Perry if he explains it.”
I am the most drunk Democratic in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry calls for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal aids requested in the judge entrusted with the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the best governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally broadcast.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto made a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing at the election meeting in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidate as a fifth, Perry took into speculation that he will stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley declares home market again as "normal"
One of London’s most prominent construction entrepreneurs pointed out that the housing market in southeast England was “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly desired and the subject of huge price rises, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble, urged to set higher limits for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level of 2013" and added that it offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well placed during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the catastrophe, the prices in the town area alone have risen by 18.5% last year, much more than the average rise in England and Wales.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by approximately one fifth last year and at the end of April £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been scared by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "ville tax" before the general elections in May.
London’s real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, in which sharper loan schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday shows a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London down to 3% for 2015, based on a house price awareness already now weak.
The volume of transactions in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter annually, WA Ellis said.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for date sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result date sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April – almost one-third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40% annually to £280 million, the revenue by 18% to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that income for Berkeley in the current year is expected to match the current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley stocks were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon in London’s trade.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are genuine and accused the hacker of "exclaiming violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by Apple’s iCloud online storage system. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who watch photos that my husband and I taken in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're so satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Niccolodeons "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues, however, that it is about pictures of her handles and tweeted, "These so-called naked pictures of me are GEFALLST, people.
Let's go to the beginning. *Word game is intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman of the popstar Ariana Grande rejected her authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They crashed, so they could best describe it, they slowly dissolved as a cardboard you left standing in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, stressful, intense, distant and perhaps a bit scratching.
And then shake his hand.
He knew it.
He was stacky, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stallency was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for a relief of his life’s lonely boredom than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompaniment who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the name Paradise Valley.
For several years, nobody had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaked, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked sneakers had left their traces on all windows and believed that it belongs to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a kindergarten, both threatening and attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had seated with Ailinn on the break-in bed chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been in the serving console, who had remembered the country with a long-standing music and entertaining news, when the sight of their crushed brown beins had been forgotten to remember his closed house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to its own aggressivity, such songs were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The overall taste achieved what decrees and regulations would never have succeeded, and how people in books chose the memories from the washer to the millionaire, cooking books and love romans, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the Euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing big feet in Ailin’s gross-comic Serenade.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started a game between him and his father when he was still little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told it.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t a very fun game now.
He knew that this was expected from him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard anyone.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not prohibited directly.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "when" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz about his father's half-secret old CD collection.
But at least he did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compatible society meant that every element of this society was grateful to agree to the principle of group capacity - grateful as those saved from fate.
People with African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, i.e. they sang and ran.
People who originated from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What remained from the Polish community was taking care of the channelization; what remained from the Greeks was crushed dishes.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT HAVE WAR IF THIS HAVE WAR -- because of fear of being accused of fire scientific accusations, even because of fear that the flames would consume them next -- had been opened with the Labneh and Shisha unrepresants.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Because she had heard only ballads, it was hard to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just prepared her, could ever be verted.
Music was an expression of love.
“They are not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of safety.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailin didn’t understand yet.
Why should your father love that thing?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was somewhat distinctive.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shocked her head unbelievers and shut Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncoated black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
“If you say it,” she mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you intend to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too large?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't directly.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my anks are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick anks are exactly the reason why you're wrong with me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse there.
That sounded not right.
It was supposed to be strange.
When he tried to be strange, he often brought himself in trouble because, like his father, he didn’t have the calming charm needed to condemn the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomon's became red and rise from her living chair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drank.
Holunder-flower wine, so drunkness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel attracted to you perverse," she said.
Except that I'm not that.
She was sorry for both the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear shown in her eyes when she rise against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She hadn’t told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more confusing after what they had been as their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to lift their hands against a woman who refused or laughed.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn’t watch!
They first knit - knit was the most commonly used word for an erotical attractiveness between men and women, a countergift to the unsaying love ballads from the console - they knit and then beat them.
According to Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knitting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the chair like an old man.
She also felt blurred, but the grief of her sorrow surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew themselves.
She looked at him as he walked away – as from a room on the upper floor looked at her companion – a man complained by something he himself had caught up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bumped her back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well if she couldn’t remember a single time she had ever seen such a thing before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
A few years before the recent incidents, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative surveillance body for public mood, had been invested in a brief talk about continuing violence at low and medium-sized levels of energy and the most anticipated of their reduction, if not married,
"It has already been done a lot, and a lot has to be done yet," she wrote, "to relieve the innate aggressivity of a people who led a thousand wars and gained most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness historically has been rarely felt despite the high-aring church towers.
But some properties appear to be irrottable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The people cry when hearing sentimental ballads, drunk about difficulties overcome stories and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former rawness holds the rural communities in the hands as well as our urban structures, but there are even evidence of the emergence of a new and confusing addiction on the streets, on the house.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to overdrive,” her mentor said when he readed the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nuss Tree lowered her head.
I have to ask: Are you atheist?
“I don’t think I have to say that,” answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme once again referred to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again silence.
“I don’t ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz finally, “because I would be against atheism, lesbians or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praised, can occasionally distort results as you imagined them.
You have obviously prejudice against the Church, and those things that you call “intercontaining” and “raw” could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to walk around what is doing when it is doing, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country’s essential life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED draft in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballades, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the songed word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to be," answered Esme Nussbaum with quiet voice when she was sure that her superintendent had finished speaking, "and I say nothing else than we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that we may find ourselves, without a warning, how we repeat the mistakes that were at all to what is going on when it is going on.
This time, however, they are not the others to whom we leave our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to explain an angels’ suffering.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call actions as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You’re also going too far if you’re talking about that these would have left their “would” and “mistrust” to “others.”
In fact, it should not be necessary to remember someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "other".
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From that, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme dared to reject, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not complaining anyone.
Whether it was done bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said anymore - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, no guilt has to be deleted either if such removal was appropriate and if there was a way to delete it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it...
The past serves to forget it.
If I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz left his pyramid to fall down.
"I'm going to remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, had driven on the foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho disputed planning a government strike to fall down and said they were accused of police who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the country’s army surrounded its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting attack threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no state strike but that the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arms were on by the police.
“What happened this morning was that Lesotho’s defense forces’ stab acted after receiving several intelligence reports that inside the police act some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly ahead of it to cause devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a crash.
“Even if no one has claimed to have broken the government by violence, all reports agree that Lesotho’s defense forces’ activities so far show a state strike,” he said.
On Sunday, spokespersons of the Lesotho military told the soldiers to return to their castles and the situation in the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thaban’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target deadline because of his attempt to fight the corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane’s parliamentary meetings were exposed due to the disputes in his united government.
He said his actions had not untermined the government, despite different accusations.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month depth
Increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a study said.
The final Markit Shopping Manager Index of the Productive Commerce (PMI) fell to 50.7 in in August, following a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced incursions in a time of increasing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect from the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the eurozone and the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculation that ECB Head Mario Draghi could provide further information over the course of this week whether he would consider quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the breaking impact of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties has become more clear for manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as Italy’s decline from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism of Germany as well as Spain and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring, too,” said Dobson.
The decline in the industry probably leads to the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Industry Expert at IHS Global Insight, said, “The best thing to say for the shopping manager index of the production industry in the eurozone of August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are currently obviously rather difficult as the current increased geopolitical tensions, especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly impaired the economy - in particular, and the trust of consumers, and are likely to lead to some orders delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said it will be "ever more likely" that the ECB should finally start a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken as hostages at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the abomination in the classroom.
Just a decade after the absurd siege of the Beslan School, where 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night from a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists, children and parents captured and killed on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into hate, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the abomination in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war, which now comes to Ukraine, and in which children like them die, will now end.
The girl photographed attempting to climb back to the shooted school hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the broken school hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was totally confused for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at that time.
My legs were overflowed.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them safe.
After a number of operations, she felt she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some granate splitters are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people help her by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says fightingly.
“This happened to me, and you can’t change it.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am happy that many people in the world still remember our terrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the picture of myself online as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help that something like this doesn’t happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball rod thinks his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara arms.
When he was seven-year-old, he said, "Mommy told me to sit down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said, "Run."
With fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying child on the road, grabbed him in his hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son into his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was stolen outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand assuming her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and covered me.
Damir was later flighted to London (from the newspaper News of the World now dissolved) to get the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror pursues you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say it will be blazing in my memory.
I remember, right after that, I drove all my toy guns away.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and this is no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the courtyard and didn’t get outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy store where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upward open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered.
This horror pursues you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help you so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me at the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband meeting in London, and how Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir liked to eat Borsch and called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with staffers at a restaurant, Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn’t like to remember this, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When he was little, he suffered underneath - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, greater than me, beautiful, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around, and looked around the hell, with parts of the body around me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have survived impossible.
“I remember that I called him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
This is how life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, a picture of Georgij today
His overflow of blood was drawn by fear when he ran for his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan’s barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had stopped him for his first school day before she left to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
“I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three horrible days alone,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day to remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes of these days always pursue me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
The picture of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was everlasted as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the book shelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: “It’s important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ve ever known the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
“I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
It takes dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
Later I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
This is why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September is closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friend tribute.
It’s hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived although he was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijev was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was captured in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
“We feel like it had been yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but couldn’t do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and really felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - then - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never go back there again and please ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of herself in hospital after shelter on the laptop
My pain is huge and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm physically fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical documents, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my kids about my experiences.
Children should not know about it, and they should not suffer it, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is closer.
I will go to the celebrations to memory.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, all of them are drawn here in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgij is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but doesn’t play sports.
I would say he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always pursue us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cry for the killed.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life continues, even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumps into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I almost cannot believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If we could only catch all of these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was carried in safety by a special operation command
Saved: Aljona Tskaeva is brought safe by a Russian special command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty, they held their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderous gem.
Her father Ruslan has since married again and has married his new wife Swetlana a little girl whom he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, 10 years old today, doesn’t remember the settlement and is growing up to a smart and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,” a close friend says.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of passing girls in fife on walking
A 78-year-old man stands in court because of the trial of a three-year-old girl on a walking trail in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of attacking a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward directed his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denounced the charge before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC launched the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there are a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are to have for about $300.
I picked these photos at a family festival with multiple cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closed.
Also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording modes to optimize the exposure time for the insular underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not clip.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, not action cams usually.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that makes a series of recordings with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the more you get away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when making pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go closely to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: these devices often have a solid wide-angle lens, which means you need to approach your objects more densely if they want to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things even in a giant organization as the NHS.
As a consulting anesthesia doctor, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mainly occupied with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May this year.
I was struggling to get up.
While he was fighting with the influenza-like symptoms, he noticed that he accused his wife Juliet with impatience.
"I rather want everything immediately than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt uncommon and without reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray investigation of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination occurred.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an inhealable cancer that attacks the breast cell, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are sick of lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have previously been smokers.
But mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which was once recognized as a "wonder material" but was now recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has no longer been used in the UK since the 1960s than the industry voluntarily committed to no longer use it.
Also where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clampers, construction workers, roommen and shipping workers, for example.
As an industrial dangerous material from a different time it seems hardly worriing today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, today experiences the highlight of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths due to mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
A total of 2,500 deaths per year twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999, all types of asbestos have been prohibited), is that a mesothelium develops only after decades.
And the beat of Mesothelium is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant stores in London to private schools, are no protection space.
Parliament buildings are asbestost.
Also in hospitals where we should be healed, we have already been described as the starting corner of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clipper either.
It was actually difficult for him to imagine where he might have come in touch with asbest.
Then he found out.
"It looks like in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos present," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my ages will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who were sick at Mesothelium in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us are still going to be sick?
Mesotheliom was diagnosed with Andrew Lawson at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of mesotheliomers die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are still going to be sick?"
UK’s leading expert at Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, says that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestosemia in the UK is expected to fall, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be victimized.
Most of them have no idea that they will die like this.

A brief look at the cases of the courts to which the persons concerned often turn for damage compensation demonstrates how far the beat of the mesotheliome is already widespread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, agreed to have negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbest.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20s.
“About this,” she says, “I had never heard of Mesothelium, I didn’t even really know anything about asbest.
I never thought that would affect me once.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbest is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestosform", a description of the fiber structure which makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulation, boileri insulation, even for brake bearing in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO as a “big health risk” with potential death.
However, more dangerous is brown asbest (amosite) and blue asbest (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbest, and experts suspect that "it's clear but indirect indications that this was a key reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates."
Marks & Spencer’s employee was exposed to Alamy in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelium victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study from the subjects showing that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliome without known suspension by work or home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people could have been unknownly exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be ripped up by something as harmless as “strong air movements”.
Parliament members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service stressed that the Westminster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now unquestionable that one billion £ should be employed for several years to renovate the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the Asbest center, and that after the general elections in 2015, the MEPs will be more likely in the West.
The Goddard report also pointed out that “the presence of asbest was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions.”
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medical professional.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It’s so difficult to remember all the places you’ve worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009 when he had such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and late in the evening he carried out a surgery.
Suddenly I had frost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I didn’t make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the breast tissue that skin surrounded his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelium.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised physicians made X-rays of his chest and use pleurakathethers to remove liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sporting exercise and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient came in practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s state deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast shell.
I am an optimist.
I’m usually going on,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t have so much worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelium."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan sisters, one of which recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos,” he says.
The people exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestosisolation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who eaten in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground cantines (as Graham Abbott often did), most likely came in contact with the toxic substances.
It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for doctors treating.
It is removed today too.
Students put their buns burners on asbestos mats.
It doesn’t only affect hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulation and flame-retardant properties.
Even schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their bunse burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often discussed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our houses, such as floor plates or slip roofs, have standardly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his proceedings against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact of an affected woman was the disappearance of a garden coup in the 1970s.
So, watch out how to break your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is inhealable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn’t focus on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
How many patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take up all that," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long have I been?’
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas holiday.
That's then."
Mesotheliom is particularly harmful because it causes our life conservation mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbest consists of smaller fibers.
When the asbest is ripped up and the fibers are inhaled, they can establish themselves in the breast cell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest feather and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem arises with inhaled asbestos fibers,” says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
Precisely, the hospital by which Andrew Lawson suspects that it exposed him to asbestos is now ironic, a leading center in treating mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of a surgery is controversial.
Some think she is worth an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
“You can’t cut the chest,” he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
In the meantime, the cancer “doesn’t talk very well about chemotherapy,” which “demonstrates the effect,” but doesn’t heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting mesothelium, Abbott came in touch with Andrew Lawson, who had become a single-man support and advisory office for co-affected people four years after diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he showed himself joyfully in calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years ago and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a little more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be re-referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham said.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and need to wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments ultimately fail inevitably, many affected people are from another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realized that a very low burden also represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually announced their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "complete compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelium was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
Following the investigation of his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesotheliom diseases who strive for compensation, it is an enormous problem to allocate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the claimants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislations that make it easier for mesotheliom-affected people to charge compensation even if their previous employers are no longer found.
The law has established a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can demonstrate a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could have given them in a normal damage compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the program are expected annually.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many mesotheliom affected that £350 million represented a “very good job” in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal by insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time hadn't passed and mesothelium diseased find the companies and could normally accuse them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law “is not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, given seven deaths, a quick action is necessary daily.
“People suffer so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After his first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a surgery from which he expected a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40% over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“This is of course the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that makes you go on.
When you give up, you get worse quickly.
Graham Abbott undertook the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flakes around my chest.
I was just 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-end.
Abbott once again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of tumors anymore visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very stressful.
You have to think of practical things - about money when I’m no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
“That’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn’t get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very self-employed and stubborn.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more retarded.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomer sick, such conversations are not through hope, not through a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grievous safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong’s right to government elections, demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament, despite the increasing call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong voters.
This approach probably fires the long-announced protests in the Hong Kong business district, while activists led planning and mobilization to it within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress generally allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
“This doesn’t come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry,” said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That’s not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants elect Government Presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it has a direct voting right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership retains the course firmly in hand through a closely controlled Beijing nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates are to be allowed "with love for land and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicly effective protests in Hong Kong have been held for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to destroy the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general voting right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters were gathered in rain before the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong within a few hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that is to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exploited and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong’s authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and it applied on Sunday before the government building to harden security measures including police forces and barriers.
The trouble is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The addition of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crash under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it threatens the business operation - Hong Kong's lifeshare.
“The protests they talk about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” legal expert Regine Ip, who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We don’t want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported about democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the voting rights, in which 780,000 people participated – more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school balls in the United States is now transferred to universities where freshmen appearances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxurious travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service has a security safety party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise need to compete their assets in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
One company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, added that “students would book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also announced that despite the education fees of £9,000 a year it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as removed.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students.
Many students beginning this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep the strongly rising invoices for the simplest base of life before they can think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. early this month.
The participants raised their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, not shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
While tensions in the Middle West rise and received attention throughout the country, however, Perez saw white women’s answers rotating 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays came relatively late with titles such as "Ferguson's thoughts of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women".
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
“I don’t believe that in feminism many people are talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic for the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to the light problems that black Americans are exposed every day but are not considered "women's topics" in the cultural space.
“I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
If I post something about how colors in their own country are under siege, silence is eager.
"How can it be sure for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public space safety?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women now link the topics of race and gender into the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“In between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white women’s voting law fighters like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for voting law could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to commit themselves to women’s voting law, and the voting law for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why coloured women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the voting right in 1920, it took another decade to organize white women against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created nearly 40 years after the original request for help from sides of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fanging" with the problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
“Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to conceiving control?” asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who build up their career in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to receiving preventive resources now try to understand what it means.
Known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after shooting Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, Guardian’s columnist, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which race as well as gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on race theme in America are still amazed.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "this far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments about Ferguson are unlike their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem in the front of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police raised nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform also comes back to the surface – this time as a women’s topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the topic as an essential women’s topic, she just needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“These talk for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a surroundings in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate makers when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The freestanding house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had asked his head on a sofa.
Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner’s pet.
“However, the photo was wrongly published and now removed,” said a company spokesman.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as "a unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
House sales made interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.

The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who receives nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in drawing the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
But the happy winner has to register.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit was taking care of conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated earnings in the first division last month, a due degree for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had earned a mega win of $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winner pair had played for twenty years and said that the winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas beat to the Gladiatorenae
Not only were the gladiators in the matsh at the first Rheinbacher Roman Day in the recreational park.
However, the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday who defeated the rain shouts and the autumn cold and made them relentlessly enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful rim of representations, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their meaning for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter group of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain pause to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and known presentator and sent his men into the ring each after each for the heroic two-fighting in various gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular sign and short sword, as well as legs on the left leg and rail on the right arm.
Followed the "Essedarii" with a breast shield, short sword and flange, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who started against the "secutor" with a necklace, trizack and dolk, and after a short struggle hit the boy on the ground.
There the swords cracked metallically together, the shields cracked, and the flames flowed surrenderly through the arena that a fear and anxiety could become about the health of the gladiator.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had an ever-attentive eye.
“We wanted to resurvive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable,” explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer “Friendskreis Roman Channel”, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" was found from the amusement park for one day, a Roman city, as the Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings we still admire today.
The remains of these were also amazed at the Roman Day, such as "Aquaduct marble" from the 11 metres high and 1400 metres long Roman channel bridge, which stood at the first time at the Lüfenberg.
The Frontinus company once and now faced the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: “We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then today.”
This also confirms Diploma Engineer Ralph Heiliger from Rheinbach’s “Engineering TeamZwei”, who presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römer villa in Blankenheim presented skits and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as brick stones from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Römer villa.
Impressively, the footprints, left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousands of years ago in the footsteps of sound before burning them.
In 2011, the Memorial Care Office at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Commercial Park North in Rheinbach.
It has been found re-construction walls of an economic building with a darr to dry grains and to beats.
The building probably heard of a Villa Rustica, a farming property, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finding pieces from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
The children also dealt with her with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or, like the Roman students once, wrote their names with metal handles on wax stacks.
At the stand of the Römer thermals Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, built glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and served a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a fleading bread or a musli.
With the original Roman car rebuilt truly by two cold flowers, visitors travelled through the recreational park and also passed the impressive stand of the city gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from September 13 to 21, the Wachtberg municipality will also introduce itself to the Rhineland-proclaimed Roman Year 2014, which was intended to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Verein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, a lecture, cooking evenings and tours for school classes are offered and reminding the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offer a fun teaching hour on international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme in a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans are to be re-experienced at first glance in Wachtberg.
In the Wachtberger City Hall, a small presentation will remind the found of the Berkumer Matronenheilign in 1879.
Ebola: Epidemia burdens West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious impact for the economy.
Markets are wasted - and international companies are going on a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic makes the West African economy a heavy impact.
The harvest is rotted in the fields, the mines are left and the markets are wasted - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already going on a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economical,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on Liberia’s second largest market in Monrovia.
On the market comes only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been most severely hit by the virus, but alone here, more than 600 people were victimized by the fever.
The health agencies recently declared that the disease was emerging in every angle of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands of others were killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group Arcelor Mittal draw off their employees, several international airlines no longer attract the affected regions.
Even local merchants and peasants react: only a few merchants leave their home places to purchase background.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important to export to the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food becomes small
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris’s expert in the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables rather stays home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressingly: food becomes small.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice declines.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with widespread consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are basically avoiding the area over a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore invest,” Hugon warns.
The illness also burdens the state’s strapazable budgets
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the affected states.
The Moody’s rating agency is afraid that their budgets will be heavily suppressed by the high expenditures for the health system and furthermore by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million ($45 million).
The effects are already perceptible in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain home because of fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly declining.
Protectors celebrate her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year-old founding festival will be held from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the Dorfrocker group.
On Saturday, at 18am, the big Böller shooting.
Then the mood evening is in the large festing tent with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle ensures music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9:30 p.m. in the parish church and the large festivity at 14:00 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the prize distribution of the federal and gaul shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndls.
Fest capelle is the Blascapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schuttengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates from 1907, when the association for social entertainment was founded on 21 March by means of exercise in roomstudio and small caliber shooting.
The NS regime led to the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 at Lukas’ hostel lifted up the “new” Schutzverein “Tannenwald” Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult beginning time in which it was mainly about finding an association unit and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein at the "Leininger" guesthouse started with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were organized in seven teams, established themselves in all the classes until the 1st Gauliga.
The club records pursed annually and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the efficiency of active shooters has increased, the numbers of members have evolved positively.
Having no longer sufficient to the demands of a modern shooter association, the Board of Directors under the direction of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new Landgasthof Härteis.
After a work of 2700 hours on May 8, 1988, the pastor Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shelter rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th shooting, associated with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30-year-old founding anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the association members have modernized the spaces and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof last year, thus bringing to the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
It is also possible to see the sports performances of the Schutzverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently involved in the round competitions: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sport gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the District Liga 1 in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (the highest league in Schützengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauoberliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sports, events such as cattle, fascinating and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivities in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart’s return to the race track ended about half away through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tyre broke in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better job and a better outcome for him," Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do it better there.
Stewart already earlier in the race Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch took into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
“I’ve got a good outcome today with pretty good hopes,” said Johnston, adding, “It just didn’t work.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the tracker and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashes race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation of the tragic incident, which led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities on Friday announced that the investigations will last for the cause of the accident at least two weeks.
No decision has been made about whether Stewart has to be charged.
The three-time champion was received with great congratulations when he was presented before the race.
After a launch in the 12th position, Stewart was just afterwards in the first 10 and was temporarily in the fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs fell
Cars with the No. 18 out of control after the output from the curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.

Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk airport
In Eastern Ukraine, the Prorussian fighters are still on the forefront.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank batalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, has abandoned the airport of Rebels Highburg Luhansk.
The army said in the past 24 hours seven soldiers were killed.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the highest army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in wars in the Donetsk region, Russian agencies said on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed that two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard had sinked in the Asov Sea for the first time.
The Ukrainian borderguard confirmed that two of his ships were shot near the port town of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border protectors were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the broadcast 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.

In advance, all stakeholders used their appearances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday, in Brussels, that NATO follows the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of “a crazy breakdown” of the agreement.
“Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and comments from the Russian side, “they consider us as an opponent.”
Stronger NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced to want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A readiness action plan to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations will be launched next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said Monday.
It is still waited for a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute on gas price, Ukraine has no longer received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger broadcast between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe has approximately one-third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says powerword: Toll will come “clear”
Now the Chancellor once again confess it clearly.
But a free letter for all complicated details is not.
Hard-coat concerns from the CDU against the cars have looked at the CSU’s angry.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerword for the introduction of a car hire after continued resistance from her CDU.
"To clearly say that it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said Monday after meetings of the CDU Spitz Engineering in Berlin.
On a detailed model, Merkel didn’t seem.
The black-red government program is called "specific parameters".
Federal Traffic Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has “made a proposal, and it is now being worked on.”
The NRW-CDU, however, continues to pay a toll on all streets.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also constructively engages in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to this, he also talked to Dobrindt about more ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special." Schäuble left a "mirror" report uncommon Sunday, his house examined his own concept to pay highway investors with toll income - after the election 2017.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned from developing toll concepts against the leading minister at the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
“The coalition agreement has never supposed to raise all of the circle and federal roads,” said the president of the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk about the topic again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz associations.
Background are fears that a toll would affect the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had requested loyalty from rows of the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism.
The left views the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," Party Chief Bernd Riexinger told New Osnabrücker Zeitung.
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to launch in 2016.
Domestic car owners cannot be supplemented according to the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll over the car tax.
However, the model cannot disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
A British woman says she thought she was going to die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in belief that she had only a few years to live after having been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and background.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gang and curved toes.
The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51, said: “As a child I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I constantly fell down and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never drive with the other children roll shoes or skateboard and was often hated to go at school because of my way to walk and walk.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to discharge her Achillese seals and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I’d be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and between them slowly lose all my skills.
I made it all alone and planned my own funeral.
She told her when she was 17, she became aware that her skills had not decreased as much as she imagined and interviewed her doctor.
He just stood up, caught me up and said, "My love, I don't think you've got that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a.D. Berni Diether has been working as fireworks since the closing of the former troops’ workspace
For almost ten years, it has no longer been shot at the former troop workplace in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, every month, deadly ammunition still appears in the heart of the biosphere area Schwabische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be exploded on site.
An ear dusting crash happens in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot dropped on the Münsingen troops' exercise place, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares large area is the core piece of the biosphere area Schwäbisch Alb, which is open on 13 paths designated for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and Washington’s companies were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local jobs in the financial year 2013, a 3.8 percent increase compared to 2012’s revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent last year, and it was the third year of growth consecutively after the several years’ declining decisions 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Services Agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax income, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland’s income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax income from companies with 28%.
Most of the increase in tax income is based on a recovery of companies’ real estate values, researchers say, leading to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While a large part of these winnings came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the course seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes are about just over a fifth of companies’ tax revenues.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed only to recovery of the real estate market
Corporate income also seems to be recovered, the data says.
Companies in the region reported income taxes from state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise equally in all three places.
The district’s rise rate corresponded to 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas at 6 percent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25% and in the district is relatively high at 9.975%.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Trade earlier this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate reigns overall than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3 percent.
Meanwhile, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significant faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-defense tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could decline if the Federal Government’s expenditure cut affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city Guangzhou – this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery settled in our city,” said the Vice-Partite Secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
The functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China has always returned to this concern of the twelve-million-metropolis during the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called a canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hesian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he will listen to the project in Germany after a possible partner.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, grain and life pleasure," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This pleasure of life already radiated Mr. Li, he smiled the host.
Then the Guangzhou official met with Shepherd-Gumbel - however with red wine, which was served for dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German brauk art.
Tsingtao beer is braided according to the German purety offer.
More business
A second desire by the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice-Partige Head Li said.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier but deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the municipal politician was convinced.
“The business between our two cities is increasing.”
Currently, travellers would have to take the way over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, presented this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gumbel replied - Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate Germany knower, agreed.
Maintained partnership
Guangzhou’s luxurious vice president hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from the office for allegations of corruption.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is undertaken by Chief of State Xi Jinping with harshness.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to his entry in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis at the Perl River is with its economic power almost as strong as all of Hessen.
Next year, she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "Pushes the Thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she has been introduced to a hospital in New York City three days ago; but her daughter today has shown hopefully that the 81-year-old comic girl is recovered from her disease.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was delivered to Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency heart stop at a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their state, which continues to be described as "earned".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally-friendly vacuum cleaners and increased wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners coming to trade from today, stricter environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners are received on a label from 1 September where the buyer can identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values are applied in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
Furthermore, there is more money for the builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a Twitch acquisition, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion thing, and cooperation appeared natural too.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their brave pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” an insider says.
The Twitch interface.
And "Let's play", a video genre in which betterwise give the (mostly older) playing a painting of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded a little bored, a teaching book example of a established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It’s a puzzle why the deal with YouTube failed to accomplish, as the company reportedly was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they’re rather sporting than watching it, it’s hard to understand the attraction that is expected to watch others when playing instead of taking the control console into the hands of themselves.
It’s one thing to look at a friend over his shoulder at 3 o’clock in the morning as she slides through Resident Evil, and something quite different, to look at a spider as he’s shot in his head 20 times away in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so viewing without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I acknowledge that the quick flows in which Roger Bannisters complete all our electronic age games in record time are entertaining.
But unless there is a game or humor virtuose, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skepticians know like me?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
How exactly does Amazon make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply swallow.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertized as advertisers.
As Twitch Chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as an spectator sport.
On the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest, there was a lot of time on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers voted.
Despite the strong rain custing on Saturday evening, estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Sometimes the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to emit brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was shown early on Sunday evening when the first visitors started open air.
A feast for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supplies on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzwedeler and also guests comfortable from the closer and further environment.
They followed the first live performances, wiped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - shortly: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And this throughout the generations.
While the one on ceilings on the extra-attached white sand on the beach bar, others labbed on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the child's child shocked on the Hüpfburg, which was a great point of attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the child’s child, the volunteers had to do all their hands fully in the true sense of the word to become the andrang lord and to enchant fantasy creations in the small faces.
The Biggers used the kicker table or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew set up from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 a.m. he broke down on the visitors, especially families looking for the width and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not stop this.
“There came more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success throughout the line.”
Therefore, there is no repeat of the major party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked, Sem made clear in a first record on Sunday against the people’s voice.
It was annoying that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too little power.
The consequence: some who had already paid no longer arrived on the ground.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound engineering.
The Salzwedean hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke down her appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre track.
"Next year, however, they're going to be here," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the visitors' numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgiven for the first time, but must be removed in the second edition.
Also on the social network, the organizers have to criticize Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken a little bit of yourself," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so narrow.
I think it’s very good that some are not just stupid, but also really trying to put something on their legs.
Hat away!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now, the organizers will have a year to stop these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shortened
It is not as expected.
Instead, the prepared component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger action: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the cover, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size still remains world record.
The last step towards completing the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper neighborhood of the old cover is removed and removed with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new cover is set up.
If the weather comes with, the action is expected to go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face's bone structure.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully next to it.
A woman was brought into hospital after she shouted so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she turned out the pepper.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cryled so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I was screaming, and while I was doing that, my pine was just standing," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't, the pine was hacked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and laughed almost in the pants, but I had to go to the emergency office.
The 20-year-old girl from the UK was entered into the hospital to drop the pepper again after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull back to a strength?
Lastly, there was always a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereins.
Now the Boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfriends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Castleverein and the castle friend Wolfratshausen.
The views of the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction were very different so far.
The two camps now move towards each other: discussions on a common approach will soon be held.
This is confirmed by the association officers Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could get together once," Sjöberg said.
In his view, all members of the two associations would be able to move back to one strength in the future.
Therefore, visible successes have been achieved faster.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the last time had a rebuilt of the castle at the mountain forest, the castle verein around Sjöberg stands for the "closing and experience" of the ground in front.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castlefriends, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath’s death, he has been present with the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has about 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we first let the association activity rest from respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood image within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident someone will find himself." He himself doesn't want to candidate because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much to continue to work on the project."
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a air lock.
Due to a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is meaningful to advance the project." It can be created a "alone-set feature" for the flower town.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU subsidies, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction I personally don't want to just throw over board." He hoped that the castle club may move somewhat at this point.
Their goal of documenting history initially is “important and good.”
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save at university teaching books
Since the cost of university teaching books for many students was more than $1,000 a year, Fast Second Semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.
He created a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay return sales.
“My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-keks,” Schroeder, 19, told Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college leadership announced that students spend on average more than $1,200 annually on teaching books and study materials, however, there were different options for students to reduce costs.
Online shops and creative approaches like Schroeders are increasingly the choice solution for students.
Renting teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly favourable price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, reported that the rent of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookshops last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in campus books, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price for which you have in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialized teaching book retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t make any of the notes of other or normal traces of use, then used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 Cent on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditures are allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditures can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs for the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rents
Renting teaching books is worth consideration if you treat them somewhat well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please find out about the provisions of the transaction in which you hire, including the penalty fees applicable to writing notes, submissions or traces of use.
Tenant caution: If you don’t return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, "Calculus" can be rented for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teachings can be very expensive.
Absolutely looking around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing in books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before an online order, you should check Gault whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Became No Cash Battle
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" played less than $30 million in his $90 million budget in the U.S. while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" played only $12 million in his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Paralysis Easy Made 2" also disappoint in revenues.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon paralysis easily made 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target audience it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer movie launch shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year on at least 2,000 paintings.
The results are based on the views of movie seekers and movie critics and suggest that this year’s movie hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing sighting habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who currently works on Disney’s soon-appearing jungle book movie, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the current weak cash results of Hollywood production, Netflix recently achieved sales of $1.2 billion streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which the sales was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on the films of comics and prophesising a Hollywood "core melt".
In light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are however more optimistic:
X-Men’s producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cash outcomes as simply “cyclical” and told Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema ever, and nobody will be worried about the business.”
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of stirring the ligue division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence: Those who didn’t climb have decreased.
Although Göttingen’s highest class team has avoided the decline in the Oberliga delegation, it is only fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedo women remain, despite their great march to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserves take place in the new Association League, where no Göttingen clubs are represented.
With the women, the TTV geismar plays in the Associations League, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class of the composition is now the new District Oberliga Süd.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the District League, as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The District Superior League of the Ladies begins at least in the strength of intent.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the match.
In the district liga, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district liga stack of the SCW young people - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two Göttingen Circle Leagues started with nine teams.
In the West Staff are the Red-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staffel plays Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Ladies-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no women’s teams at the circle level.
Remarking that none of the six 2.Circle classes are reaching the intended strength, here the innovative and circumvoiled Circle Board will have to ever think about.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, around 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall there to hold a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has tracked for us the developments on the weekend and talked to demonstrators travelling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teen flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenagers were brought safe with the rope winds after they were captured the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left their tour shortly after Sunday morning at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The concerned relatives called the police at about 20 p.m. when the two weren’t returned home.
A local police and rescue team broke out and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23:00.
The girl had wounded his knee and the man had fallen down and had opened his head.
Rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Government enemy protests escalate in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The broadcaster has retrieved the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said demonstrators equipped with stacks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
Demonstrators call for the resignation of the chief of government to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police said about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday, there were again collisions of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed on weekends and more than 500 were injured when protesters attempted to penetrate Sharif’s residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday after a meeting in the Army headquarters, “to waste without time and to apply without violence.”
It also stated, "The army remains committed to its role to guarantee the security of the state."
The escalating violence has been concerned about an intervention of the military, which has already been more frequently deterred in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri lasted since the Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif rejected a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to persist on Sunday.
“We won’t go back without having forced Sharif to withdraw,” Khan said.
Qadri said itself similarly.
Khan claims Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the Central and Provincial Governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the election system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially persisted peacefully before Parliament, until Khan and Qadri urged them to penetrate Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hüttldorfer after second season victory in the third place of the table.
With the 2:0 about Grödig, a bitter week for Rapid took an end to a reconciliable end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," coach Zoran Barisic said, whose team had reached a deep intermediate in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was unbelievably important," said Captain and Torschutter Steffen Hofmann, who, with green-white, launched in the third place.
Schrammel Dream Gate brings Rapid to the Victor Road Rapid with the second season victory showed the right response to disappointment against Helsinki and goes to the country’s game break with a successful experience.
“We wanted to show a positive reaction,” said foreign defenseman Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley, put the soft to victory from the sixteenth century in the 14th minute.
“I thought I had all the frustration of Thursday and snugged it under the latte,” the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel had met on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a Bundesligapartie, this was still for Ried.
The first championship striker in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
“This is something very special for me, I’m from the rapid childhood,” Schrammel said.
Because of Mario Pavelic’s short-term basin blessure, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there too.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrored.
He deserved the gate, he has already given some assistance today,” Barisic said.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after just an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could also have written.
"Thank God, we've had a little luck today," Schrammel said, who played on the difference of performance and results in recent weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the game was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even thought it had been "in many games better before than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium."
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team’s framework was intact despite the returns: “Today my team has shown that it has a character.”
Not less happy for him: “We finally played too zero again.”
Also, the circumstance that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts will make the victory even more valuable.
“You shouldn’t forget that,” said Barisic, who lost players with Behrendt and Pavelic in the last three days, “who were very stable in recent times.”
Therefore, the country’s gambling pause needs to be used to “leak wounds and put a little bit in the physical area,” said Barisic, who has five U21 choosing players in his rows.
One who is especially located in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks down for the team, goes over pain.
Just in this heavy phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before its change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "You can't believe that everything is good now" "We've certainly had a little luck too, but sometime the luck must come back to us too.
Now it was time,” Hofmann said.
He said, “You can’t always see it black and white.
We haven’t played as bad in recent weeks as it was shown.
We cannot believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They follow me at some stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counterfeit "from the Magic Gate category," as well as the regular gate of Utz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly discovered by arbitrator Kollegger.
The only accusation that the team can make is that we were not concrete enough in some stages towards Gate.
We had too little degrees.
Indoor defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It has just started badly, but then we found purely and even made a gate.
Overall, it would have been more in it.
Under this summit there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle performance of the summer series "My Piece of Röner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the pictured exemplary is the "raids" above underwhite brun.
A hollow walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes through couples, basalt stones and basalt stones seas.
A piece below the stone break of the Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, is there.
Vital looks like the natural memory, it runs beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds an American mammoth tree with a circle of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
In spite of intensive research, however, there were only evidence of the origin of the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked elderly people from Unterweißbrunn to find out what concerns it has with the rubbish.
The result of his research remained the fairly sober explanation for the name.
As a result, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underweight brunette to the hardly rodered and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards exhausted from the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance back, because on the grasslands it is actually goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be given caution, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for crossrotters.
A hiking path leads from underweight brun to the tree, but that is something hidden.
Other paths are indicated, climb towards Highrhön and invite to an extensive hike.
Where is the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is looking for in our next task is rarely to be found at the height.
The mirroring in the grab already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building container could fit.
Where is our "Piece of Röner Happiness"?
My piece of Rhone Happiness
As with the previous Main Post series in recent years, there are also prizes to win again today if they have the right solution.
Those who like to photograph themselves can also participate.
Under the e-mail address red.neustadt@mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your very personal "Piece of Rhone Happiness" under this keyword.

After a week-long drawing, Italy’s Prime Minister and official EU Chairman Matteo Renzi, at the EU Special Summit last week, has enforced the nomination of its Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, and she will be the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government's newspaper La Repubblica reflects, the appeal of his Mogherini in the government team as a favorite as the strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Not lastly, Renzi hopes that even the left party base that is constantly looking forward against him will be repeatedly calm, for Mogherini is assigned – although rather moderately – to this party.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council, Poland Donald Tusk is nominated, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, in order to achieve a political compensation.
Because at the same time, the EU chief diplomat will be a substitute for the Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament’s approval is considered to be secure.
Otherwise President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a “important recognition” of Italy’s role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, known for their ambition, has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades, will demonstrate the "enormal challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the promoted politician in 1996 in the youth organization of the Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined today’s social-democratic PD in 2008 with the Catholic Center Party Margherita.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the election in 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It has occupied traditional focus on Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, known by studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to be his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40% votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD tours, has a share of it.
In Brussels, the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, which is lack of substance, is confessed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s untrustfully realistic accents are being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and diffamed as a “Russian-friendly course”.
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to southern Europe by Russia’s natural gas moving from Ukraine, which is also the service of Italy’s energy assurance.
After Renzi took office as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with resentment, as well as inviting the Kremlin Head to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who previously completed a different education in the company.
In four training professionals, the new employees are working in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedural mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Frei von Sorge, and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended main or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years and the trainees will go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hiking and rafting are on the program.
The company has 435 employees and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and bring France into order," Francois Hollande's main ally said.
Mr. Valls called upon the deeply divided left to show her "love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet transformation has hit against a misconciliation in the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay alongside him,” he said with great applause.
As a relieving gesture, the Prime Minister stressed that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite severe demands for a relocation of the rule of Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economics.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his socialists to show himself to be “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand into the gear, in which she took place at a meeting of abductive socialist deputies and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “belief in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the continual dumping fights of the socialists and said she could not imagine that the new Valls government will sustain for longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new ones will also not survive autumn or winter," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party's reputation after a dissolution of Parliament and said she is confident to emerge as a winner in preliminary elections and is ready for government.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Journal du Dimanche reported that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the Hollands 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government does not improve the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could further worsen.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise service provider in the world, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers, while it is competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said Sunday and warned that the talks could end without any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Private Equity Company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, a 6% increase compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in a total and in the coming years it is expected to be due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied for exchange from the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28% of the shares, Apollo 20% of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a 8% share of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, according to the original application documents for the exchange of Prestige Cruises, have over 82% of passenger capacity at American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A loyal group nearby swings the Chinese flag.
The Constant Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for leadership elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee that is expected to be occupied with loyal members of Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for oppositional Democrats to be approved to the election, and led pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and with "Occupy Central" protests crack down the Hong Kong financial square.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership is afraid that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing white paper in which China’s dominance over Hong Kong was depicted in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and there organized a sit-in.
Lis survey is organized by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Connection Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Affairs Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed over the course of the day.
Student activists announced to meet in the afternoon in front of the headquarters office in Hong Kong.
Until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain had no democratic elements.
Putin calls for Kiev to receive "state talks" with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the Ukrainian government would stop the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state” of the abductive region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become a part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent his rights and interests.
Putin’s call on the government of Kiev to negotiate with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, matches the strategy he had pursued since the outbreaks began five months ago: aid to separatists in accepting territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly-proclaimed region of Novorossija to be a real independence with the Russian.
In an interview with Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annected the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the area taken as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminding the pre-revolutionary shine time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to "be caught in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start immediately in-depth talks, not only about technical issues, but also about the political organization of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskow said Putin’s reference to state in the context of larger autonomy, which has been discussed by the leadership of Kiev for months to scatter fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, Peskov said.
It’s not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it’s not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman on the correction of Putin's "misinterpretation" comments underlined Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct annection of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in annecting the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys from the time before the conflict resulted in a broad majority for the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The five months ago annected peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trade port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castings that make important components for the Russian military.
In his official introduction speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution, to grant the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and rebels are accused of Moscow.
Putin’s last invitation to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the heights of the eye followed another rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tanks entered the Eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the hands, which, according to fears of Ukraine’s security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fix Mariupol, a steel industry harbour with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for acts to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return anymore," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership required the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, probably held by the Russian assault in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian parachute hunters, who had been captured in Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal for Australian Promise and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelste didn't make a hell about his trouble about hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the Hollywood A-Promise.
The movie town is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal about promises on the internet.
The responsible hacker has probably 60 naked photos from Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly also published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The most precious who had engaged with Grecko last month told Confidential, "It's absurd."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and shared to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said, according to a news website, that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker has probably 30 images of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two photos in which she is located at the top without a pool.
Palmer’s film works include “Love is invincible” with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' told TMZ: "It's an awful violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting gecked pictures from a phone is nothing else than the sale of hellerware."
Just legally, the re-distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and hikers attended yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg, supporting the association "Aid for Carcinoma Children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, represented a light training for the others.
In one, however, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life, the head of the Oberschule Brauhaus ride the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily put the little muscle cat away, especially because the participation in the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg for the help of the association "Assistance for Cancer-Sick Children" (Frankfurt) also personally brought a valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
“Now I know I can – great!”
Small pockets on the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, sitting for the CDU in the Upper Curseler City Parliament, many of the 718 participants were tortured to mountains yesterday in the early morning and came close to exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
Others, however, fell easier to overcome the 11 kilometres long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole red green politician from the circle day - red dress, red bike - made something understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there is the goal!") at the start, but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also walked through the trail in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had been on the way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg wheels" was not necessarily an athletic challenge: "Here's charity, we'd like to be with it - we'd have done an exit anywhere today," said Kuhn.
Along the way they had hit Paul Wenzel from Obernberg.
In the morning, the boy (12) went down to the upper class to strap back to the height immediately.
In the morning, the Frankfurter Florian Zierz had switched into the seat at 9am home, "making" the Feldberg twice, then rolling home with fun.
It also had fun "Fritten Toni".
For the chief of the Oberseler Kultkiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are simply involved.
He had spent 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilometer wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm glad to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an “ambitioned racing racer.”
He must also be that, because he was on the road with the Fixie wheel, although they're also racing wheels, but without a circuit...
Not only proved the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who drove a car tire with weights behind himself on a curtain.
Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team with all-wheel-drive Bully and Quad, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, only that he draws the sliding stop himself." So, the man is certainly his own sliding dog.
The 718 participants – and therefore as many as ever before – were sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9:30.
Followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radders on the Great Feldberg", gave the Start Commands and wishes the participants a nice excursion.
For next year, he hopes that he will be able to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
