Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing construction of Israel’s settlements and throws Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
Due to Obama’s deal on the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship of the two has further worsened.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress on the invitation of the Republicans.
The talk was not dealt with Obama, a meeting had rejected him with a reference to the coming election in Israel in his time.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly citing police voice that he shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "good dog" but was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officials found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note that was cracked on a white block: "I'm so sorry I wanted to turn it back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who teached in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school area where he shot and killed a popular history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the harmful emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police boiled him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented, but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal prehistory.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both teached in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a license for health reasons, saying he had any health problems.
This year he only teached two online courses.
The latest changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him for an automatic path towards an employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "there was of course something in Mr. Lamb's presentation."
These are questions that Lamb cannot answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the town of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said they believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and teached geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in teaching in the spring.
One of Lambs’ long-time girlfriends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool elder guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years.
He was the women's worm at the time.
“All girls melt there when he was there,” Hairston said, now 40, and living in the Jackson district of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein house, bordering to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer year market three years ago.
Later they played one or another gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmony game before a petty audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning and shaking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and of the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, around 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a candlelight memorial party.
Schmidt's Ms. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnguard, while the university's scholar "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb called Prentiss as his wife in his emergency call, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centers across the country, while 45,000 workers were hired in the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business approaches, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes for his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat is empty next to me, and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in a trailer for a coming documentary “Back in Time.”
The movie begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated ground and a armlength away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago premiere.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "uncontrolledly the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be watched on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said his response to Russia’s reinforced military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” for the nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Head again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – USA, Russia, China, Britain and France – on the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the dispersions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria, which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to take it seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have destroyed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper range in surveys, it has (not yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump conducting in the two-digit field, and some begin to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was given to rising Herman Cain, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But foreign groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s durability and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not only a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are maintained in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same thing about Trump).
The next about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfaced” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a senior commander last week, according to Quinnipiac.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, ABC/Post says.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When they set up their scholars, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten placed their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it is shown that a variety of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even when the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still hits almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump has earned majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overcome the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change this, and no one can really say to never change his mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s strongest competition is at the moment the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as common to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his electoral campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rape," immigration was a rotary and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on issues of immigration.
So as long as the immigration remains in the ramplight, Donald Trump will seem to do it too.
The frustration over the government has risen to new levels.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now removed by about half of the support of Republican voters, especially due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are angry on Washington too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "holely angry."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: Germany’s five most exclusive residential areas
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reet roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
“The offering of objects is limited to Sylt, naturally,” the study says – therefore, the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student bud in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top residential places, one of the prices comes like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices in shining heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, commonly.
But well, who can afford...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of this place.
Champions League: Bayern dream launch thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-way gate sniper in Piraeus: Bavarian star Thomas Müller has just a race.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller took the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then run's.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream launch in the "Milan Mission" in the Piraeus Witch Box.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their start match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hits (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth launch in series will be the first step towards the finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to take the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, Müller received kindness with the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a shot of the world champion happen as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised 31,688 hot-blooded fans before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium, and the Munich people kept the word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but often uninventedly to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were incurred too often by game movement to Douglas Costa, which rarely came through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Muller was more lucky from the right than his flanks hit from the right half field in the upper left Toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos assault Ideye Brown hit the Poland's headball from the line (26th).
Then by direct decrease, Gatewart Roberto paid with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to play dominant games, Piraeus could put needle sticks.
Manuel Neuer was reliable to the guardians.
So when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
Before Newer, Guardiola left a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the chad, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero didn’t give green light until the final training, Sports Board Matthias Sammer said at “Sky”: “Whoever wants to make something else from it is already malicious.”
Even at the first change Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by elfmeter Müller put one more on it.
Before the game, it came to Krawallen at the stadium.
After a smaller group of Bavarian fans in their viewer block apparently had provoked host Piraeus’ followers with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and hit the Munich’s followers.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news: If you don’t, the risk is decreasing quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is based on the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and gum inflammation, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this parodontitis, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the connection between smoking and tooth loss leads to more frequent gum inflammations in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take over ten years until the danger drops back to the level of non-smoking, the first author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham said.
It has to be convinced people to become non-smoking, research director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said: “Smoking shortens lifetime.”
No smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous investigations had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underlines the findings.
Archaeologists meet Cologne's Rheinufers on remains from the late
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made in Cologne on the right Rhineland.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeleton and remains of historical buildings, museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground memorials.
At all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always attracted as a specialist office for archaeological soil memory care.
In the third construction section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now named.
From text documents, it was already known that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured from goods train
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has fallen out, the Federal Police asks the people to help them.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the slide from the direction of the railway building at the end of the railway station and was captured by a goods train that came from the direction of Monchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, the train seized the most serious injuries.
She was noticed on site and brought to a hospital by rescue officers.
The reason for the nightly rail crossing of the young woman is not available to the investigating officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or inhabitants have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passengers from Linderner Bahn, Brick Bakerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leifarther Straße (L364) come in question.
Notices that indicate the cause of the accident can be provided at the 24-hour hotline of the Federal Police at phone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute about TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to much more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said.
The Sweden plans to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings provide specifically for EU and the US to jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They are equally coming from the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow them to oppose judgments.
Until now, the prosecutors agreed with each other on arbitrators, there was no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, Malmström commented that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice.
In terms of long term, it is intended to work to an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese enterprises and EU countries could be addressed.
The mainly required investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, which enterprises can dispute taxpayers’ compensation, lift national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first comments, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
It has been criticized above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission considers essential issues in the reform that Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European corporate association BusinessEurope warned not to restrict the economy’s opportunities for complaint through too many new rules.
This could be particularly disadvantaged by small and medium-sized enterprises, it said.
When the discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded on Wednesday, it remained unclear.
The negotiations have been launching since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States so far.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be already at the end of this year.
This date is considered no longer durable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Alongside him is a flipchart on which the shameful acting folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with filt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven’s lecture.
He tells about several places he always records on the map, which he reports about his carefully arranged and tenderly arranged songs.
Where they grew up and how it looks there, in their homeland.
Since then, Stevens proves to be a wonderful creative crazy.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, smartly composed songs appear to be harmoniously close to the American people of the late sixties, but can drive into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor emerges that "Michigan" would be the first part of a waged series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be singed consecutively.
However, since 2004 and near Rhein, “Seven Swans” has already appeared and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduced Stevens occurs here.
Live enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel The Illinoise"), a fully celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overwhelming to ideas and stylish finesses.
The album goes into the American Billboard Charts and lacks in no annual top list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic replacement pieces.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and hall.
As long as you have escaped the smaller clubs, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacle of neon steering tapes and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring as part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark Hamburger More!
Theatre is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now banned in their chairs, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear that the lecture is "more opulent" and thereby you can throw the "plate basically away".
Only for an addition thanks Stevens modestly, plays a few older songs acousticly, and eventually bows himself under tough applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debuts at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut is expected with excitement at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn will debut at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour, and will take up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise up to ask the first of his six predicted questions shortly after midnight, with his performance probably being reviewed by the media and the Labour members from nearby.
He called for "fewer theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, as it comes to a member of the Shadow Cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC year meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national hymn singing at a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provocating criticism from a number of Tory MPs, and is at the center of several title page story in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn draws attention
A spokesman by Mr. Corbyn said he had "stayed in respectful silence" and recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn, “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr. Corbyn’s top team, and they have called for differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leaders.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "stacked" within Labour, according to Mr. Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of winnings.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that Labour would make amendments to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pension Minister said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he was tory chief, stands across the dispatch box in parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised a different political approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s questioning hour is too confronting, and that he will be deprived of both “slackability” and the disputes with rebels, and has instead planned to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of economics, will be represented by him if he does not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is on abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word, and that he addressed John Bercow, the spokesman of the Under House, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "Casper theater" which is often linked to the Prime Minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
As it was first sent on television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the underhouse and his position among his colleagues of parliament, although critics argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.

Pounds rise by accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose in the leap according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom’s wage growth, parallel to this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, the United Kingdom’s results increased by 2.9% without bonuses compared to the same period of previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage was the fastest and most assessed estimates of the time of interest increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% to $1.5505 compared to the dollar and rose to $1.3730 to 0.84% compared to the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase by 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offer of the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest brewery companies in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the Richemont competition for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales numbers suffer all expectations and also showed that revenue in China - a key market for Burberry - returns to growth.
Glencore’s shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said he took $2.5 billion through an equity sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s packaging and paper company shares were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had put his estimate for the company’s rating on “selling”.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax score of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are threatening the expansion.
JD Sports Managing Director Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher work costs of its company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years old, a hanfling with upright hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Even more.
Currently Mr. Bieber is in Berlin.
The U17 generation turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the polin sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Building: Here she lives her idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs the day as much as her mom Ewa earns in the half of the year.
If anyway.
She says, "Really my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnastics."
"I'll fulfill her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's jucked?
Not the fans.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He was worried anyway.
For the claims in the advertising pause of the Superbowl, he caught three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars to the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and over the shop table, Bieber also casses.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're stunned on the window.
He was supposed to have more than 100 million so exploited.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the U.S. and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on rank 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not interested in many zeros.
At least he does that.
Pegida-Placat brings Lebanese to potato done idea
Potatoes or tones?
It’s both the potato done, which Oldenburg’s owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Potato rather than Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay Potato and meat put together on a spout.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartoffles instead of Döner", which he had seen randomly on television.
Since then, in his shop, a barbecue spindle has been equipped with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculture for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now entered the patent office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes of the spout contains, Alhay doesn’t say.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of peoples comes well with its customers as well.
Metcash launches soil stability campaign to fight Aldi accident
Metcash attempts to protect the IGA from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food Wholesale Metcash has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia before a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events as Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesale of food, alcohol and equipment is conducting its annual investor strategy day.
South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that after twelve months of the opening of their first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analytics Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose sales $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and earn a revenue of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food shops and Metcash’s high fixed costs could cost about $13 million profit from interest and tax, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley said Metcash’s sales in food and food shops will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while pressing on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale retains and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive director Ian Morrice says price adjustments and shop sanctioning programs will be added to Elan and hoped that the wholesale will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves rather praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into light by the famous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fire-fired qualification match in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, with Harrison called, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he crushed a tennis racket after a cramp defeated a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was standingly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup half-final against Britain.
“One thing I am pretty mature about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi has been a little in the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost because of a crack in the US opens, but he is not the first player who broke a racket from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US opens, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is trained hard, he is good in form, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own earnings.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important prejudice that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for everyone, but he secures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component.
"First, we wish the team is fully focused on competition and not all the controversy around," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has quickly achieved the ascent of what people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is climbing in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him the consequences of his action best understanding, and I think it's.
European refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illegally to the country with the aim of stoping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-nation and Serbian officials responded with revolt.
The people who fled from violence stood for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, migrants scandaled "Open the border!" and cried offences against the Hungarian police.
Some refused from protest food and water.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister said it was “inacceptable” that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Turbulences at the Hungarian-Serb border arrived one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on joint immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, next month or until the end of the year, an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would accept further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency state in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to address the crisis so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum proceedings.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in the meantime that his country also plans to build a steel wire edge along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has ended a close on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the stack wire range between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a substantial pathway for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most coming economic refugees are seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protect - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, are a crime to cross the border or damage to the 4 meters (13 feet) high edge that the government has made to build along the southern border with Serbia.
“Because of the situation arising from mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state,” Government spokesman Zoltan Kovac’s reporters in the southern city of Szeged said.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border transition is a crime.
Parliament must still agree with the military’s operation, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities had captured 45 people attempting to cross the border, while 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police detention and are accused of committing offences according to the new laws.
The authorities are working to repair the wall quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with stack wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the most important border transition near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a crowd to get in there.
About 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advancing Bernie Sanders halves in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit forward in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground against her.
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidating for the presidential office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the pre-election start, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders gained some wins.
Clinton holds a huge advantage in women and moderates, but these advantages have decreased.
Their support with the men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is just five points down here.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has displaced, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
But Clinton has a huge advantage among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit front in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point front in this group.
Approximately half of the democratic voters in the pre-election state that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15% would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton’s current supporters are mostly excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48% of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say they are enthusiasticly supporting Clinton, less Republican voters say that over their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by thinking that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Agreement to address the problems and the electivity are also quoted.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the Waagshale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although one-third believes he shouldn’t do it.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s followers say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton’s advancing rises from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election; however, this number of 78% has fallen last month.
Biden has a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that views it as the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is most important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about elecability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections is unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results on some important features among voters of their party’s pre-elections.
Majority view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden best cuts off in honesty with the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about him.
Democratic voters of the pre-election generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion by Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still asked during the term as foreign minister, most Democratic voters of the pre-election are satisfied with her statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one-third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy did not have any impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions of Clinton were still worsening.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters: only 32 percent see them honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not think they are a honest and trusted person.
At the same time, 55% of voters across the country also view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump are going to get good ratings in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off in honesty.
A majority looks like Sanders rather than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson goes behind Donald Trump in a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is in the latest survey by CBS News/New York Times narrow behind Donald Trump
In the meantime, half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country, with support growing by 23% in the last CBS survey, which was carried out before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the survey from Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson goes well with demographic groups and Trump exceeds among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin’s Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - he lands with 19% support to the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
In view of a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hearing for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologised for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Nice bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Although peak values are measured only remotely, it is enough for bathing holidays to find a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water.
A bathroom in the northern or Baltic sea may be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic sea it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a scorching ritual of a student’s conference in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, death thanksgivings are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency call number 911 after Deng became acknowledged and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to switch Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood president to gather advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At that point, the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Deng,” police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died from his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added injuries to the head, rubbish, and thighs with stump force.
“Too many families have been destroyed by the shikans of the Brotherhood; at least one student dies from the shikans every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury from Monroe recommended an accusation of third-grade murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of scary attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We are not only going to make the involved persons responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also account for them," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates.
An interest increase will come, and the houses will fall, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history offers little guidance to the business.
A recession came within only 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond.
Therefore, U.S. Central Bank representatives have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the entire excitement may have been overwhelmed due to an interest increase.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘billed money’,” said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. rates to normal heights, but still to too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a tendency that asset income will be deprived 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," German bank analysts said in a newer study on what happens after interest increases in the Fed.
More specifically, the market is usually upward in the last 35 years - about 14% - on the way to interest increase, quite flat in the 250 days later (average profit of 2.6%), then returned to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six investment cycles of 14.4% at Bob's management rate, according to a current doll analysis.
The Deutsche Bank said the impact on shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is remarkable in this regard that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest increase in the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic scene could be risky, raising the question, "if this time it's different," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have raised interest in the Fed all year round, and all the eyes were directed to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading only gives a 25% chance.
“In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing GDP vibration and pre-recession heights have been shaded very quickly after the beginning of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months to date.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market predicts a rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In bonds, returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increasing cycle, the bond-lending statements will fall immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattering of the curve.
High-rate bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields,” Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones says the markets have already adapted to Fed strategic expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit rates have expanded, and volatility has risen - all the features of the market when the Fed increases its strategy.
Overall, companies that run the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from rising interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products.
Multinational corporations with high debt will be worse as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and financing their debt.
“History shows that ‘Quality’ shares tend to respond too positively three months after an initial rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital revenues and low volatility in their shares also overcome their penders with low quality by an average of 4 (percent) and 3 (percent) points each.
The debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars.
Savings could see profits through higher revenues, even if experts are of different opinions of how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, Parliament member Andrew Bingham says
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcast for his "deduction"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they were imitating only The Brits.
Parliament college Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that it wasn’t very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he does something that the private broadcasters don't do.
Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio station was "verdume" and increasingly no longer distinguishing from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dizzling" - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something else – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you actually only mimic what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC CEO rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and public enlightenment.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unbeatable.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and ordering new works, I also think it’s really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needs to work harder on engaging the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that went under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of Culture, Media and Sports for pushing the commercial rivals.
Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall stressed that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on special BBC wise."
He added, he wishes the company to "find a hit from our own home stall" when it starts a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude ordering other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from fees paid for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday has burned spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditures for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000, with only five percent increases compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent of growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and drop until 2000, then this has always evolved over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is going on, and we may see that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decreasing sales.
Experts believe that buyers retain their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers shared around their computers to make their businesses, and some dealer websites dropped.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for business, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £5 spending was spent a little more than £1 online.
Some products such as television and washing machines are now done by more than one-third of purchases via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion chains in the city centers.
Muslims buried the killed in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
Bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia burdens the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane at Mecca's Great Mosque was decayed.
Mourning, largely dressed in white, filled the path to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning process passed through the Holy Place, where only days earlier a construction crane dropped through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the beteners.
The bodies were released for the funeral, when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the construction company of the family Bin Laden because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beters who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane went down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already strongly promised that the Hadsch will continue to Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin-Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said the management of the company was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Early this week, Salman pledged to reveal what caused the crane’s fall, which fell into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadsch, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also accused the group of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is undertaking larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an abductive son who was denied by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stayed in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) should be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured people receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of another 200 Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales sites across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chef Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Brits put their hamers and brushes down in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the works in their homes.
If you can handle a hammer or a brush for walls, you appear to be a minority today.
Because Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction markets chain, said that a huge increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at lowest prices has now been overcome.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops for craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales sites.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q-Shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men prevail with the employees.
She said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It's still working a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consists of women with 80% of decisions about purchasing items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also transformed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and revenues after the group shaped the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Workers of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob have been responsible for infidelity and tax removal.
The accused did not recognize guilty.
One of them was also accused of official abuse.
This charge was legitimately released in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Senior Attorney Robert Riffel, in the pre-examination, it was clear that the accused used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 of funding from association accounts on which they were allowed to provide in their functions.
The damage is calculated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
This fact expelled the chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is intended to be negotiated at a later time.
In the assault of the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had no disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials had only charged compensations for efforts and the sports club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money, led out of the debt - the passives were about 600,000 Schilling in 2001 ($44,000).
“At that time we stood in front of the situation: Do we continue to lead the club or do we lock it?” one of the accused, in the bread occupation major auditors of the Finance Office.
With his colleague and co-prosecutor he then decided to take this task.
With all risks.
“We have fired money, put our life insurances as a security at the bank,” he said.
The club has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it cannot be made any debt.
Furthermore, in the event of such financial success, the repayment of the compensation was retroactively decided until 1991.
Therefore, some of the compensations were paid only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, package and not detail bookings also appeared, the former Obmann explained the operations.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association, the judge asked.
The association did not have a detailed interest in financial development, it was important to only be freedom of debt, the answer says.
In 2011, when a functional investigation began on official abuse, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
These were records, the accused explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent knew no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he thought this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-prosecutor was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "hazardous returning goods".
Why did the judge and prosecutor want to know?
Then the first accused said he did not agree with this wording because the association had never caused any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the Schneider?"
“Are I a legal representative?” he asked.
Furthermore, the employee said he never received a cent salary, he just calculated kilometers and diets.
He invoiced the club on diets 1,000 euros a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The accused could not present accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an operational test in which everything was judged as correct, they explained.
The second accused had also been for kilometres of money.
All fixes were made in cash and he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard reachs more than 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year-old staff decrease, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the splitting of the company.
U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) does not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology company plans to decrease from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its customers’ department.
This aims to save costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion euros), the company said on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will occur from the fourth quarter.
The decrease of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP employed some 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard share was 2.3 percent.
The large-scale printer company from the Californian Palo Alto is currently dividing itself: the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company – separately from the more powerful future areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services.
Both business parties should be noted on the exchange.
A re-disappointing PC revenue and a weaker demand for corporate customers for their services increased the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, sales of PCs and printers declined by 11.5%.
Sales dropped by 8% to almost $25.4 billion.
The revenues returned in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a breakdown and massive jobs to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more shops online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans are expected to decrease around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Education Mission
The direct participation of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq would, however, mostly reject: 54 per cent claimed to be agreed, 35 per cent agreed to be agreed.
Other countries fly air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria find 61% positive.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51% of respondents, 20% would be for it.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
At the center of the trade fair are networked, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
According to two press releases, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automotive Exhibition under the motto "Connect Mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA on Saturday.
The VDA car organizations are expecting about 900 000 visitors, just like two years ago.
Röszczke: violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used several hundred refugees at the Serbian border at Röszke’s tear gas and watersmiths.
Euronews corespondent Dániel Bozsik has seen the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind the police officer and a water threwer was ready behind the police officer.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, stones and plastic bottles according to the officials.
The officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Afterwards, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the area.
Children who breathe the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees were sacked together and suffered from breathing impairment.
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Notebank
The world observes when the U.S. Notebank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey under 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was believed last week that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and the interest rates will keep at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historical event because it has been seven years since the Fed placed interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, lead employee at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rose perspective of global conditions.
She has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 a.m. on Thursday
Death assault at Delta State University left excuse letter
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before killing his colleague later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it "does sorry" in the first murder and wanted to "he could make it bad," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff at the emergency call center that the police must send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that "a sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller about his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note by Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally took his own life on Monday evening as police surrounding him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "there was of course something in Mr. Lamb's presentation."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was “no information, no evidence” for a “triangle relationship.”
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter that was 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He doesn't go into prison."
As police brought him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University, as his living law indicates on the university’s website.
Stars who lost their happiness
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had a few stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor has also allegedly fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All that surely calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the company
The Lufthansa plans a large group rebuilding.
A half a billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1,000 leaders worldwide will cost the workplace for the company’s redevelopment.
Nevertheless, with the pilot union there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and values the cheap daughters of Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute around 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer be board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings airline should be developed as self-developed as possible.
At the CEO team for Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
Spohr emphasizes the importance of Eurowings, with which the company will in the future engage against Ryanair and Easyjet.
To date, the organization of the 120,000 strong employees was complex.
The airlines signed under the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual sales of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations will be launched again on Thursday after the stopped court strike.
This is what the trade union said.
The subject of the discussions is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in a year with a forecast recording result" as quickly as possible.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
Background is the savings concept "Wings" in addition to the transitional supply of pilots.
It is expected that the Lufthansa expand the Eurowings low-cost line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League delay at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal doesn’t leave the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by an unconscious attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw went into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before being brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, he's got very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the dressing box.
He cryed.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very worse attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank all of you for your messages. Words can't describe how I'm broken, my way to recovery begins now, I'm going back more."
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, they’re all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in another direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
In talking to SBS6 Moreno said, “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it, so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won’t take a long time until you know it almost outside.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite childhood book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Delightful, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it seems to always give a picture or message that we have missed so far."
Everything beautiful and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the act of the book, instead reflects an indication of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the surrounded town of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature has gone and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, fully fulfilled her desire to see a real tree," you read.
As if this wasn’t suspected enough: the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax movie, presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: “In the surrounded city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a good, hopes the boy named Ted, the Heart of Audrey.
Although he acknowledges to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here a unnamed boy hears the local environment dropped by the money-desired trees, thneed striking Once-ler is destroyed despite the protests of the name-naming Lorax.
It was most likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax 20 times along a child.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text was probably coming from Cameron's electoral circle office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s employees, but gave no further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still difficult.
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the coach that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series lower situation is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outside victory.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, just a youth-positive setting.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, it is an option for the attack.
Then related message: Adam Lyth is removed from the England test chamber and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is of course hard to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are aimed at results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, where - and I said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
If he runs out for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn’t achieve so good, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s especially a team man.
The question of how much time a test slagger gets to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth gained seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton gained nine.
Only Compton gained the chance to play home and away.
The only charge to be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in the highest form – but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitman I'm highly worthwhile.
He is a X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 places against us on a Trent Bridge, which met us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him, but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin boomer and get four quicks, appeared, and I didn’t have anything about it.
I don't see why a striker can't beat there, and this left handman has already shown that he's a devil guy of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the chad as a back-up speaker, and in my limited deal with him he impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his statistics - on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a point, but there is no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer stab.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the most nice guys of the game, who will bring a lot of experience, as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup.
I’ve always felt he’s created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has insights we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dress cabin even if the messages are in line with the previously spoken.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made light heart.
Brexit warehouse (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain outbreak if the economy falls into a flaw by 2017
David Cameron’s unexpected renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to be deeper in trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which heavily breaks down for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend said recently that some member states, as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is now and not always of their own fault, are tired of Britain's agenda itself with divided concessions and disturbing contract changes that they usually don't want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it doesn’t like it either if it threatens social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes Britain that looks outside inside the EU center - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and let us see that more and more brief ministers and officials have come to the point where they do not matter whether we stay or go.
Germany's prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad to her, as has happened with the long-persevered such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a devastating force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to get rid of a leg to help the selfie Britain whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan to not helpful comments, completely in the SNP style, while Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pleat" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how robbery the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skepticians is the oligarchy of the press baron, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Arz Euro opportunists who made a name as a Brussels “EU-Gerade Bananas” correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing shots, phone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-International, who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that when you sit in a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming at his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum, because Blair had put the principle on the unauthorized constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly flap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he no longer needs time to waste for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development - I am pretty friendly on it.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside of Ukips’ traditional trend to rush aarbox and the wilder landscapes of Tory’s small Englishism may be able to say yes.
It is what Hilary "A Benn but not a Bennite" Benn said on the radio and television this week when the pathfinder fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocating John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father was trying to be unloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary’s struggle was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and members after all reports at their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever Corbyn’s stirring bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV 24/7 and above all in the strudel of social media, a site of paranoia and betrayment.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for a clear, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic multi-definition of EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion under left dissidents, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be committed to try to find a sense for their supervisors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrust voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be all meaningless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in costs of the Tory government on power, which I was remembered at the launch on Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-cigarettes
State-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the Lancet Medical Journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called for to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose managing director previously had received British American Tobacco Fund (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said he would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was supposed to have received from Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for choosing members of the board are not delivered, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco guidance of PHE also participated in the meeting.
The group’s research work “is significantly” that there is a lack of “hard evidence of the damage of most products at most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence that e-cigarettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking.”
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims have been reacted before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Each second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 chief says
Channel 4 former chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard-disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he has tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidiated rivals,” Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee what I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should be produced at least on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a top-class window because they want to achieve as wide assistance as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course foolish.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admitted to both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I’m trying to see how this should be public television.
I don’t think this would decrease the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC blame for hunting reviews is “because the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.”
His comments on BBC’s most popular broadcasting return to what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4 where you cannot measure the audience pretty much, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their holy missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value of this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that is true because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
Former head of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also announced before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reitian mission, "to inform, to form and to entertain."
He said little of the BBC’s production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its television production and 0.1% on radio – and it should take an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into “informate, explain, and entertain.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in fields like the proms, of which he said that only a handful is shown on television, and enter alliances with the commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by sound waves eruptions.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motoneurone cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of its motorcycle-eurones carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbubbles and transferred into the worms where they turn on the altered motoneurones.
The procedure has some similarities to optogenetics, a basic tool that allows scientists to turn and turn off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages to this technique.
Unlike light that has to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired spot in the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves can pass unhinderedly and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-produced cells, he added.

Advertisements Shame UK Weapon Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Arms watch trade fair video.
Horrorful killer drones!
Foot joint breaking leg chains!
Streubumbombs!
And electric shock bars that cause tormental pain, but don't leave a track!
The joyful voice and cartoon pictures do not doubt that this display for the world’s largest weapons trade fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to ramp the British government’s willingness to arms on repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and underground trains and that require a second look.
"Vital announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the DLR trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a shackle of weapons dealers will be driving with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade fair.
The 300 posters are issued by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound package of inbus keys claiming that "access to about one-third of bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this "Vandalism" poster funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and professor at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists go to work with activists within protest movements and note that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plates greet the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works non-profitly with the graphics artist and voiceover artist who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence that ruled around the advertising of the weapons trade fair - through an empty office of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, twittery company advertising, but "that by blowing with bright colours and animation it remains more attached."
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us sharpen awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not being traded illegally in front of our home door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors disrupt fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those whom I angry - and the numerous long breathtaking complaints about others.
Most of the things I learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student residences ranges from slightly nervous rising to absolutely scary.
Tell people where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand with regard to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite doesn't love or hate because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelids were burned and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night events and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and manage their underwear.
Then related: Don’t think of starting with a relationship at the university
Introverts receive gross treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a companion of society is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of clicking.
About clocking: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship by baking.
As you start the university at the highest point of the back-mania, the cracking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you a little. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer homemade tastes is a good way to make friendships.
Your co-inhabitants feel committed to conversation and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed clumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to stand asleep when you blow.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, chicken cloving is a theft, but is it to take a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check it with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my companion who added a sink to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the proverb.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it's a bit of them to put Drum & Bass a little silent, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded to it with even more true music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., she friendly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she made her own music clothes, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly enter the same student home?
Conversely, it wouldn’t be deeply embarrassing if you consider a companion for your future spouse, get away with her, get separated again, and then have to see her every day, and perhaps see how she translates all the common friends to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your underboom a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it takes only moments to become bumerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and fun lesson about safety - but never suck anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door, and put her keys into a glass of water, which you then put into the freezer - but not more than twice tackle their possessions on the ceiling.
Houses for refugees, single parents, lesser earnings
Property contractor Markus Gildner builds houses in the Middle-French corner valley for people who don’t have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living room, but also the only educating mother and the lesser earner."
“I’m showing how to build good today,” the 44-year-old says in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pressing to the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable living space can be created: he builds houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pressing to the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people remain a large part here.
In the face of the refugee flow, we also need enough living space in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-floor row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
This is different if you place people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living area per house is €184,000, without plot.
That's overviewable.
Six months took the construction.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: As a result, I passed my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening damocle sword special construction and the place regulation.
Grusely.
It is still undertaken that who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is no place for it.
Refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents respond to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely wrong.
But don’t you sharpen the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but have been built luxury apartments that hardly one can afford more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living room.
Not only refugees, but also the mother alone, or the lesser earner.
I show how to build inexpensive and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get The New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they received an error message that reports that the "software update has failed".
To address the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slowing up the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half away and this could lead to a termination of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one currency in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the launch in the seven crucial overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore."
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve seasonal races and is also taking the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence Singapore’s Great Prize is still unclear.
For days a dune cloak is dependent on the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The three months ago founded chess club "Friende Bad Kissingen" has joined another member in its ranks, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who lived for cure in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the Federal Merit Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be advanced.
Gauselmann wishes membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" as an expression of its connection with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saúdis and the Old Center Antonistift joined under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, on the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
There was recently opened a new quarter office.
Here, immediately next to the shopping market, seniors and advisors will now receive information on questions such as the insurance or services of the health and nursing cash.
For years, with our ambulant care, we have noticed that often nursing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
“Not rarely many of the cash’s benefits are not used because the complexity of the insurances is hardly or understood,” explained Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonipice and the citizens’ hospital as well as the ambulant service “Amadeus”.
In addition to the discussions, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as drop prevention, memory training, or physioterapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saúdis are ideally complemented.
Saúdis stands for prevention, precaution and rehabilitation.
“The Senior Center for Care and Care,” said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saúdis.
The reason for the opening of the new quartier office in the city centre is that both executives see particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) in the opening celebrations, the quartier office also devotes itself to the unions at age: “There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite them to a regular partnership.”
This makes the Social Foundation a great contribution that seniors can live independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The quartier office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 14pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16am to 18am and Saturdays from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: after the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-lingual Würzburger Kickers has not yet been set for rehabilitation at the Fuchspark Stadium, October 6 has now been set as a date.
The encounter of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayern Football Totopocal against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally terminated.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19am at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
“We are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning safety,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched card sale.
It’s special for our team to play against a third-party group.
Therefore, we hope on numerous viewers, and not without reason, because flood light games have a special enthusiasm.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg took place in 2010 by winning the district liste 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional liste 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-party league decreaser SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist’s house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang the artist’s house lost an honorary member and at the same time “one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna”, as it was called in the exhibition.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983, he was president of the Austrian Institute of Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to establish the Treasury Chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and to rebuild Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese announced police officer with money
Former footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
Football player was once, now Tim Wiese, a former national guardian in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, he didn’t reach.
Wiese was just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremer when he saw a parking guard outside issued a penalty note for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the fine in front of her feet, as the "Picture" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but it is not clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
“The thing is still in the examination,” Bremen said.
Only afterwards, it will be decided whether or not we will be displayed.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants

For three days, Panama’s authorities have ripped off the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men strike 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, at around 23.45 a.m., three young men walked from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men screamed to the young people and struck him in his face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nose break and bleeded heavily from his nose.
When his two friends hurried and calmingly invited the racket, he initially left his sacrifice.
The wounded young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to its apartment and passed demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
He was again attacked by the racket and another male person.
With a help of a crack, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for the purpose of medical care.
So far, there is only a vague perpetrator description.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters in height.
The second racket was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and indicators to contact telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felsentehausen.
Mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Mayor Heinfried Kabbert of Asendorf are also excited about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country, but Asendorf is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felsentehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felsentehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich stands half alongside his successor in the next few months.
After a remodeling phase, Müller opens the practice again on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the Felsentehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training at the Verden Hospital and will also enter into practice next year.
“We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felsentehausen and laughs.
“When it was, I just called her.”
The couple of Müller liked the idea of performing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to meet and accompany families over the years.”
It is also an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so we agreed that the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, two-family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices, as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently he works as a Superior Physician in Sulingen, in 2009 he was appointed as a Senior Notar in the Diepholz District and voluntarily engaged in the DRK’s readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
As of September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new chief.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felsentehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to reside as doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out therefore," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic surveys as well as long-term and load ECGs and need more a speech room.
Furthermore, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of 50000 euros is granted by Müllers as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) and from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," says Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen each quarter, in the Northern German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another housekeeping practice.
A positive side effect of the practice overtake by Frank Müller: the pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felsentehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have gone too.
Anyone who visits Müller’s speech hours continues to look primarily in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning force from the Felstehausen.
With their farewell in Asendorf, an era ends, after all, doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felsentehausen.
She feels a little beautiful after a long time.
“But we’re still living in Hohenmoor and we’ll see many patients often,” the Internist says.
Her husband laughed, "We have a 6000-square-meter ground piece."
“I’ve always pressed myself ahead of gardenwork, now that could be different.”
The couple also enjoys two grandchildren and travels.
Croatia: “We leave refugees through”
“Now border controls are also rising at our southern border,” said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it "self-evident".
The supply and safety of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Korridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to leave refugees coming towards Austria and Germany and may also build corridors for the refugees.
However, the Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenian does not want to remove its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his commitments, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already attempted to enter East Croatia past the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid to avoid registration during Tuesday night hours.
The Croatian police were able to grab her in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles and new refugees are constantly meeting in Croatian Tovarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is expecting about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serb border, which so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade contends that it is to instruct people to pick up certain routes: "We can neither, nor will we do this."
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early morning, while further buses were expected throughout the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The prisoners had been traveling throughout the night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away, through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has opened up, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could now actually come to the displacement of the previous Balkan-Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia Hungary to a slightly further western route previously predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong stream of refugees.
He did not call details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Shengen member has "comprehensive opportunities for border control".
Rigorous controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have been a good testimony to the country since then regarding the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, behind the Hungarian border range, around 300 refugees are still detained.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at Horgos border crossing, leading to Röszke.
According to Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday early at a local eyelight in Horgos: he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not currently be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War, which is still unwavered.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent to the border region.
Exchange Hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is supposed to have heard of a ring of cybercriminals accused of continuously gaining an insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information obtained, insider businesses have been made in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, over $100 million were regained in total.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally captured,” the SEC report said.
The proceedings against another 32 accused in the case lasted.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are supposed to have acted from both the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz runs rural operations.
People do their cares, partly fast steps, partly cozyly bumpling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer car salon at the parade square.
Hold city railways.
Pulsing, magnificent life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large boards each with the title "Before I want to die".
The Ecumenical Hospice Assistance made this action attention to its 20-year-old existence and faces completely mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we’ve gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passenger as well for questions and conversations as the volunteer employees.
While some passenger spontaneously grabs to the crude and the sentence about "bear my life", "can read", "with the camper drive through the US", "stop war" or "not long suffering", others stand short, read, say phrases "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Repeatedly, small discussions on the edge develop about the action in itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only if I make myself clear that the end of this world comes at some point, I can live responsibly,” says the director of the Diaconical Work Mannheim, who is a carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance, together with the Caritas Association.
Therefore, this public-effective action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, ultimately it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and death is still stacked with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospice movement has helped people open up in recent years.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the first hour volunteers.
Through personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance was looking for volunteers by calling, she immediately signed up and was at the founding of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers – 43 women and two men – accompanied by those affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and at the Hospice Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences experienced in it.
“I see the life of another waiting, consider it to be precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenical Hospice Service is free and confidential.
Financial support for health insurance and donations from family members and associations enables training, as well as training and supervisions of the death and grief companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx outcome mixed, lowered financial outlook for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced his profit outlook on a year round due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share dropped over 2.5% in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said earning a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey from FactSet.
The lower prospects come despite price increases, which are 4.9% on average and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher soil transportation supplements of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November.
The company said it nevertheless expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “provides solid revenue when considering the weakest than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workforce, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than last year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.
Sales rose by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has declined in the international priority shipment in recent years, which has led to stagn sales in its express shipment unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport rose by 29 percent, but the operational outcome was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the outcome dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
On its most expected meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategies spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it’s time to raise the rate for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall is a wall picture of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests in front of all other things.
The Central Bank has a twofold order by Congress: maximizing US employment and prices keep stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate might be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. On Thursday, it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to start to be decontracted from the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economy data show that it grows solid, the recent turbulence in the global financial markets could cause the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds – and even just by a quarter percentage.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are watching,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economy officer at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which insecures the financial market in itself.
About half of the economists recently asked by Bloomberg have predicted an interest increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect an awaiting of the Fed, with a key indicator that only shows a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategy mitigates the blow by promising that further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economy at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time,” he said.
If she does, "you should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't fall in panic."
Other experts argued that an interest increase would soothe financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Still a month ago, the Fed seemed in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow sharpness of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed this year, she expected an increase in the sentence.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement on the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although the inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
“The economy can manage higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world together at the end of last month after China devaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average in May fell by more than 16% below its highest level when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dross global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the highest of May.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when interest rates should be increased.
“If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks, they would appeal to this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Notebank employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait for at least a month to get the effects better managed.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But ultimately, the Fed Currency Authority has become the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "extend" its monetary expansion caused confusions around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly connected to each other, Fed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to advise with other central banks and experts to gain better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that “the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to the economic fundamental data.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de committed to an interest increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives repeated these cuts.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market breakdown in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest settlement committee.
The recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation in which she's afraid of an interest increase because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not believe it should precede time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, he is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/the warehouse is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to walk through the corridors.
If the entire shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garden kitchen (good and cheap) in this shop is located near the cash and has various carrying options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably.
Products are affordable and a number of them is sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The meat shelter is extensive, as well as the fish shelter - the staff behind the shelter will clean the fish and filter and even brake for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and gall, pig-natural bowels, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys one here: restaurant owners and chefs, including individual families and individuals.
The wide passages are suitable for shopping cart and forklifts.

Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even though the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Assistance for Refugees
More and more refugees come in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome will not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a whole number of people who support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She is still happy to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker home on Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German language.
Of course, this is quite different lessons than at a right school.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS attempts to shockingly explain women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
Bernried approved the construction application for the costly €2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flatter for solar systems.
The plans for the long-awaited gym building at the Bernrieder Sports Area come step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the designed construction application was unanimously declared without great discussions.
Previously, the Board had decided, among other things, on an application for a legal "exception" respecting "release" from the applicable plan of construction.
The "exception" was concerned with the permission of a special form regarding roof construction.
Therefore, a “satellite dash with non-middle first and roof overlay” is to be built.
Background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar facilities: "This means that we get a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "release" was on the other hand about the roof inclination, which is to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike what is required in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
Therefore, a "release" was needed because the plan of construction concerning the roof inclination does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bernrieder municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively with requests for release.
However, gym building is not a recurring project: “We do not create a precedent,” says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
At the cost of approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated.
Subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and breadth sports.
In the next process step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Land Council Office for testing.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned, namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, which confirmed Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board, and it will be held on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans are implemented, then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing Inner Station.
The rooms are present.
Jochner-Weiß says, “Employees who can’t get to Schongau are to offer a job in Weilheim.”
Employees are informed of the plans.
Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Hongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now moved to a private practice near the hospital.
On the question of who to succeed, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the match, which declared ready to take over the leadership from 1 October and switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this meant, in any case, a "revaluation" and a widening of the offer in the field of "Inner Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemaker and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees to conduct both houses, Fischer and his team will be finally closed in Peissenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation is completed at Weilheim Hospital.
Landrattin Jochner-Weiss, also chairman of the Supervisory Board, came up with rumours that the house in the possession of the Federal Cappage will be used as a housing for asylum tissues in the future.
"I don't." As it continues with the property, Jochner-White couldn't say there are several thoughts.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity is not coming again," said Fischer on the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was accepted "positively and very comprehensively" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years, has not been there.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (alone 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closing over the past few decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The Rhine-Neckar Lions handballers are called for tonight at the Bergisch HC.
Although the Bundesliga's guide is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is none of the occasion for excellence.
In the past season, the swimmers had a painful defeat at the BHC and have to do something well there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abertens on a corn field in Pratau (Wittenberg Landkreis), several hunters were in use, police said.
After a shot tax, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could happen was unclear at first.
The criminal police determined.
Missing 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Pfalz victims of violence crimes
One suspect has led the police to the corpse of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Pfalz since Saturday.
The 20-year-old agreed to kill the young people and throw their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A missing 16-year-old girl from Rheinland-Pfalz has been victimized by a violent crime since Saturday.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as police and prosecutor office reported on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old also arrested on Tuesday night, who said the act was suspected and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on early evening after visiting an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first hit the personal objects of the victim.
In surveys in the Friends and Knowledge Circle of the Missing, the 20-year-old eventually suspected the act.
The alleged criminal then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detainee, according to the authorities, admitted in the police investigation that the 16-year-old had killed and placed the corpse in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented on Wednesday to the prisoner, the investigators put him to the burden of killing.
Explore the closer circumstances of the act is to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns of home gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a cost-effective residence.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are calling on a market that has already been overloaded in many major cities.
You compete with weak income citizens about the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units should be built every year by 2020.
This results a study on behalf of the association "Social Wohnungsgebäude".
For comparison, this year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
Therefore, there are 140,000 apartments missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first reception accommodation.
Many then enter the apartment market and grade into the long snakes before the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also exhibits significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing a deficit of housing, which is increasing from year to year.
Currently, some 770,000 residential units lacked in the municipalities, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in major cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults stayed unwillingly in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaut on the home market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "social home building" alliance suggests a restart.
New incentives are to reinforce social housing.
Thus, the basic tax could be renounced and the basic tax for funded homes could be temporarily exposed.
According to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are also needed.
The program for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is now well-coming in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch on Monday evening, with 184 million euros, more than half of the available around 300 million euros was already received.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free travel: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, it is practically no longer possible, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the crossing to the north of Slovenia without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to talk with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the settlement of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people came across the border in Tovarnik, reports Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees last day.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let refugees happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, “You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility.”
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia with Croatia.
Most media reports reported from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and taxes to the Serbian border town Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to walk through the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not meet borders.
For this, the border strip poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining cleaners are now expected to create a safe passage quickly.
After Hungary, after the closure of the border, there are hardly more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people attacked.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws stage overcoming and damaging the border zone as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Szeged.
The convicted threatens prison sentence up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established transit zones at the border, almost all of which were the most important transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were more than 40 refugees.
However, practically no one has an outlook to obtain asylum in Hungary.
Serbia is a “secure third country”.
The refused asylum seekers are to be dismissed there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszczke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning them.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside over the past few weeks.
Lock grids were demolished and one of the receiving bearings in the border location was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak for the purpose of this renovation.
After the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees are reached.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About the 20,000 migrants still stayed in the country according to government reports.
In Salzburg, approximately 1400 people are waiting for further journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drives "strapped" over the border
“We were working with cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel bags stood at the door of the tent,” said Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to get to Passau by train.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped the traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was in Wernstein for them," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and heated the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to Near Passau.
Earlier, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with soap and drinks.
We said we'll take them to Passau by car.
“This was of course for us,” Stadler said in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefighter.
“That’s really pleased us,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to announce that train traffic to Germany was stopped in the short-term, but still to try over the border.
However, the regional train was shut down in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridgefest associated with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, on the days before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us more than thirty thousands is a logical outcome of a holy policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszcze camp in building structures that ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has highly officially and publicly pushed the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dust circle of Nazism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the “predicted country” that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
In view of the ongoing refugee flows and the nearby winter, it will be a big challenge to create decent states for protectors.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for 35,000 winter-fest quarters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bank to establish quartiers for thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the Traiskirchen First Reception Center has already taken control of Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen,” he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without a large vertebrate, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis situation.”
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fulfil the number, 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks – 20,000 are expected to provide the countries, 15,000 the alliance.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a fat without ground,” Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the heads of the country.
They would have allowed him to create neighborhoods for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will be explained how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help Like Us".
On the platform, individuals can offer accommodation easily.
It is also hoped for hotels empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as “very high”.
In emergency times, it cannot be that quarterholders must comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
“Not-standards” should apply for a temporary period of time.
Contrary to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, he founded his experience.
I am an older lord to whom one does not say falsehood in the face.
Conviction is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maiers do not cause the Republic any costs, as they explained themselves.
Your number of employees want to increase to three to four.
Their own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as a office.
However, there are apparently problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
No opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the persons concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, Mayor Klaus Luger (SP) says.
For the emergency, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief exerts criticism in the distribution of refugees within the federal country.
Other districts also have to contribute here.
Seehofer: “The boundaries are not locked off”
In a longer phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, state head Josef Pühringer (VP) addressed further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked off.
The continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are currently the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available.
However, protectors would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Other EU member states once again called for strengthening solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is for Pühringer a “logic consequence” of the German action.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Ship" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the exchange-noted IT group S&T is taken, the remainder (2700 square meters) is intended to be rented to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we need to try to work for us," says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the new shipyard and later acquiring them.
Already from the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors – of which Niederhauser promises a lot: “The next Runtastic is just a matter of time.”
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the Upper Austria country and the Bund (FFG).
The building is paid to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years by Linz AG.
30% of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40% there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the Arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are at the center.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to allow a dog.
This project had to move 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni shortly in the Pigeon Market Arcade: Finally, she has now grown in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop towards the shop, where it sells, among other things, pockets, shoes and clothes of various manufacturers, everything is now turning around the brand's Furla handbags, wallets are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
“But I have long thought about whether to open a shop,” says Breit.
Essential for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also appealed to the idea of a location where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the big area of Linz who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has broadened her mother into the wig.
It’s worth me most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get in disgust when they look at a beautiful handbag, either the specialist cannot answer with last safety.
Perhaps it's because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
Donald Trump’s ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called an employer.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for anxieties.
Whether he is expressed by xenophobia, reporters dealt with boldness or reveals lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office strongly urges the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also registered in the Pfalsian Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with fresh frisure is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is related to it over -seven corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral campaign mode.
Call town girl Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but they're not so deeply impressed in their kind of Callstadt either," says Simone Wendel.
The native Call Town girl has shot a funny documentary about the place and its famous splash, among which, besides Trump, also counts the ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, not known for modestness, also comes to word in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of the hearts there.
Although there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to think that Trump “is a little bit a big maul,” Wendel says.
Randomly, the spitzname that Kallstadt has in the surrounding area, "Die Brulljesmacher" sounds to high-deutsch: the householders, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the managers.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a local for gold graves in the US.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first properties purchase in New York.
However, the life of the grandparents was not free of tragic: their desire to return to home for a long time failed in the Bavarian state to which the pavement belonged at the time.
He didn’t accept Trump because he once went off without permission, the director of the Institute of False History and People’s Custody, Roland Paul, declared a film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal migrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly denied speaking about Mexican immigrants to the US and called for the construction of a border wall to dismiss illegal immigrants.
“As the politers, it’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative of Trump (“The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandmother was born Heinz”).
The pensioned wineman sees the American rather distant, "he's always so overwhelming."
Do you think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
“He has never taken care of Kallstadt.”
Pension manager Veronika Schramm mentioned as some of Kallstadters that a descendant of the family Heinz donated something for the church-norgel during a visit, which came generally well.
“I can’t imagine that about Donald,” the 68-year-old said.
She would find it better if he doesn’t have the choice, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the saying in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, “If he would never have arrived there.”
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says wine daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
“My president is not,” she says.
“The grapes are ripe even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 filmmakers, even in the U.S. the interest awakens.
The upper Bavarian municipality Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the vice-president of the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurried to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it did not have great shifts in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Army Days, was in London as part of a weekly series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today, 339,000.
Today has achieved a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers at 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morningmen more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recent widowed father, who decided to sit with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafter's star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, returned on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour reached 720,000.
Average hot seat 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia’s second evening quotas will be nine to vote confidently that hot seats will end up at 17:30 a.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overflow the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery reveals?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknown who wins the Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped in the biggest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one that received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons on the day before getting from three, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood holds his lips firmly sealed until the final Thursday
All three women have lyricically left off why Wood is the perfect man, calling their sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game destroyer who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible, and I thought of it throughout the show," Jeaben-Fellows said.
“Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it’s so fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
Mackay told her that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the one".
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreserved to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a distinction between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30 a.m., on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah the first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent requests after their impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a gerangle as the Aussie Rugby League converted at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the running game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabinet after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
49ers’ sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his passionate catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne has a point recovered in the first game district by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the launch Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playground after the fumble and later told Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
“That was a thing that’s going on now, you only care about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with arms force.
After openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, seized his oil company Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
Free voters call for 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt from a serious crisis at Bayern schools if there are no new teachers accordingly for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtags fraction of Free voters meets until Friday in the sub-French municipality.
In fact, there were completely different main topics.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overlap the clausur," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria, as it occurred during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s.
"So it's not going on, we have to do with the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Denied asylum seekers want to displace free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal countries are not consistent: “We needed federally uniform standards of the federal countries.”
"Bayern displaces, others don't."
“We have to become more capable of acting.”
However, the country’s policy in Grand Wall City is not going to fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: educational policy.
For the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnastics launched the pilot attempt "Middle Level plus" in which a renewal of the gymnastics middle level is tested from three to four years - then it takes nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
"The G9 topic must be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasies who want to do so.
Free drive to the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber shots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, one official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Leading District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators were gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before taking up rubber shots.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shots, known that they can kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern levels, where members of the Madhesi’s ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disputes since 10.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city currently prepares everything for the marketing of the 4000-square meters.
Planned is a mixture of trade, trade and living - concrete offers are not yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Alte Post Youth Center.
The preparations for this are currently ongoing.
It is planned to use the ground for a mixture of trade, trade and residence.
We are waiting for appropriate offers, it says by the city.
Which investor comes into question is not clear yet.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The town of Emden had a part of the plot located on the Ringstraße / Corner Large street, bought already a few months ago and left the building on it to rip away.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the small sea at Emden take shape.
The investor first introduced publicly plans for the project.
Some leaves are still worried - they are afraid of sale out of their leisure refuge
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, greeted, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement near the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Building", presented its plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening at the Emder Council's City Development Committee.
This issue had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group who prepared the investors and the administration of secret-creation, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the system-building business management: "We have not yet a response to all questions," he told the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it’s good to meet all rumors now.
The expensive project of about 10 to 12 million euros has been discussed for months.
Heavy reactions among sea bud owners who had entered the meeting expressed the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the Seabuden and member of the Board of Directors of the Stakeholders, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant clot that exceeds all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like some other project critics, that the traffic due to the plant’s intended size would increase strongly: “There must be all bus loads so that it is expected,” Schulz said.
However, what happens exactly on the well a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a conclusive concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the plans are still variable.
Twin girls at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have young people with their gorillas.
26-year-old Dian born twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian holds her closely on the body until now.
First, the "picture" was reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted a wide deep-pressure system of about 350 miles south of the southern Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical turbulent storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google launches double-giving campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O.) announced a duplication donation campaign to spend $11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees overrolled the European nations as they escape from torn and empowered countries from the war.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
“Our journey included many dark trains and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family desperately seek help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: physicians without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to 5.5 million on google.com/refugee to $11 million.
Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also escaped from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It’s still too early to tell whether overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgery treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s own ability to take food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been carried out in people who are diseasedly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with an BMI over 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, in 36%, diabetes was completely dissolved and in part in 28%.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes solved completely only at one percent compared with diabetes and in part only at about two percent.
Furthermore, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best held below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not decrease mortality in five years, leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues says.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and rather complete overcome of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study that heavier people in Sweden leads to longer surgery life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in people who were obesity-abused, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with an IMC under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because she says that this surgery in this lower BMI group is lower,” she said without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI lies between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we make people take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult.”
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly attentive in belletrics: a young woman, unpopular and inconscious at school times, meets after years the worm of her youth, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Really we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The main professional author grew up in Boring Weiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to end the violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies.
He requested that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasized that, although the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts in addressing the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
“To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush’s action after the September 11 terrorist attack and revealed that the U.S. violent reaction moved a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in taking hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfection agents, the Georgia Poison Center said.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant revenue in children under the age of 12, reporting poison control centers, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them goes to the emergency,” Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfection agents while some do it to impress their friends or due to a courageous sample on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwater to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be shocked by attractive fragrances of the disinfectant.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectant) are those perfumed.
There are disinfection agents with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City, said.
So, you wouldn't let whisky go around, but people let these hand disinfection agents in the reach of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhajah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently had taken four syringes of the fragrant hand disinfectant in school, was brought to an emergency hospital for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhajah launched her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency office.
Doctors watched them overnight at a separate childhood hospital on signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
“This was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhajah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection towels and store hand disinfection agents outside the child’s reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfection agents containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of healthcare agencies suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active agent.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison her “common” teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banned her out of her room.
The police considered the dismissed plan as a "speech" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in an accident on the cross-section between the Northern Ring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross slope towards circular industrial area and saw too late that two vehicles had stopped ahead of the circular.
As a result, he moved with his truck into the back of an Audi and shot this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta standing ahead of it.
The vehicles involved in accidents were damaged by approximately 10,000 euros, the police reported.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be drawn.
Rumous kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops to be in a bad place, but he will turn it again.
Hearts will be fighting SFA for accusation of Neilson and cautiously fighting Warburton for January-new commitments that could destroy the unit of the chader
Dons Increase Celtic Guidance to Five Points
ADAM Rooney's elfmeter in the first half time, Aberdeen gave a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, making the Dons create a five-point gap between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down discourse about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffith, which insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bore Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax ambassador, said, "In Holland they don't show highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, swear Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things back.
After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat of 10 men from Aberdeen, which now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had previously bad times, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel exactly that, but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
To stand together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which suggested that he focused on some January transfers, Rangers Boss Mark Warburton is careful in signing new accesses and maintains that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox chader.
Brentford’s former chief said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
Players coming in summer have this pre-season time to integrate with what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea attacker Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, has suggested that he could withdraw if his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plaguing with a boring ankle for two years and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set on SFA slaughter because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the defender was later revoked - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said, and continues to say, "I haven't questioned integrity, I haven't commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The unbeatable Hibee was rebuckled after he admitted to singing a song with stumbling texts about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a Roseburn pub in Edinburgh before a Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the stormer said, adding, "it is sure to say I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has Trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly continues to make sure Dundee United’s Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things on - but he acknowledges that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has trust in us.
We're going to bring the guys back to trab," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton “unfortunately.”
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his crew from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that entered them a forefront of five points before Celtic at the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elfmeter in the first half time.
McInnes said, “There’s no team that won everything in cup games or ligues that didn’t even win games like that.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period of May to July at 164,000, while the number of people without work in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate was 5.9% above the UK’s unemployment rate of 5.5%, according to the numbers of the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,610,000.
Employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% during the quarter, a number above the UK average of 73.5%.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, “The government’s long-term plan has put the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It’s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.

Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than places available, a macaber lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips' closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship with phone calls over the months and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “ could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to discuss all the details here again.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I surely believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact.
What you will get from me is to see a man dying an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police hunting persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale Policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man’s attempt to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the sea and sumptuous water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried “to gently persuade him to return to the shore.”
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house breakdown incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he addressed a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do fun things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins rode his car into the dives to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims Stewards tried to spy him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stalls last year and threatened to immediately end the race.
He aimed at Racing Victoria’s Stewards and Integrity Department and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching for a racing day treatment, the last straw halm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media he has always tried to do what is best for the racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt trial at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had retained 18 months because of the spionage accusations and didn’t want it to “seem like too highly hanging grapes.”
“I had to say nothing about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it was going on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around the lifted head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
In an interview with racing.com, Moody had made the bomb up that the Integrity Department had tried to espionate his stall.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man – whom I’m going to name when asked – and offered him a job in my stalls to provide information about what I’m doing within my stalls,” Moody said at Racing.com.
They apparently believe I'm a scammer.
If that is the case, they should certainly trust their noses because they failed when trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Chief Executive Officer of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that bring me to the view that it becomes personal?
Did the RVL behave fairy and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I'm.
Perhaps they have to take my license and breach me, and I have no doubt that what I say will let them think about it now.
But now I arrived at the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and Late Scratching led to he’s saying he could throw his license over the table.
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse legs, which dismissed against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been the way yesterday all day, whatever was.
So was it on the race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the race day.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you’re going too far,” Moody said.
Man Arrested to Driver Refuge
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver refuge in Cobram.
The biker was entered into the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued to stop to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia policeman arrived in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged with driver refuge and removed assistance and other traffic crimes.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Returns Rivals for Ring Fighting
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the tackling of his players as "agenda setting" by two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster’s trainer Trent Robinson said the arbitrators allowed the storm players “ring fights” with his team during the high storm victory at the qualification final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a barely covered note on the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he called the game a "sample example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said they were only focused on their "contact" while tacking.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team is confident to him because it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That's going to come up again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when she beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has made the trend shift for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he has obviously had a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, so it was a little shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting his game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence on because they say these things because they are a little worried to have to play against us.
She didn’t think about us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also noted that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game schedules.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team will be free this weekend as they won the right to either receive North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-final in AAMI Park. Ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 Deposit After Drug Accusation
A man who might threaten a lifelong punishment because of his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine trafficked to Queensland was released for a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and placed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-prosecutors at the yacht port during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that at the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he declared to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic’s mother and steep father had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security jointly to achieve his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of the two people, it is clear that paying a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, joins the police daily and holds an outlet lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident at A5 in Karlsruhe: Leader House breaks apart
In a riding accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had burned in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape left at the last moment, as police said.
The accident causer's driver's house broke completely apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital severely injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 o’clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone when he slept, enrolled in an online message service from which he received a series of unanimous pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found on the address and discovered “related” web research that used terms for finding inappropriate pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he did it because he would lead it to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "he claimed to be a policeman to scare them."
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a dependency - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
"When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the inconsistent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared itself guilty in the sense of the accusation of taking inadequate pictures of children on June 14th last year, violating the requirements on January 25th of this year and not appearing in court at a hearing on March 24th of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg to not appear in the registry of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" is found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed the ruling by October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was awarded deposit in this case, but was held in detention of investigation due to hearing on other cases still outstanding.
Before the date of the judgment, he was included in the directory of sexual criminals.
Slutters move out on small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many slushers left people increasingly on smaller border crossings because they were afraid of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
Throughout the border flow, more than 1,000 refugees have been raised in the districts of Passau and Rottal since Tuesday.
They walked through bridges and storage rifles to the German side.
There they are received by federal police officers and redirected to registration.
At Munich’s main railway station, according to Federal Police-Information, more refugees arrived again compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Only by 8:00 a.m. roughly 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Expected Tropenstorm "Henry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn from storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, hot sea air currently flows into the country, the Deutsche Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the league of the Trope Storm "Henry", which in recent days has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic Ocean.
Heavy storms and storms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday’s spring, in the Black Forest, in the Schwabian Alb and in the Bodensee Circle, Böen is expected to be from 60 to 90 kilometers of hours.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years, the car builders on the IAA show their news.
In 2015, there is a particular movement with the compact cars that are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly demanded: about 28.1% of new licenses, according to the KBA, alone in August, were on this segment.
This is also reflected on the IAA (September 17-27) public days.
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the trade fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra is not expected to be much more expensive.
Opel has an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only a five-door.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combo, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what is still going on on new compact cars besides the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault will send the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the trade fair, Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and highlighted sporty GT version.
It comes to trade early next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan-Ableger wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, a diesel is also available at 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer.
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but is renewed around the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën deflector laid mainly on the front part: Here the cooler grill was re-drawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, reduced the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple’s CarPlay.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, are joined at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has rightly given an ex-prisoner of the judicial executive institution Tegel, who had been accommodated for months in a too small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, inmates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published Wednesday.
The persons concerned can, according to the judges, hope for money even if they were locked in a few days in the too narrow rooms (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed at the Berlin-Tegel Justice Executive Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor surface; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on the foot again, was moved into a larger cell.
His lawsuit of liability for the unworthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional judges revoked the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case there for the re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Although for legal reasons of the period in question, only a few days of detention for compensation, a compensation claim was given, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "a denial of the personality's legal protection".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation.
In the past, the Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners.
In April, a prisoner was damaged because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy for humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an indignant accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant was housed in a cell similar to Karlsruhe’s case for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours.
Berlin’s prisons have come to the headlines in recent weeks even because of the lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are repeatedly held 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even fighting it is supposed to have already happened because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press station, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of childhood, 19 are to be dropped away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We'll make it"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the forecast of the Federal Ministry of Interior, Germany is even able to accept a million refugees, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create this, and we can create it."
What is happening in Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (annual estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (annual estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250,000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental properties: annually 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these particularly favourable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
The Pestel Institute’s views are too little: 80,000 social housings would have to be created annually and the Federal would have to invest 6.4 billion a year for this.
Scientists and Federal Building Minister agree that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany were not even systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, appreciation in host society, but also for self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: the ban on work for refugees to recognize work.
While there was previously a work ban for asylum seekers from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers were limited to a residence site.
In society, even due to the lack of professional workers, mostly understood the view that refugees should be enabled to access the labour market faster.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is no sufficient range of general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks, according to Thränhardt, is therefore the royal path to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fleeed parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the unrained parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
Nevertheless, to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handlets in different languages.
If the need for educators increases strongly through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more specialty schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for classes without German knowledge in welcome classes.
They are not always teached by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no deficiency in them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal asylum seekers or patients prohibited the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could facilitate access to university.
Because refugees with a residence allowance or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Requirer Performance Act when they begin a study.
These latter, in principle, do not get a bafög because they do not fall under the circle of the bafög authorized persons.
Patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years until now to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range was shortened to 15 months.
However, this financial gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing State-Church law should further develop to a new State-Religious Ratio.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and give it certain control opportunities.
This also includes the willingness to deal with religious fundamentalism.
Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to exaggerate such conflicts in Germany "have their right to stay here in Germany immediately lost," he said in the Bavarian radio station.
He suggested translation of the basic law in Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a short decade an anti-discrimination agency and a General Equality Act.
However, it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and stakeholders of non-white Germans have long been demanding and what international agreements like the Anti-Racism Convention of Germany commit, must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities – for the benefit of all.
Germany is generally able to provide medically with the expected refugees, doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery said.
"As for man-power and capacity, we create that," he told the daypiece.
However, additional money needs to flow into the system.
In order to avoid depletion, Montgomery demands to deliver health cards to all arrivals at the same time when registering.
Provided services could later be charged with the federal countries.
In the long term, it is very doubtful that so many people have to eat with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seekers’ performance law provides.
Otherwise, doctors primarily create language barriers.
Even so far, Berlin’s health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants are informed about their diseases worse than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but in medical practices, interpreting costs should be taken, she asks.
Many refugees would be helped, however, with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulance.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disability among refugee children, and young people are about HIV education.
However, with the other partly disease images, German doctors were clear from their education, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infection or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as for the lack of physicians, the refugees may even be in view of relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed educational system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps re-examination.
At least half of refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who has a post-traumatic stress disorder, among others, suffers from so-called flashbacks with breath impairment, dizziness, heart grass, and death anguish.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong terribility and emotional dizziness.
To prevent symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, only four percent of psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, doctors or doctors who are not trained for psychological illnesses would generally decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misunderstandings, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new scenario "Suffering" the Circus Probst attacks the traditions of circus arts.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressures and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Suffering" - under this motto is the current manegenization.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
The gift to enthusiasts is in the blood of the family.
“It’s important to us to take people away from their everyday road and take them to a world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegen cocktail with Weltstadt-Flair," director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The Circus program convinces talented artists from around the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the stumbling films, it wants to record the Cuban duo locker.
Ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humour art on the mast is to conquer women’s hearts in the storm.
Except for numerous salmons, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the in-wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpents fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
“The animals belong to our family,” emphasizes Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circumstances are only too often topics in various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also says, “If it’s not good for our animals, it’s not good for us either.”
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stitching unit.
The "four-foot artists", as they are called lovingly, will, if possible, be read by every desire from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t want to get into the magnet.
The highest commandment is, therefore, good care for the animals.
Specially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a shetlandPonyhengst and a zebrastude, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a shelter and nothing happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” says Brigitte Probst.
Although the zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There may be something for every visitor.
“One thing is safe,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether five or 1,200 viewers, we always do our best and we are there with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites every day to its ideas from September 17th to 20th at 17th and 20th.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 6 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 17:00 the prices are reduced.
Furthermore, the animal view is open daily from 10 to 18 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also suffered by claims by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned from accompaniing Mr. Mugabe's talk with Buhrufen.
Last month, they had excused him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament – this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned from disrupting Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title ‘Death’,” he told journalists after Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that Parliament's immunity ends, and as soon as it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "worry" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will decrease up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will later split into two exchange-noted companies this year, and the computer and printer business will separate from its faster growing corporate hardware and service business.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, to lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better set up than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual sales and “will be focused on providing unreached integrated technology solutions for companies to date,” a company statement said.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical facilities and whose Palo Alto garage was called "Silicon Valley's birthplace".
HP has gone through massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s action, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before playing against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of his story his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had closed strongly the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old vibration during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankle or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger is also recognized, there is the danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different Wilshere diseases since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from a injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will take a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a small break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo was also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 measured on the Richterscale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the club with his management to his first European Cup triumph.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men’s friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up now has become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide drawings among young men on a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of man's, with the aim of challenging the culture, prevents men from seek help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece of struggle to manage this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first so that friendship can work.
In the era of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediateness of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy luck.
The beautiful thing with Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Every character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined by the interaction as a friend.
Joey’s and Chandler’s humor frequently coats, moments of football watching in cozy chairs and Ross’ desire for Rachel – all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often refrain from exploring their feelings completely.
As an employee of the phone care explained, “My listening role for people who feel depressive and are at risk of suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old word “I’m coming to deal with” has an enormous effect, how the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes into my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned scene to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what the difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG break Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass through Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of her Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but then missed a number of opportunities before finally raising her lead when Cavani achieved a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only strive to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also to improve the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later changed in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, to cause trouble to our opponents and to relax back, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, though I am sorry that we didn’t achieve another one or two goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes after his injury, which on the weekend was able to keep a 2:2 decision in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was thrown out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinian wing stormer was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he went into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed beautifully through Johan Wiland’s long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, came to Anpiff with nine national players on the field and ran a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's foosters in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes abandoned, with some misleading and poor degrees, not least by Ibrahimovic, who pasted in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his co-players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a spinning shot that was joined by Wiland in the 52th minute by the post ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani, and the Uruguayan won his sixth seasonal gate after Ibrahimovic fished a left flange from Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ezekiel Lavezzi was opened a gate at the end.
Malmö’s coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league that does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat away from Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling raw material prices, gathered $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt removal plan.
The company registered in London Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to repay its own debt.
The company that lost 57% of its market value this year fights with low raw material prices as China’s economic decline presses demand and devastates markets.
The issue of reference rights introduced Glencores stock rate in trade early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange.
The share dropped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pens on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $30 billion debts.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pens per share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on the closure price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest coming is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official to Washington, will take place on September 25 and President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state diner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will give the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral topics of common interest, while also President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to constructively address areas of disputes," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before he continues to travel to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a series of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding alleged cyberspionage in China and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to fulfil a dream and loaned a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
With a company in Gotha County, you can fulfil the dream and once lend and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was also done by a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was then out and past.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, dropped into the wet road and drove into the guide plank.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switching to FC Bayern in 2008
World Championship and European Championship Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago before the commitment of Spain’s Superstar Xavi, who played at the time for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champions - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old now left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
In an interview with the Marca, however, Xavi now announced that he was before the 2008 EM before his farewell from Barcelona.
“They told me that Barça was going to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything at the time, we didn’t,” he says.
It was also registered by the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change.
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
“Pep told me I wouldn’t change, he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
That's why he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 games would have run with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-final of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance on the grass, switched the red (4:0, 1:1) and eventually celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon Plays Diversity in Filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night sequence of HBOs Project Greenlight interrupted the experienced actor Brown, when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s elected script.
“When we talk about diversity, then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with offended unbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian were consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined producers colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the Harmony figure," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a bitch beaten by her white container.
The producer of Dear White People set up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directors of the film; Damon replied that their directors could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before misunderstanding Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's so white that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media stands at the top of the social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved countrywide effect and urged legislators and authorities to make discriminatory practices against colour stops.
In February, the singer Prince made an appointment to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced to be on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope, it is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' Crowns First Champion
Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, never had experienced a competition participant that could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to the final.
The last task belonged to climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete who completed American Ninja Warrior's exhausting phase 4, but Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds faster, making him winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-fighted victory, still under shock over the winning of the big prize of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about that I’ve never earned or had more than $10,000 to live,” Isaac E! said about his money.
So suddenly... as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, the one gets it with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's getting any angry about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He received mass awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If someone should be struck me, then I'm glad that it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shootings will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Slides Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season wasn’t particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Earlier they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, however, this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within one half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter what it comes," Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support, when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It’s hard to throw in the bullet every game, and therefore I want to enter the game fully concentrated.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He's swing the wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at the (schlag training), looked much better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to come back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left handman Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surpassed the Wall, the only man he was confronted, before the designated Rookie Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who rescued a two-run from the right handman Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Hahagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was the 27th leading in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a Double Play.
After Detroit adding an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, a RBI wall doubled against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stacked Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right hand veteran, which had been deleted from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff battery in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, achieved another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers gained in the second, a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch council, not achieved points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever A.J.Acht.
At Hughes, there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez exhibited due to a violation of the worms.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August due to a scratching shoulder, is expected to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a crackdown in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be held in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people travelling there will then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday night.
She expected 450 to 750 coming refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hezekian capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily underwent there.
They should then be redistributed to other municipalities.
Only in the past 10 days, according to the Government Presidency responsible for the first receipt, 7,500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I think the decisive thinking of military action options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective path views".
Four years ago, we were happy that the cup of military participation in Germany passed.
"Now the conflict is cryingly landing in front of our door," he said in Germany.
The former German ambassador in Washington also requested a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday at the Austrian television channel ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not returned refugees to Austria either.
“No, that’s so agreed,” she explained.
As to a question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there have already been talks between the Director-General of Public Safety and Germany’s representatives.
Concrete figures did not name it and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria through the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads, applied for a special summit for next week.
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday 22 September, the EU’s internal ministers will take a new start to binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee sandwich in Germany, the Federal Federation wants to stronger support countries in the first collection and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor’s office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection also have them.
Whoever has no perspective, cannot stay in Germany either.
This view has been substantially shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now needs to deal with “enormous strength”.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now held on the Balkan road.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced to lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighborhood belongs differently to the EU than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent trackers from looking for evasion routes across Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told the planned new border range.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who cut the wall.
According to eyewitnesses, thousands of other migrants went on the way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Space sound "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn Moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn Moon Enceladus, a global ocean swallows.
This includes researchers from the observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Therefore, the moon sparks lightly on its train around the ring planet.
Although this rolling movement is only small but nevertheless too large for a continuously solid heavenly body, Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) states on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the Icarus paper.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturn Moon, spiring water vapor and ice particles and therefore feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least on the southern pole there had to be a underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to refrain from offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation resulted in an addictive injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munich’s Lion, the diagnosis means “considerablely four weeks of forced pause.”
"That's hard for us, Rama is a serious loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an ununified professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defenseman.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already contracted at VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia has the opportunity to “prove its skills.”
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain shock.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will enter running training.
Okotie had injured her head in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a heavy collision.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mango contains a lot of sugar
Mango is exotic and juicy.
But whoever wishes to take attention to his lean line will often be rather advised by them.
Because mango contains relatively much sugar - especially saccharose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: B-vitamins and vitamins E and C are contained in them. Mango mainly contains a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta carotin.
Whoever eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangas should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasantly.
The bowl color alone doesn’t tell how ripe the fruit is - so green mango can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they naturally taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango also gives a special note to hearty dishes.
It mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS returns up to 95000 aids for the U.S. Christmas business.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched.
Already last year, UPS had increased his workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 aids.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have met earlier arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought to the package services a criticism.
First bathtub, then marking cold front
The next night, Meteo Switzerland announced on Tuesday, breaks through the valleys of the Alpine northern side of the shower.
On Wednesday and at night to Thursday, the hair dryer partly blows with storms through the hair dryer.
On Thursday morning, we have been crossing a remarkable cold front that brings strong rainfalls, windflows and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast low pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwest flow.
On the northern side of the Alps, it breaks through the valleys at Wednesday night.
As a result, the shower blows up to Thursday morning in the shower halls with bones from 60 to 100 km/h, single and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes with more than 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate the neighbouring middle country, and even orchards of more than 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north, on Wednesday, the storm shower provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the Alpen southern hinge begins to stain.
Here is the rain that continues until Thursday night.
In total, the south of the Alps has to be estimated in the next 48 hours with more than 100 liters of rain per square meter, after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the shower exits the air, then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially wicked rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind is strongly to stormful, and temperatures are significantly declining.
The following days present themselves in the north in autumn at 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer in the weekend up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
About 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, a previously named place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the Piazza Martin Lutero he is now deserved as a German theologian of Reformation.
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that Protestants in the town of the Popes, as a minority, often could only live in secret their faith for centuries.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) remained as a young Augustiner monk around the yearwise 1510/11 in Rome a few months.
He felt the city at the time as a deceived sin babel.
His negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then launched the division of the Western Church with his thesis against the dismissal trade.
Hammer Artists Invested Three Years in Personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colourful colors and fantasy shapes has received the 75-year-old - but it doesn't mean "pleasant" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can look quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has reached a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the Book of all books.
There are cycles devoting topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or our fathers.
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with its theological alignment, as well as the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who dealt with the respective Bible points on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible points chosen by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" in current relationships today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical citation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist, which here formulates his very personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry tape has gold letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born and raised in Wernigerode in 1940 in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Order of Lord Hutter.
“The education has been done with the pipestock,” recalls Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work on this to perhaps tolerate myself with the Lord Father again.”
His second concern is to help art again to be more important in a quick lifetime: "The perception of image worlds is today characterized by reclamations, and that is loud.
Symbolics are removed there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this regard, I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be "intruded" into the pictures, to look at themselves, to discover and to feel what strength they have: "The picture is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost stated on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, “although always” was a lover of Otmar’s Old Art: “I like how he understands life with his pictures.”
Oldly did not care to completely understand the Bible, but chose the important, even mysterious topics for him.
"This was not an eye-height cooperation," says Altepost, "here it's about the pictures, the text just explains."
For Hans Möhler from the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "depth his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts pictures speak for furs both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and screenshot - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction starts closer for BMX railway
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, Earth hills modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BMX train was finished again.
Faults in politics and administration ensured destruction, especially with the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the trains.
Therefore, hills were shot off, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction authorization.
The approval will be issued in October, First municipal council Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to report to the Children’s and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year will happen visible things," she said.
It should then be started with the works at the former bathroom without "next memory pause".
DFB intensifies engagement for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga makes a clear sign on the weekend.
Football reacts to the extreme situation in Germany and policy ensures its assistance in addressing the upcoming problems.
“I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the reunification.”
“No one can say that it’s nothing about me, I don’t have anything to do with it.”
"This must be an interest in each individual to manage this topic," DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23, he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm next Wednesday at the Chancellor's office and I meet Mrs. Ozoğuz and the Chancellor."
"This will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and want to help.
But the decisive displacement must put politics.
The German Football Alliance has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program continues by 2019,” Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some Bundesligaists also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are putting a clear sign when they will be printing "We Help - #refugee welcome" on the left handle instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Rudi Völler, Chief Sportsman of the Bild-Zeitung (Tuesday) and referred to the project as "self-comprehensibility."
“The refugee drama is on everyone, no one can see away.”
“We can football clubs, no, we need to use our radiation power, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league.”
For the EM qualification match against Hungary this Friday, the women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Salle.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as “a large community work of German football.”
That all 36 license associations had launched their own projects in their places is great.
It’s just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
This and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the entire sum for 2015 as well," Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive Board Loses Eye in Accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group Bill McDermott has lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
In the accident on the staircase in his brother’s house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water after midnight that he carried in his left hand, the “Economic Week” reported on Wednesday.
“He’s almost bleeded, was unhealthy, then dragged out to the street – that’s how he told us last week,” said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott can do his work.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is working at the meeting and “fully employable.”
In an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, McDermott announced that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
“I’m full of SAP there, full of my job.”
"Of course, I was all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," McDermott said.
McDermott usually pending between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can happen like this."
“It’s important to get up again when you fall.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except fighting...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell on the wheel.
He therefore comes as much as a reserve driver for the two stem pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of Marco Reus’ comeback in the first European League group match have finally broken up.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the Football Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"We can't resort to him unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach opened: “We expect him to return to training on Friday.”
Given the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribulation on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the gate guard position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of stamkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in the future in all the European League games, however, Tuchel left open.
He is likely to dispute the second game.
Co-player Reus’s research statement that the final income for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl believes to be understood: “Hence Marco is not so wrong.”
“I think we have a good chance to access the title.”
Robot cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany is expected to be a technological leader in the change of the car according to the will of the Federal Government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA trade fair of a "new mobility age".
The automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less storm, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet at the IAA with industry representatives.
The Strategy Paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a quick move to digital hearing radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently created on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to “no additional liability risks be taken up,” the Federal Government wants to “verify the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.”
For example, Germany wants internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers of hours.
The Federal Government also wants to make an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only considers people as a driver.
When automated driving, the car is increasingly guided, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles are expected on public roads “first far after 2020.”
The value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimates the authors of the study for 2025 at approximately €8.4 billion.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic,” Sören Bartol, SPD’s traffic policymakers, said.
However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically – much more than French or Americans.
A survey from the Forsa Institute presented on Wednesday on behalf of the test organization Dekra results in that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the coming decade, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous driving cars by 2025, with 33% in the United States.
The drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on an self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire drive on all roads.
On the motorway, 15 percent could be imagined in the flowing traffic, with 45 percent in stock.
Good every fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances.
Boll Declares Team and Double Start at Table Tennis-EM
The Düsseldorf will only take a look at the title fighting from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall fall at the latest on 22 September.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The boys have known it in the morning.”
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," Bundestrainer Jörg Rosskopf said during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight at a long-term agreed sponsor date in China.
The 34-year-old German master will be expected back on Friday.
“Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite now,” said single-European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the seat list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
“Then Timo also missed, and we have become Europe champions.”
"We should be oriented to this," the Fifth World Rankings said.
England’s football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has injured the right leg.
At the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a rail break at the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax-figure group cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: show window dolls that look scary human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and that he put men in clothes.
“I can’t say today that I am the terrible child of the Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
“It was black before, but now it’s real,” said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk to The Catwalk", which is seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Culture Foundation from 18 September, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his initially refusing attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was opposed, because "an exhibition sounded for me a little after death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, director of the art hall.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibitions give an insight into the hardly to be overviewed work of the man who has written fashion story without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work for which much effort has been operated: for example, to refresh the dolls, a stylist has been dedicated.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of materials have carved the manufacturers to Munich.
Shortly before the launch of the Oktoberfest, there was still a special man: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultiers' old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer’s first, sharp fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn’t have allowed him.
The design of fashion taught himself later.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later, of course, I bought it.
For his first fashion view he was unable to pay the models.
They didn’t get anything, but they could keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of gardine - plauder tip as fashion niche
Earlier, it came to the long embroidery machines in and to plauges about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantity for customers, for example, who continued to process them into ceilings and gardens.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
Fashion played a greater role in the early times of the Plauener Spike, then was removed by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt presents some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as pockets and regional costumes.
Absolutely, the so-called vintage mode, which resorts to past style times, represents an increasing contract potential.
Whoever does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market.
We already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Stickers together with nine other companies.
Only you can wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80% of the revenue has broken down.
There are almost no longer private specialty shops and the wholesale.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
The massware is manufactured much cheaper in the Asian area today and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are now weakened to Russia and the United States.
Sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Sticker Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we are carrying a quality label that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Exhibition Office of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroideries and tips.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the most fresh ideas of designers and the companies that need to think more economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snowball tip.
In some places, the machine sticks small cucumbers.
Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I couldn't start anything with traditional plauener tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Top – young and old,” says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memory piece.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Top.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends shouldn’t be touched, but Disney is still daring to a new movie of her classic Mary Poppins.
It’s not about a new film, but about a sort of continuation that plays with the magic girl 20 years after the first film.
It’s about the experiences of the nanny with the family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
Rob Marshall, finally with "Into the Woods" in the movie.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to be broader outwards to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned to lead the reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investments and know-how and improving strategies for business establishments," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the central leadership group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new developments and promoting reforms will bring new vitality and vitality and will provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state companies (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the residential reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is of importance, as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also lighten controls over the powers granted to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
Furthermore, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a lasting residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee the lawyers to perform their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury border in predatory fish
The European Commission aims to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fishes and thus encourage consumers to a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, presenting a corresponding EU workpaper, sharply criticized the plans: “Risks and side effects of missing industry and environmental policy are being fully delivered to pregnant women and young children,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt at Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish for "economic political reasons", are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
But large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury today that about 50 percent of the captures cannot be sold on the basis of the current limit values.
After the duplication of the limits, only 14.5% would be unsale.
In return, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to sharpen the limits for other fishes from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch referred to this as "trick" because smaller friedfish, like carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore “a perfide distraction manoeuvre that helps the economy alone,” said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is heavily enriched over the food chain especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government warns therefore that “already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborns.”
The Federal Environment Ministry on its homepage states, however, that a “health threat to the general population” is not expected.
Mercury enters the environment primarily through coal burning.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants exhibit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "lasting and spatially exceeded," the "mirror" in March cited from the paper.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish have already been one of the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
