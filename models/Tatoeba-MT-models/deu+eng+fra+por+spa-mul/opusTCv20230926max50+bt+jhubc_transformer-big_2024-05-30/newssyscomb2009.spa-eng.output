Populist right triumph in Austria, together form 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought according to the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have suffered from the Austrian People’s Party (OVP), where the position of current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously disappointed.
On the contrary, the leader of the Austrian Future Alliance (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national policy.
According to approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, so it loses 5.5 percent votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The worst OVP has still finished that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, populars had a considerable advantage in terms of preference before the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for allowing the government to narrow.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the president of the party and, until today, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could be achieved on Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and most approximate starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the reinforcement of both Right Populist parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the European Union would repeat the same in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the Populists (then the FPO was a unity in 2005).
For this evolution, clearly bets Haider who already announced he is prepared to collaborate with any party and who already takes his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach Parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit, and therefore it is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India Can Cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegal collection of crabs is not achieved, it could be a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
Thus the minister demonstrated in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this wasn't resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get into.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from accusation and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter remains.
"Their problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said, it would be best to appeal to the highest instances.
Then you can apply for the exemption of the case and wait freely for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the Superior Court and then the indulgency would be possible," said the Head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to get the convicted a "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian party.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, to its colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider in tremendous mistake imprisonment and condemning these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister resolved the answer to the question whether he received from the Indian party the promise he would deal with the matter.
“I have received plenty of promises,” he just found.
A Czech arbitrates a struggle in the marine background
I approach an electronic wall map, in which it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
It does not, however, interest the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the marine background surrounding it.
The region is at the same time as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His head, head of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Govern this talk and work enthusiasm.
The marine background hides to date a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far that itself carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the firm earth.
Countries with coastline have begun today to fight strongly the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these are taking advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the so-called Continental Edge that sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, by the continental edge is understood the part of the marine bottom and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reachs the limit of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred marine miles, that is, pure economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the given country to the Commission, for the delimitation of the external boundaries of the continent, should be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a specialist technical and legal assistance commission.
The commission has processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand so far.
For now, only those of the last three mentioned countries have gone forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominion.
However, New Zealand also achieved it - the marine bottom surface that the commission gave it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains in their study.
The profit that will come from the use of the marine background will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also little by little submitting their requests.
It can be carried out until ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
There where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean background declared by Treaty as “common heritage of humanity”.
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The marine background, however, is not any gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphasizing, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the marine background also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the faculty to exploit in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something larger than ancient Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is accidental, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
“A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploded.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete grounds containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan said.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
He reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action.
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help—the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, German special forces also participated in indirect mode.
Therefore, in the place of release were German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officials, federal police plane squad, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also experts in the logistics field of the technical charitable institution.
As the ministry spokespersons reported Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent liberation, let their prisoners go and escape.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as a support on site.
"Fortunately, that time didn't come," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Interior said.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and its eight Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages deported them from one side to the other into the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He said no word about the details of liberation.
At the beginning in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper Bild, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany’s air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States does not approve salvation package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed with scarce a large $700 billion salvation package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government’s package for salvation of financial markets.
Despite all appeals by President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate defenders had still attempted to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked members to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It's hard to receive political approval to avoid something that hasn't yet happened," he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or to 600 points.
The cause of that was the concerns of investors that the state salvation package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record increased number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume of 31 percent more than the same period last year.
According to research from the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the booking information analyzed at 1,200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakening course of the dollar above all travels to the United States are high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one-third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and feeding prices increase, in this case travel spending is "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year increased again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the Endless Balneario, the beer in one-litre jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Really, Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit tailored.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that joins us: we're barely in the tent, photographers already precipitated towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very sweet above all because I'm first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you become friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costumes until this day was still limited.
But after getting to the Prado of Teresa everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be unpleasant or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my fork gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munichess draws my attention to my antenna that was dressed wrongly: "The left part is single, half is the virgin, on the right part is committed, behind it is widow."
O God, now I broke behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
Others don’t worry about many of the subtle methods of flirting and carry cats where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their knot ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him seems "gorgeous", which pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me that after he put his glass next to a liter of beer that he just drinked.
He put it directly next to the fire mouth, most think that's a cube of garbage.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others aren’t lucky and can’t consume so much alcohol.
About eight of the night the healthcare groups run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunk.
Healthcare facilities appear each time in group – suddenly they’re always four people bringing the walks covered from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: they come sober, they come drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from alcoholemia and is in the walks.
“They are the ones who can’t anymore,” answered a healthcare provider, answering my question and disappeared in tumultuation.
Victim of accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in Brentwood City, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspect of negligent driving.
Since then, it has been released under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers denied the desire to penetrate within this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inward Asia, there is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to the end of the platforms and takes two towers, one for each corner, all seemingly a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the boxbox was overcome, there is no doubt what the company’s greatness was that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curious to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell down
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station decayed and stayed outside of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish government maintains excellent good relationships with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed up to a paper and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shaking, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, intended to rule a new secular state, away from the past of Ottoman.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspects in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centres and "power pastels" where mid-class managers in business costume - men and women - meet at the early hour of the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he's still got a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the east and the west.
It’s not a case if it’s not towards one or another.
You have to do both things.
"But probably at some point," I asked, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "doesn't want to face that choice."
I then emphasize a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken until that time had recited me almost of memory: the relationships that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the region of the Caucasus, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for the same Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had assisted in the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, largely, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that at those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
There is no doubt in which the continent that this fascinating country must claim will be.
Remember life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: The musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under the age of 21, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, several of us were ended 20 years old - we just refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the choir's will and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "leave music speaking for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His skirt was always absolutely clear and accurate, although never tax, nor too florida.
Whatever the musical scratch, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades when he directed the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the past 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by none, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve been many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modestness.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses all over the world."
We'll miss a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequence of William Woodruff (September 25), you state that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time she was studying for a degree, one master and one doctoral."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff’s author in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at universities in Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham to Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career, is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
“I recommend José Vicente Resino’s exhibition ‘Flamenco et vie’ because his black and white, documentary style photographs are fantastic.
I was drawn attention for their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resin can capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's superselling
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the jazz.
If its precessor had already a wide habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this all, refined mechanics are added, which increase driving comfort and allow saving more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is important to note an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, we have to comment that this new jazz comes six years after launching the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the employee by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost a million jazz units have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants this new jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of jazz, in 2009 the estimates aim at 100,000 cars, which would suggest a 17% growth in the European market.
With respect to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 units of jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the next generation, officials of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new jazz will allow Honda to highly pain the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand officials expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which amounts to 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this fee, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters length - from which the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is held in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its rates.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and the distance between the axes up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
Height, instead, does not vary and stays at 1.52 meters.
In addition to increased dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the capacity of the baggage - which has a double-background system - is up to 399 liters, 19 liters more of the first generation baggage capacity.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 baggage is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to outdoor elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite the 67 degrees of the first jazz.
Engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 liter gasoline propulsors.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-liter mechanics obtains a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rounds.
This driver - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - presents a spending of 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Regarding the previous driver, who in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, is now going to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 out of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bees' car that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired this time, in nature, particularly, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center engineers have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the capacity of prevention of collision vehicles of the brand.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to a boarding microprocessor which immediately results in the prevention of collision.
“At the time it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels in a straight or older angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a be, the robot cannot be diverted up or down or in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotational function, in addition to acceleration and slowdown, for the small robot to avoid collision.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require storage of information or intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigas, not even megas.”
This is the first step to develop new instant collisions prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan Vaticin will be introduced into series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tiemble before being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to inject, is not lacking ingeniency.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on waste mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a smooth and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the hotel of bad credits... or trouble.
The tetrical aspect of this accommodation and especially your receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It has useful, but little detailed information.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because buying a better house neither talking about...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low of its exchange quote.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of ordinary stocks Morgan Stanley at a price of $25.25 per unit, i.e. $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will guarantee a 10% yield and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of a price per measurement unit of $29, i.e. 28% above its current exchange.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” explained Juan Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities, but he is passing under the Federal Reserve’s authority.
His partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the bigger names of Wall Street to adopt much more cautious behavior than before.
The modality presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought that participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold with more than 50% above the conversion price, that is to $47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures capitals contributed by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A group spokesman nevertheless refused to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan needed to have relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, who saw his exchange quote drop down to half while the cost of safety against a risk of defects on his debt dropped.
This cost dropped back on Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only “surviving” of Wall Street’s big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers’ crashes and Merrill Lynch’s purchase, announced to have raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Reinforce the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, for example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64 per cent of voters voted “yes” to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80 per cent of the suffrages.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the plus one suffrages.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exit of the electoral centers and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimating between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed crushingly," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians leading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also for her Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution involves increasing State power over the economy, reserved the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currency sending their emigrates.
The project, elected by Correa in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, which may perform up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and plan a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the freedom of health and education services that the president began establishing in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty threshold.
It finally anticipates the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point of U.S. drug operations.
19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault against the rappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in the Egyptian capital after they were released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good at their arrival at 15:30 aboard a special plane to the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters carried them immediately to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb in Cairo, to be undergone medical tests, so they were unable to talk to the press.
"They are well healthy" and "no rescue was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell in power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all-terrenis in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they moved from one to another.
The group consisted of eleven Italian tourists, five Germans and one Romanian and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptus travel agency, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had thrown the assault overnight before dawn.
"A shooting exchange occurred, and half of the kidnappers killed, the others have fled," said the official who retained the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, of special forces," he said.
In addition, he declined the payment of a rescue.
The eve the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a whole-terreno on board of which were the kidnappers, of whom she killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical places that die of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remember the federal government to miss its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restore it only the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all the government departments, and all this, in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec’s History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to seek in history, preserve with little money lots of private archives, and preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the dogs guardians of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemetery.
When, a monument for history and heritage?
The Netherlands governments nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank that is seen in trouble due to the effect of the U.S. market mortgage crisis: the three countries will totally support this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the president of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Eurozone crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been produced in several waves more than a year ago, therefore decisions taken with respect to the Bank can in a certain sense be considered precedent.
According to the decision taken in Sunday morning, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will safely sell a portion of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amro.
The shares of the Fortis started a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week, important signs of crisis were already seen in the institution.
However, analysts agree to note that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to crash.
The company’s shares only on Friday declined by 12 percent, this being the lowest point in the past 14 years.
Since January the value of shares has decreased with more than two-thirds.
Noting the current prices of shares, the total value of the group’s market capital is around €14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management imposed the sudden fall of Fortis shares to the insecurities of the U.S. market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the actions have already shown a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors didn’t have to worry about, they’re not going to lose their money.
Among the Bank’s customers so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies seeing drug purchase data, often deny signing a insurance agreement.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will be uncontrollable.
“There are personal data protection programs, which in all cases combine the data from the recipes to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken to the fox" - quote the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies rely on the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the outcome of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number easily get from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last and a half year and the program itself draws the conclusion about customer diseases and health status.
For example, if you take systematically large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the blood fat level is virtually incurablely high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circle numerous versions of the program, some setting even a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has just something to do, although there are small difficulties in it.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medications are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
This latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which before purchasing the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient’s approval.
The authorities have already forced them to do this, although they have not received a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies recently also draw up the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more company has access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that provides the right to the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already in front of Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such person cannot deny its approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Because the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other most global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth Summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, to address mainly cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet reached a common denominator about whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU shift president, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and Javier Solana, foreign policy chief representative, received Manmohan Singh, India’s Prime Minister with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase his trade exchange to more than 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that between the years 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
Thus, they legally harmonised the twenty-seven existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the Free Trade Treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is to balance, because while the EU is India’s first trade partner, New Delhi only appears in the ninth place among the Union’s trade partners.
The Summit paid its attention to global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all the forms of the latter - and prescribed the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both parties have a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e., by 2020 it wants to decrease pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees to this, as in the next year’s climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and decreased by 2050 with fifty percent greenhouse gas production.
They also wish to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to revise the financial crisis.
Today, India's head of government will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive charges of €20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international sample of the Frankfurt Book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the Frankfurt Book awaits for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the sample with more than 403,000 exhibition titles and with Turkey as a host of honor.
It will be the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian flag: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point of Italy - 264 square meters of exposure space.
It will follow an encounter with the Stamp at the Room Structure in the Buchmesse pavilion 5.0: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and forward-looking on the state of editorials in Italy.
According to data, the weight of foreign author books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane was found missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett’s plane were found, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris have been found on a 3,000-metre altitude high plain, in the area of Mammoth Lakes’ Nevada saw, in the confine between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has disappeared the remaining doubts still: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmed that it's the own thing about which Steve Fossett was flying the day of his disappearance," he said in a stamp conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the remains’ sight, a squad of researchers has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is the Bellanca 8kcab own, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett departed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's confine, some personal remains from Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett’s search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of firstpieces.
In 2002, the sixth tentative, he had become the first Man to complete the world’s turn into an aerostatic balloon: two weeks alone flight.
Three years later he had turned the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his record, also that for having flyed at 15,445 meters di height, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A Suv out of schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among the “compact” all-ground trucks of the star’s house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own for the content outside of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls since October 17.
The advertising campaign to accompany the debut of the new car launches an unpublished modality of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, first used in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which would dominate the central street of the Milan shopping street, avenue Como, until November 15.
The primary phase of this new type of communication started with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on Avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three dimensions format.
Indeed, looking at the pictures will have the impression that the car leaves out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of innovated Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose itself in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now embarrassed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to say the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The removal of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia have been added.
They have three-colored flags where the town of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been drawn out so they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: Between what had left for Sofia, there was none with a Daspo (the prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, none that had been forbidden to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of Interior expects to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take steps: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) that prevents frequency not only from Italian stadiums but also from all over Europe.
Our hooligans will not put any more foot in a stadium.
Luckily!
But now is the fear of imitation: that those few fifty, others may be added.
“We have to quit this fire immediately and not legitimate who behaves in this way,” the Ministry of Interior said.
That’s why, “well open eyes” especially in view of the National Wednesday party in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of holders from Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow meets the Observatory, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"Duce-Duce's choirs and the arm lifted during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria is not a reality ...."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been the head of Trieste of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not real to celebrate the Duce but if, the behavior of those 150-200 fans who have been embarrassing.
“I do not do the sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s paragraph 1 – the reactions are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what happened and take into account for the future.
But let’s talk also about the silbids of Mameli’s anthem: they are also not a reality, but if they are not allowed, they are not educational.
