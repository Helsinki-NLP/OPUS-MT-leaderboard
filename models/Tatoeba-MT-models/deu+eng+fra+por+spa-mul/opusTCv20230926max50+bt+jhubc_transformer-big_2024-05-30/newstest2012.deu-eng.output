No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish those paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned under a novel of the Criminal Code.
The new arrangement, which could have embraced the path towards the freedom of the detained Ex-Premier Minister, was rejected by Members in the second reading of the application for mitigation of penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of a supposedly adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legitimate, and the appeal of the convicted will be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political vengeance of the regime and also in the West, the trial suspected the preconcept of the court.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Ex-Premier Minister was condemned to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required to be accepted.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, victories in the Islamist elections, the question is only which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized itself as the law of habit of the Shari<0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one now has a certain idea in God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, the hand is hacked off shortly.
Women should also forget the thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united from each other commanding tribes in the future by the Qur’an.
In short, in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imagined and above all hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen, probably not the best, and variation would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
Thus, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters allowed themselves to be helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To their apology may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself whose all-power was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya, the West isn't one of them.
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians dissolved themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without giving any advantage.
According to the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we rather looked away from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the hitlers are a concern - i.e. the expulsion of the cruisers.
Do mineral oil companies get black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Little and so, the West can finally boast with the right of its selflessness in respect of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy them the representatives of Shari<0xCA><0xBF>a.
The beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe are focused on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm deep across Europe was broken.
The individual states published their information on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the pre-quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market has broken all records.
Investors keep not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in mind.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, from France by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of 0.1% predicted), while France granted a slight decline by 0.1% (original information only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the statistical office, the trend in growth slowing economic performance confirmed.
The results are worse than the forecasts of analytics.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year, however, compared to the previous quarter it stagnated.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated information, the German economy increased by 0.5% in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and across the EU, the economy was growing by 0.2 percent from July to September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to analytics’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The return from its 10-year-old state bonds is worth 28.45%.
The return of Italian and Spanish state bonds increased to its critical boundaries.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries begin to feel problems...
Returns in Czech government bonds are below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualify for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football choice has mastered the hardest task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well set gateway Čech and a magnificent gateway by Petr Jiraček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will not even miss again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant proportion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won pretty happy 1:0 thanks to the final weaknesses of the home team, a brilliant Čech’s and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and thus redesigned their ticket for the EM football.
Even because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegrins under pressure in the second half-time.
The pech birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which disappeared two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed next year at the European Championships, and it is also happy that the domestic football has a prize of approximately 200 million.
From the first few minutes, pretty combative football was played.
Both teams combined long-term and thus were played above all around the middle line.
Even in the second half the pressure of the home team remained out and the widespread defeats against the criminal area were successfully removed by the Czech defence.
Iran’s students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday midnight before the property and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the Iranian university in Isfahan formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed.
This means that they wanted to let them know that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary, even with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has seem to have not given up after its efforts to a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel, it is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students prayed in the noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack led in the intention of laying the Iranian nuclear program largestly lame, the Israeli press said from the centre in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It doesn’t breakfast and eats for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of students and 5% of children overweight.
Current surveys have been proven - adipose children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
Thus, once again, it shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, worst goods up to half are more frequently on the table than in families where normal weighty children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had apples on the early day of the action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" for dinner bread.
In families with thickness, sports isn’t just one of the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today’s students – only 15% replied that their parents find themselves less time for active movement once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools throughout Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the “Adipositas is not a coincidence” action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are decisive factors responsible for the scary growing number of children with overweight or even fat addiction.
"Only half of the children surveyed to eat, for example, five times a day, in the mode Breakfast-second Breakfast-Vesper-Evening Bread - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," one of the survey results said.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone breaks alone.
The worst thing was the conclusion that in every tenth family is not breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered as the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test brought, among other things, to the day that in families of overweight children, we consumed much more unhealthy apples.
And almost everyone – without regard to weight – drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40% of children surveyed sports, only less than half of their parents do that – that is, only 15%.
Assemble your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from opportunities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite meals were many flour meals, meat meals and, of course, sweet meals.
“Alarming is mainly the great popularity of sweet limonades,” the final report emphasizes on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, teawares were victorious just before poultry.
Children almost didn’t like anything and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their eating habits when they get proper information.
"In the control group of survey stakeholders who completed the questionnaire after completion of the clarifying lecture "Adipositis is not a coincidence," a significant shift of preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition was in many cases," the project stated in the results.
For example, in the sweet limousines, where many children began to give the priority to ordinary water.
The children crossed in the questionnaire also much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less knobs or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a little bit liked that it was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Lectures from three professionals in the industry, clothing of problematic figures, and a seminar on how the "square" is running.
It should be worse.
The closer the examination comes, the more information and practical tasks are in front of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully demonstrated.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (in the course does not take a single man) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportionate figure.
And these are most of us.
Some have one too short neck, others one too young figure without ordinary curves and others are soft.
It is the matter of the stylist to visually cash wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large breasts, wide hip and narrow waist - beautiful and figurbeton without it to be too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the rock or pants really don’t fit, you should be allowed to cut at least one piece by custom.
You will definitely not regret this because good-sitting clothes are simply unprecedentable.
In such a tailor-made rock, you feel much better than in a rod that stands too high and rotated, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, builds, applications, embroideries or raffle.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost unable to achieve in the face of the household task applied.
Indeed, each of the students received a prome for which they should design appropriate outfits - daily clothing and evening clothes.
In this case, we should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "attract Miranda Kerr" you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than attracting, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in the last time (okay, that’s a little overwhelmed), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut off the clothes from magazines or search, print, and then edit graphically.
In the moodboard, as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design are to be expressed.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the style.
Indeed, the stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But this is only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about character types was equally prepared by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion creator Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And sent stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual on the jeans, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes and wear it as a dress.
It’s enough to remove the sleeves or the collar and the entire look looks quite different.
“It’s playing with it,” he emphasized.
But most of the advice was given to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can hurt them,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we have to pause all these lessons, what to combine with what and why, even if you often get things else to see in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variations than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all this must be expected in designing the outfit.
That image and style sometimes represent half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not just brilliant singer from image and marketing, who made a world star.
In Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this for money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if someone of us is already left to style, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to force us on a whole (smaller) size than he or she in reality needs.
Then you only need to google to determine that the boulevard press writes, that the promise has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario took us to heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit to "build together".
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he has to be a psychologist.
People appreciate themselves without being offered and standing in their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't clean out the entire wardrobe and tell her - my God, that's awful."
“You have to find at least a few praiseful things to recommend what you can do,” Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "square bag" must contain.
So a pocket that you tap on the waist and wear all the necessary proprieties.
Besides clear things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are not tapped behind, if they are too large, or undernearing.
But in order to not only listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to stick footwear properly.
Even when photographing at the atelier where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe sole, weigh the outside.
We clothed and clothed...
You cannot even touch your shoes with the shear so that you cannot damage them.
So you really have to do it skillfully.
Mario delighted me praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not just my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has now become clear to me - dedicating to styling at a professional level is not a child play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The initially careless ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, diletant mistakes to the routine ride to the early layer.
Although it was able to fulfill the ambitions for a large part, but what is it already useful if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Before he came to the shop desks, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" awakened high expectations.
He promised that the old game series "Need for Speed" would move a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious how the fitted passages fall, where the main protagonist climbs out of the car and walks on foot.
But as you have already used to NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - it's potentially fairly decent arcade races, but overall, the game is scattered by some excessive mistakes that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible failure of game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
The first time you are introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain personal character problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the western coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages will take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
No moment you have the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing worldwide moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or up through deeply snowed landscape works visually very pleasant.
Once again, untypical elements bring a little bit of variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits the view.
In the mountains, you have to be carefully careful that you don’t be poured out by a lavine.
On the other hand, the individual races are quite well built in a consequence.
Just a few, but they're enough.
A while you’re trying to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to take up (class race against the stop clock), then you expect a personal duel with a single counterpart.
And the police also join themselves, who wants to massage the whole thing to you.
A newness is passes where Jack leaves the car.
It’s rather about certain interactive animations in which Jack flies from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (probably only three).
Ultimately, this is rather the advantage of the thing, because so this element at least has no chance to become bored - it is in the context of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model goes into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, seen from today’s point of view, it doesn’t remove trees, but on the other hand it couldn’t be claimed to be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations must look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded racing model will continue to be fair, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From such a game it is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When tightly surpassing or precipiting cars, some places the other cars are “streated” easily, in others, almost identical situation, but it comes to the slurry and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the car drives to the crack right away.
Thanks to the restart system, this is nothing else, but it is annoying.
The restarts are resolved so: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw one of the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
If you have taken it out, everything goes ahead.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn’t help even the restart, there’s nothing else that helps to learn the critical section from your head.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen at the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to pass through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply won’t fit.
Otherwise, you’re always meeting “civil” cars at the corresponding place in the same configuration, whether you’re first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the counterpart goes through in front of a playing two opposite cars, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in a position that you have to ride or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it’s always going to this situation closely before your nose.
Contractors have further advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overcome at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without regard to the time.
Most crazy, this is for the end of the game on the long bridge you go through in the opposite direction.
The counterfeit must obviously get a devil out here.
And if he’s already ahead of one, he’ll take the view of you, so you’ll start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly loses the pleasure of the game to you.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in a position, also action-loaded that you almost no longer know where one of the heads stand.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "fault" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the races.
You cannot overlook the gasoline stations on the track because just here you can switch the car, though in most cases the car you have just is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game story mode also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations you know from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach the higher level of driver, various items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also provides further collective features.
One of the other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (for it), where you run long on the rail in the dark (for it).
On the tacho, figures are between 150 and 200 km/h (for it), but there comes at once a subway from behind and a compromiseless drive to crack.
In our editorial, we’ll probably be arguing for a long time whether it was a blackout of the playmakers or whether the authors think we’re so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression in most cases is quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
The more angry is that in some exciting moments, the re-frequency of images becomes slower and sometimes pretty dramatic.
This concerns, however, the accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound play is so far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste matter.
In an effort to address as wide as possible scale rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone" emerged - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn’t reminded by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we would have been able to claim with the tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game looks unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to get these mistakes in your eyes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
Czechs have the reputation of negativists and eurosceptics
“The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance of the individual institutions feelingfully out of the lot.”
I wouldn’t have expected such a hard war to burn up.”
"It will take five or six years until the waves become smooth and all have accustomed to her new role," Czech Ambassador Milena Vicenová, a Czech ambassador in the European Union, started a fairly sharp lecture at the Law Faculty.
How serious she takes the motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such an overviewable and understandable way that she could have been envying many of the Legal Faculty of Karl.
Ms. Vicenová also praised the new steady Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism became loud that he was too unremarkable - a gray official who didn't grow such a role, but I have to say that it has breathed everyone how well he assumed the thing.
“He is a person who makes it finish to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas about how to go on with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained her as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards States, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil hats
Ms. Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago called her a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency called it a great negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently doing all the hands fully.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only hectic in the presidency but also in the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And there is still need to be approved the seven-year budget of the EU, making it much more complicated because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and saving budget, which industries will be prioritized, which countries more and which less will be promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehensible about Europe."
“If I don’t like something, it’s green shortcuts, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how should I actually know whether you really expand yourself in Brussels or round agurk and different large bananas, or whether someone actually wants to forbid us the quargel?
It would also have used the EU soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, Czechs are in reputation to be eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is the more angry.
There are many factors, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also emphasized the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
“Believe me, if a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slovakia is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, ‘Hey, what are your heads together—it’s your V4 again?” and it makes a pretty acidic mine.
According to Ms. Vicenové, the EU expects tough rules for the budget policy of the member states in the future.
As much more real, as a “European Federation” it considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries beyond the eurozone.
“We have the Schengen area and we have already the institute of strengthened cooperation.”
“For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those who don’t want it should stand quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately relies on a strong "Europe of different speeds", Ms. Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for an appropriate word that IBM’s strategy would characterize the most accurate, this would probably be the word “duration”.
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity has already laid her first chief - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan “Think!” became a trademark to play the life of the future giant (at the same time as the title of the company’s internal magazine that IBM began to release in 1935).
This was also the foundation of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear back from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope we will create even more in the next 100 years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s today’s director of the anniversary.
Perforated system
In the thirty years, Watson operates social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baża in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a working clothes, and a thoughtful reward system for best new and traders.
Similarly, IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are also skilled.
The company was genial in talent promotion from the beginning – as one of the first companies in the world, IBM raised any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been at IBM for thirty years, so far she took up the position of the head of Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has made so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are occupied in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Their unspoilable position in business guarantees a strong image to the company, both indoor and outdoor.
“From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist, professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology,” added George Colony from Consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to only be present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo called "Big Blue" because of their family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have been awarded Nobel Prize.
Its most well-known inventions include, for example, bank automates, credit cards, financial swap, string code or even the disc.
With approximately $220 billion exchange value (market capitalization) IBM was this year the second largest technology company (equally after Apple), with Microsoft overcoming it for the first time since 1996.
The sight ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers – for example, they were unhappy to try with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even the IBM PC computers.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you cannot be emotionally bound to the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the counterplayer Microsoft, who is in principle standing and falling with its operating system Windows.
Successful technologies
IBM’s gains are largely involved in services, software and hardware, each participating in one fifth.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent percentage of the strongest was represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis was the first time as a storm over the world.
Also here IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, which increased its investment range in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
To date, IBM seems to survive the current crisis without prejudice.
Since 2008, the value of IBM stocks has increased as a missile by 120 percent, and the company’s net profit is continuously increasing.
IBM’s corporate logo is that everything can change – only the values cannot be changed.
Therefore, this flexible giant should also be expected to master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - initially it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history returns until the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as, for example, the famous stick card watches for registration of the work beginning and end.
The architect of this new company became Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competitor company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM into the shadow – based on Watson’s ideas until today, the unbeatable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already reveals, began with the manufacturing and distribution of all possible machines for the trading – from sausage and cheese cutters to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential for the company that he sat in the head chair for forty years, until then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers of IBM helped lead NASA flights to the All – to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture – the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered into the business of high-value consulting services and services.
The strategy IBM has been paid over the past three years is the concept “Smart Planet”.
It embodies the intention of intelligent use of technologies in areas not even planned to date, such as improving the situation in transport and city administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in the Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The central central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep yourself, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) became her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Joseph will wake up from his pink-red dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, the singer I. Bartošová, had provided shelter in her own house, she probably wouldn’t even have felt in the dream how it goes out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to Śíčany after 30 days, Joseph went with her.
He even knows publicly that he loves them.
Over time, Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she gave him the final pass.
Rychytář doesn’t matter who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová had to leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not leave him away.”
“But not as a beloved, misleaded old donkey, but as a man to whom I have certain bonds,” Mrs. Rychtářová said; but she also said she has already emotionally separated herself from him and stands alone on mutual destiny.
The circumstance that Darina has locked him the back door, Joseph has been worthy of dignity so far.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper husband and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'm taking care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I'm doing the purchases."
"I speak with Darina very normally, just the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care whether she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I’ve fallen in love with Iveta and that’s why I take any responsibility.
The worst women's unsuggestion: what about you?
If you urge the men to call some typical female untumblers, then they shake some quickly from the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we leave a few unseen reviews that leave the blood to the men in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband prepare for them to be shopping addicts?
Do you need to buy at least one hate a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can be a little more in action?
Then, in your case, it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their purchasing pleasure half-way under control.
But the hand on the heart, which woman already holds it out of looking for a well-sitting upper clothing only through a clothing shop and not trying out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how often they told her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
“I’d have to weigh at least five pounds – should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?”
"Do I get you at all?"
Is that somehow known to them?
Oh, yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are actually obsessed with how they look.
This doesn’t long mean you should leave, but many men react allergic to when their wife constantly mourns about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with increasing frequency of discomfort, women are increasingly untolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Wipe windows, wipe tiles and dust, the bathtub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you shame with your partner because he again trampled on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you shame the kids because the just shot washbasin is dirt again and the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where do polishing makes so much effort?
If you are suffering from this type of "deviance", you should know that nothing can be overwhelmed and the order and cleanliness in family life is not in the first place.
This immense purety fimmel can ultimately damage mutual relationships and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stitching
"Dirty turn pants come into the laundry basket."
“Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?”
“A wet towel is not just thrown on the floor.”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirada, you shouldn’t be surprised that this brings him to the palm tree.
Of course, it isn’t bad, they just want that all has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much to make.
Slash and Slash
Some women like to crack and trap, there are towed behind their backs, or even deceived or forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to discuss such topics, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each woman has a little harmless mock and mock in stock.
Hand on Heart - this is probably all women.
However, this is not to be confused with climbing gross calibers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, which probably despises everyone in their surroundings and poses a significant danger especially for women’s collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
Ice hockey assault Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia’s 5:3 victory on the ice in Carolina during the NHL Monday game with two assistants and is again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who was added an assistant and announced the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed towards journalists that he had prophesied Giroux for a great evening.
“Before the game, I tell him that he’s going to have a hattrick today.”
I felt that somehow.”
"Him and again, such a feeling is overcome," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux already achieved a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track."
Voraček fighted the puck behind the Hurricane Gate and introduced it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first-third pipple, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second-third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he achieved his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr said in a statement.
“I wouldn’t have remembered in life that I played together with such an ice hockey player at the end of my career, like with him.”
"I'm really happy."
"I'm cutting my game to myself."
"All the years in the NHL, my co-players set their game on me and now the spindle turns around," said Jágr.
Carolina made the game the drama – through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who underwent a criminal shoot, came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent acting pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more remote posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it's worked," Voraček described the final match from his perspective.
Through this victory, Philadelphia sat at the top of the eastern conference.
Montreal’s Czech defense player Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and exited in the second third because of a injury on the upper body.
In addition to her experienced Beck, the candies also lost their guidance an unloaded in the penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of the penalties.
More than the lost points, the home team’s coach probably pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive – the game only played with five defense players.
"That's bad."
“The encounter we only played with a single experienced player, the rest were young players.”
"But nothing can be done so we have to do," Martin said.
“At every change, an attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to counter it.”
“We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third.”
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defence players.
The Czech gate guard Ondřej Pavelec stopped thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thereby ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold at the time only travel to the socialist eastern block countries, and at the time only chosen people were allowed in the west.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia hit a prowest course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were strongly restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely to citizens of the Eastern Bloc (so the Czechoslovakians) within the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even at that time, the travel agencies also offered travel to the west, but then you had to take huge snakes in purchase or even stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or at least have "good known" in the travel agency.
The thing hasn't been doing so for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange – the condition for an exit to the West – was granted only “politically reliable” people – the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely exchangeable currency, so without currency currency it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most Czechs have spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs have bought countless weekend houses and dats – a custom that continues until today.
The tent revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the level of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that you are not aware of today is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular Czech vacation country until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslavia.
From the early 90s of the last century, the currency obligation was abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, creating a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn’t get enough from their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymen slept in the tent in the park when they traveled to Paris, because who would have had the money for a hotel or a pension at the time.
A typical feature in Czech foreign trips was at the time a fully packed suitcase with conserves, beer and lasting sausage etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech Crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to shop the Western currency freely.
Our livelihood and therefore the average salaries increased, which in 1997 entered into another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, the travel agencies after 1997 began regularly preparing travel through charter flights, making flight travels incredibly constrained thanks to the opportunity to negotiate quantitative discounts.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, had already currency-free payment traffic with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-some" travel traffic came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight was transferred to an exotic country - to Thailand thanks to the high demand.
Since then, direct charter airplanes with Czech passengers fly every year into far-sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are directly flying from Czech.
The Czechs are traveling to exotic countries every year.
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. relinquished visa obligation for Czech tourists, making our country definitely ranked among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they expendited for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the holiday site more than 15 centimeters per capita.
The General Assembly is to find a new president - again threatens a pat.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been president and threatens that Ivan Hašek’s successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date there is no agreement on which election order is to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek, the old crosses broke out again between the two association chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new president was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for no result, and it was not only about the election itself.
Indeed, one could not even agree on who is actually voting rights in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with an authority.
At this only point, at least partly agreement was achieved, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion was not appropriate for a representation based on authority.
However, the disputes about the election order continue to continue.
The Executive Committee has also no longer brought clarity to the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is at all on the agenda.
Even though the opinions about the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how to do in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to act in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to a setting-based model, in the third round, the candidate, who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he candidates, wins in the third round.
Mauritius is supposedly ready to come up with the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, consists of the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority in this percentage of votes.
“Then the two rounds no longer have any sense that this mode would question the entire two chamber concept,” Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would best find it not to add the election order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees to this, even though it is acknowledged that the legislative election order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected largely after the statutes."
"So that no unsense replacement varieties are conceived, as at the last general meeting," said Victoria Plzeň, the owner of the football club, who for the first time candidated and in his comments particularly delimited himself against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
“The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would surely contribute to calming the minds.”
“When football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater,” says Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three Adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more retained.
“I hope an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately twice.”
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Mauritius, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the rules for their own purposes."
"This is why a re-blocking at the general meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that healthy understanding will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree with all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations should allegedly be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generation will be complete until the qualification match at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start at all in Prague in the morning because of a technical disruption, and so feverously searched for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the place of exhibition of the barrage game.
Ultimately, the meeting at the ministerial level is probably crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister of school, youth and body education, would have moved the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to agree.
Indeed, there is a lot on the point: state funding, the confidentiality of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is intended to indicate the new direction of the Czech sport according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is going to fight for the position of President because he does not see appropriate candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, could have made a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have entered the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there was a good appellant, then I would fight for him and refrain from the election."
"But in the current situation it was not able to find such an adept," Paclík ČTK said.
So the main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the function of the Chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the position of Chairman he would have seen an experienced top manager who isn’t too much enclosed in the football events.
“I’ve talked to some people in question personally.”
“Not to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football.
“Such views would have changed,” he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbed Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation who is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes on general assemblies.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta would have the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in Czech football it wouldn't progress at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, is double bad for football," Paclík said.
He also suggested that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearing to investigate a corruption case, but that Pelta was criminal.
"I don't know which prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Šekl Paclík, who said, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta is chairman," but already sees a little left.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, also thinks that he ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go."
"He has great abilities."
"I might be able to imagine him as a head of the national team.
“But I don’t think he’s able to lead the association as a manager.”
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand about," Paclík said in September that he was at the top of Dagmar Damková behind the revocation of the arbitrary commission with Luďek Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he felt the role of the chairman of the association grows.
And inviting his abilities in the management of private companies, he has been head of Pilsen since last summer, which, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League.
“I have the power to change something in the football milieu and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders tending to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which starts up to relentless situations," said Paclík, who does not make an hell from his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relationships between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby with political leaders for more money flowing from lottery tax into the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things that the new president should devote.”
"If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, then they also have to clip and tell clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not consider Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the Chairman of the FAČR must be "over-party".
Pelta is in turn connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“This isn’t just ideal.”
"I think it doesn't make a lot of sense to transfer my shares at the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will unlock a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Chairperson’s Office, namely Miroslav Pelta, that he will strengthen in the event of his election that the FAČR will receive new statutes that will in the future exclude disputes about the election order from the outset.
The official of Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will safely decline in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the gain of funding in the event of his election.
He only decided on the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and he liked the two-month break to help defend his ideas about the management of the football and present in a broader context.
“People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels that it’s time for the association to be led by someone, the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experiences to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today’s problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that ruled at Ivan Hašek’s times.
“Unfortunately, at the General Assembly in June, statutes were approved which were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September,” Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the main document of the Citizens’ Association he used as a locking agent for the delegates.
“If I’m going to be a chairman, then I’m personally assuming it and I’m ready to bear personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not attempt to separate himself from his contractors.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to some success.”
“His attacks were decreasing, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
"Even therefore, many are now doubting about his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations he has expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes to the national team.
And this should be the Czech football sign.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Cause of Bohemians, to the resorts of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Even afterwards, I would be going to negotiate with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," the six-year-old ČTK said two months ago.
Then he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football will not mean human cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said to Strahov, where there is obviously nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the devastating catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
“If really the only controversial point should be how to choose in the third round, then we go over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only be gained back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta continues to be optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association on Thursday, this would allegedly leave the mood to many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relationships with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and otherwise continue the work that previous president Ivan Hašek has started.
"As a president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth.”
"So I don't want to say I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a talk for ČTK.
“I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area.”
And I will spread hard tasks to make football advances in each segment with miles steps.”
"Many wouldn't be just happy about it because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now really have to start working hard," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered no longer candidate at all.
“I know I’m working 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don’t inevitably throw clutches between my legs and question every step I’m taking,” he said as an explanation why he heard.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up because others would do it too."
“This is trust that you cannot play,” he said.
He also supposedly motivates him to continue the work he began under Hašek.
“In two years we managed a big piece of work and I don’t just want to throw it away.”
"There have been started processes that probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just unwill see that they stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are above all people who would make football so that he would only be there for elected people.”
I can be accused of a few things, but not that I would be a party.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone because it's all right for everyone and not just the elected," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he was only a president of the Czechs.
“Even if some people claim the opposite, I really have the intention to do the best for Mauritius.”
“For example, it’s time to consider whether you shouldn’t divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then climb to the first league each.”
“So it couldn’t happen today that only three Moroccan clubs are playing in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Mauritius,” Rajchl said.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not trust to estimate his chances of being elected.
“I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me to be its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” Rajchl said, who also considers the savings of ten million crowns for inadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations about the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself that the association does not draw a single string.
While Pelta says that he is disqualified from first to help Czech football to trust again, he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
“No one can question that he did excellent work in Pilsen in just a year.”
"If he was to be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personal occupation in the commissions would obviously not change it in principle."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favour,” Rajchl judges about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Planchbasins in Ufo-Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels throughout Europe can experience his blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
If Iris Meder went on research in the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to miss: her swimsuit.
Sitting back on the water, she looked highly in artfully designed couples, swimming marble puts waiting for them on the edge of the pool, and stunned over acribically restored youth style swimming halls.
If she was a bath, she took it on flights into her notebook - along with knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and Luxembourg.
The 46-year-old German is a true swimming culture enthusiast.
With sport she didn’t have much on the hat, Meder says - only in water is that different.
It’s troubled that swimming fans with blue cages and chlore stank have to come up while joggers can listen to the disturbing scent of fastener forests or listen to joyful bird witchers in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools really always have to be so ugly,” says the Vienna-living Media.
“So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms.”
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are served, said Meder.
And if the builders have made effort, swimming halls can be a true eye mousse: "If you have a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
“It is, on the one hand, transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything doubles visually: high bows, colourful bowls, jump boards.
On 190 pages, the small-format "Badefreuden" features knowledge worthwhile about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but most of all makes a pleasure to jump into the blue.
Remarkable copies were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent health baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in an urgent carsthave (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Vároz).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor bathrooms in Switzerland and Austria: while the entire city is in the eye from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the ski pit.
Perhaps the most exceptional pool design expects swimming guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upward open bowls, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the oetztal run into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder climbed the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it smells so strongly for heating oil, which one hardly believes to land in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water that is almost black and its slice sticks to a skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a wellness experience of special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing areas: when she wanted to visit the open and sunbath in the Czech Bad Luhatchowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic has now been closed.
When Meder threw a glance through the twittered windows of the red-white-yellow jeunesse style building, she saw how weeds were growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay was counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom behind it; you can discover not only neoromatic elements originating from the times of its establishment in 1844, but also a Mourinho Hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool swimming pool of Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge so many building styles into such a great unit,” said Meder.
In such a palace, the diving walk in the thermal pool is apparently only a next thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank Lets Raw Material Business Light
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the Head of the Group will then draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans find it not acceptable to speculate banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that bets at the global raw material exchanges increase prices – and therefore the banks bear a contribution to the world’s hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is directed towards the German Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the zockers have dissociated themselves from offer and demand - and gain profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business would be "value to play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - along with recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then tell what the consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann battles on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly dramatic how unconsciously banks today harm the general good.”
Ackermann is now in particular the duty as the top banking lobbyist.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
"No matter whether it's Mr. Ackermann about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly at the first glance, but it is clear that the Group Chief wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not switch to the Supervisory Board differently than planned.
With a deviation from the controversial agricultural speculation he could reinforce his image.
And in order for possible losses, he hardly needs to cure himself - that would ultimately have to do with his successor.
Each second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Therefore, just eleven percent consider it to be legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers plants that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would, according to the survey, cancel all investments in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent would abrate acquaintances from such a bank, 49% said to think about terminating their account and switching to another institute.
21st House in Vienna
The moved pavilion
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with heights, depths and happy end: the Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won awards in 1958, was made to the museum in Vienna, standed empty and left.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If the modern post-war architecture is shallowed by clear forms, glass halls, brave silences and new construction materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a famous example for the 1958 Brüssel World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavillon was then the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and sweating steel-glass construction.
The construction is now considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition of Austria.
In 1973, he became internationally famous with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house in Munich.
His pavillon planned as a temporary exhibition was set up in the Swiss World Exhibition Garden at the Vienna South Station, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a 20th century museum - the "20th House" was called it.
However, the building was not spatial and technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art had a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has gone down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavillon, now called it "21er house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday night the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happiness case in every way.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a qualified artistic historian with a significant career among others in the youth as an ice artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Moderne Salzburg, established the reconstruction with politicians and monumental protectors, purchased public resources and private sponsors.
Except for present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same-named foundation, a café and a book store should be built, and an office house had to be built for that.
Strong supervision, small state
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not just because he had remodeled and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavillon was a “enormally important place” for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions “almost every weekend.”
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost generosity and ease in his movement to Vienna and his reuse.
In the current renovation there were much larger problems: the building was "an energy scam," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, used glass fiber-reinforced insulation glass and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbest-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two undergrounds brought space for new use, a reduced light gravel between the house and the street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the lightweight tail pavilion.
The original outdoor doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old red brown rost protection color.
The cinema is exactly exactly as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small state.
"Sometimes it had to be found a material that is good and is cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rugged ground in the ground floor.
Despite all constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion that came from Brussels, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city history".
So an architecture stands “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “raise a right consciousness.”
In this case, however, the 21st house has not been in the wrong place, because it has occurred a city-building happiness case: around the Swiss garden is just the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhof", with offices and residential houses.
And perhaps another lucky case will happen: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, they already negotiated with the city about a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The train has ventilated a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the Deutsche Bahn says that this year more than 70 million euros are supplemented.
The "Bild" newspaper reported earlier with a group's internal crisis plan, investments of around 300 million euros were expected by 2015.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees for snow removal on railway plants and rail climbing to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free railways until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operational needed moves from snow and ice within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube, after a top meeting with government and industry, warned of train failures and delays even this winter.
Last winter, the railways had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Therefore, many new regional trains have been waiting for an approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to test ICE train axles much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE has broken axis at the Cologne main railway station.
Deutsche Bank paid millions of fines in the United States
After the turmoil about Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new trouble from the United States: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fines there.
As if the problems weren’t enough for the Deutsche Bank in the home, the industry giants are now going to get their past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in comparison to solve disputes over the breakdown of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA argues a whole range of large banks to have led the cooperative banks with false promises to purchase financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers were lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and the banks broke into depth.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to take the parties to court," a German bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup who pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Genocide Banks and jumps into Pleiding to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the billions of heavy damage incurred.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pre-buttoned other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
These mortgage papers are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on household loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke down in 2007, this became a range of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers crashed around.
Even though the events have been a few years later, the banks are currently opposing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought countless appeals to obtain repayment or fault.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuit.
She throws 18 international big banks to have overwhelmed the two US state real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions in the volume of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to apply for a FHFA lawsuit, with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand straight for "substantial losses", however, without referring to an accurate sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppably and explained to wish to resist itself.
Warren Buffett Increases 10 Billion to IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests vigorously in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has purchased stocks worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and creates computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knight strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT-urgestone can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed at CNBC that he has purchased IBM stocks worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen into one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said IBM didn’t even know anything about commitment.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett told the strategy.
IBM has been relieving for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice, as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had rather avoided technology firms until now.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for example on a freight railway, on a lubricant manufacturer or machine farmers.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost false sense of money earning has brought him the name "Orakel of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM stock increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and therefore, together with Apple and Microsoft, is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
Buffett said that he doesn’t want to enter Microsoft.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is captivable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurrecting.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000-2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks therefore comes back a deadly-believed ghost: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has no more been comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is foreign fobiality in Germany was never questioned.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology come back up?" title the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that even German authorities could be involved in the right-wing sump.
The Turkish municipality responded to Germany: she reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a warning watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought of a festive act of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish acquisition agreement.
In happy colours, it was staged together - as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fiftyst" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It begins to smell," the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes had been murdered and made a major contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In Turkish internet forums, the action of the police and their later success is discussed critically.
Why didn’t the German authorities have remembered to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to be slapped here, the migrants will remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
“This will probably be the best self-protection.”
"From the goodness of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes Selen.
What does it mean when inner peace in Germany is at risk, the attacks of mulls and solingen in the 1990s clarified.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a captivable threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpen our feeling on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press then, German politics failed after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the burning attack of Solingen, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but he was represented at the grief celebration in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks paid.
The value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germans in the rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive enlightenment and reassessment of terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and ever from one crisis to the next.
Now a German should justify it.
Axel Weber didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was known in July that he would start a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Großbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidity and left friendly comments on the future colleagues.
“The UBS has managed the turnaround.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
But in September, it was clear that everything would happen quite differently.
An UBS dealer in London had surrounded the bank’s all backup systems and dropped around €1.7 billion.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been considered as being struck since then - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been known that Weber is allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic teacher and a banknote and would certainly have needed a time of elaboration.
With a blow he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long deserved the title "Europa’s largest scandal bank".
Because, on the one hand, the UBS is huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and on the other hand, for years, shed from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank remains saved.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the hidden and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, she was introduced to the league of the world’s largest banks as an investment bank.
That made the impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking teacher in Zurich Hans Geiger says: “I’ve always put UBS to my students at the time as a pattern of a good bank.”
“From today’s perspective, you ask yourself, ‘How could I be so wrong?’
He was hugely wrong.
In 2007, for the first time it was revealed that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Board Peter Wuffli retreated surprisingly, who until then was considered as a high-intellectual and equally genial banker.
A few months later we knew why he had gone.
The bank’s investment share had shocked with subprime papers and had to describe billions.
In order to educate this, the UBS announced a capital rise of 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, however, whom some of the nose had stumbled until shortly before: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so hidden that it was not even learned about its name.
But that was only the first hit.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and President Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second-best paid board, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS stood before the collapse in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond that could become the bank’s co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked – because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such big banks.
Finally, UBS 2007’s balance sheet was more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic performance (see graph).
“Once again we couldn’t save the UBS,” says Bankenforscher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to issue the data of wealthy customers who may have taxed with the help of the bank.
She also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and criminal charges.
This allowed the UBS to know more or less openly that it helped in tax removal.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secretity.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chief Executive Board and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to miss speculation and in asset management due to tax removal aid.
And just as it became a little calmer again, just as you thought the UBS will get it again now, so this unfair trader story follows: a single trader is taking €1.7 billion before the bank realizes that something is wrong.
And it is apparent: risk management in investment banking it is obviously not yet working.
“With the Adoboli case, we have to find that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem of UBS is that it doesn’t control risk control.”
It was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had taken up a long time ago to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too big risks, safety for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic had ever liked to collapse the world.
The treasury of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for specially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits to the cliché of the decent Swiss private bank - it is just a little larger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters at Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to the lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are fine, the shop rentals belong to one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble clothes, thick leather chairs are in front of it, next to the bank logo a large sign of the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
The Swiss Bank’s idea has pushed both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has grown too much, he finds it - especially in investment banking, where the Angelsaxes had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say there.
“And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Angels.”
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, earned its high profits and then the deback: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
“On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small Seven Millions of Nations decided to be the largest rescue action in the history of their nation,” writes Lukas Hüste in his book “The UBS Crash.”
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, the politicians granted to save the big bank from the bankruptcy.
How could it happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Switzerland during the merger - and grows further.
It helped the UBS’s two different precursor banks complement: a rich, but sleeping bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poor, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a lot of money that could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, UBS Group Chief, and Marcel Ospel, at the time chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdomen man, who worked up from the bank teaching to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that overwhelmingness came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the leadership meetings, on which Group Chief Wuffli continues to expedite the same word: Goldman Sachs meets from the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
Then the UBS wanted to go up.
A few steps were already successful.
In the foreign exchange and share trading, she played with it at the top.
However, business advisors who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the bank language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost almost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
She became a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgage loans and continued to retain risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
“In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there,” says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS became the slider seat and are wacky to date.
Who leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has missed all remarkable business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to stop investment banking, to focus on asset management, to return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go so far.
But investment banking is going to slow strongly, so much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti will introduce its future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually thought only as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors Grübel.
In the meantime, he has continued: he is intended to run the UBS’s business permanently, Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the mid-1990s.
3500 jobs he ranks.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What do you want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is surely asking itself now.
So far, he just says he will be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken courage to the U.S. investors for the week’s start.
The government change in Athens and Rome remained unbeatable.
The threatening industrial production on the continent shocked the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in germ.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass has yet to be a half-full in the last week, not a half-empty in the last week - but now the problems were pushing on the front, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial values were on the sales boxes.
The Dow Jones index of the default values scored for trading closure with a minus of 0.6% at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer pended between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.

In Frankfurt, the Dax says it was 1.2% with 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is committed to the end of the growth.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office reported.
“We are not island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
This is why it is too early to invest in European state bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett pushed a decade-old principle over the bunch and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional company’s stock rate, and initially rated it almost one percent higher against the trade trend.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece, according to its own statements, and now holds 5.5%.
The share rate of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s sharelines increased significantly with 2.6% more than the market.

At Nasdaq, revenues of 1.38 billion 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 were unchanged.
Intelligent crowns spread in cities
In many places, seeds are considered as "problem birds": however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be removed from cities, experts say.
Some of them like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: crows have been the city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities there are complaints of the dirt and noise of the animals.
There is not yet a means for the "problem birds" yet.
Seed craws were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first craw symposium in the Eastern Frisian empty.
There professionals from the entire federal area consulted about possible outputs.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors also led the problems in cities to the landscape of particularly protected seeds: chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction, and the cases of typical trees made birds life difficult.
Craws are under natural protection.
Great colonies with more than 600 gross pair exist, among other things, in the Westphallic Soest, in the northwest, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, there had been a controversial project for the massive killing of craws in the district of negative slots.
Criticians had called the catching of animals in birdfalls and the killing with knots as particularly brutal.
“The normal expulsion, the burial, brings nothing,” said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests with water sprays or trees falls often have unwanted consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg also said.
“The animals dissipate, large colonies split into and spread elsewhere.”
Burial can only be considered as an exception to hospitals, age homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we won’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surrounding land, the problem in cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner aus Leer.
It can be thought of a combination of burials of animals from sensitive living areas and locking offers to reset them elsewhere.
In contrast, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens wrote for a completely different deal with the animals: "A pickle in the face we can ultimately bear best self-confidently."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens founded the Ascheberger Krahen-Teaching Path, on which signs inform the lives of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skills of the animals are legendary: seed craws use not only tools to come to a taste, but even make their tool itself as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seed crabs on how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they need to crash a crack to get to a moth larve.
Without a lot of training, they recognized the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the piffing craws then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically installed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a mother larve.
The birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had given them wire pieces.
From it all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then hunted the cover on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds succeeded even in annex.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal in 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are at EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th) Portugal hit Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM part in a row perfect after 0:0.
The Czech play-off back at the outsider Montenegro was 1:0 (0:0), after the game (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Nothing else left Croatia to burn at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved further hits for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga Professor Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed tradefmeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo hunted a free shot of about 30 meters for the early leadership in the mesh.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-schushing qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by torj hunter Edin Dzeko.
The former wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the gateway (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Then arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack on hero Postiga in the Bosnian criminal room, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the Yellow Card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who safely transformed Misimovic.
However, after the break, the vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the final doubts in the 81st minute.
The European Championships from 1976 to EM for the fifth consecutive time.
The team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legioners Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a fearful second in the beginning.
Finalman Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the criminal space boundary just just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crosslate had to rescue the Czech world-class gateway already beaten, again the FC Seoul striker had removed (50th).
The gate shortly before the end made everything clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb’s football wonder.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hiddink has to take his place on the World Cup’s Third Bank of 2002 as safely, the Croatians can be excited for their fourth participation in an EM end.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost seized a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met only the foot with a distance shot, the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't sink the remover in the gate.
After the scary second, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who placed the 62th minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni travels to EM
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made the 4:0 success in the match for a preliminary decision in the 32st minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar to the guests.
Ireland pressed at speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23th minute before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian background prevented the possible leadership strip.
In the 32nd minute, it was all right.
After a defeat of finalman Pavel Londak, Ward was at the point and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
In the coming years, Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China and wants to almost double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to be funded, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
The employment is expected to grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are sitting in the Boomland.

Currently, the software provider, who employs 55,000 employees worldwide, runs as much as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Emotional and generously begins Peter Englund’s new book “Beauty and Terror. A story of the First World War, telling in nineteen fates” with a long list of main persons going to one’s heart.
Here is a tip on how to do: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main persons will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you lost like Englund's men and women in the mist of the war and are stolen from your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, designated the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he doesn’t incorrectly describe as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few large names, important contracts, or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about " feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
“Beauty and terror” means almost 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanists to mountain riders, doctors, ambulances and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the voting candles in a church, some add, while others erase.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Westfront.
"Beauty and Terror" wandering with expert views on other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bees cards, a Christmas celebrated among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetseflies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and listens to gunfire in the distance. Stay or take away?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what happens or why this war is going on at all.
"Failing facts," says Englund, "was furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship matrix.
Their stories were primarily taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Your life reports may be frightening or captivating, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the small moments that are losing in detail.
Many of them act of deficiency and help.
In the story of a German school girl, he tells: "Replace, everywhere replace."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminium, wrong radiator rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells us more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Flesh made of pressed rice and baked in hamlet fat (and lastly served with a fake bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were needed with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food replacement, which were allowed in the manufacturing of sausages, 511 registered coffee replacement."
Some stories act of honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own desire for wildlife and says about the war: "You feel that despite all that it was intended for men rather than to sit in the leather chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a whiskey in hand, and so doing, rather than doing such a facade meant civilization, and there is no barbarity behind his own."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and no one will take a note or take care of it.
“When you take a distance from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that is happening before a public,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations act from the old Europe that falls apart, and about new kinds of terror.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between the factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass killers in the dimensional suit that slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen manner and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostitute with a gender disease in order to escape the front service.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonocock eggs, because soldiers bought and smelted into their genitalia, hoping to go to the hospital,” he wrote.
Those who were really desperate screwed him in the eyes, leading to them to be blind for the rest of their life.
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes tasty and yet unintrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war “uncovered incontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start wondering why their leaders are going to fight them.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted as Paul Fussell’s Great War and Modern Memory or novels like Erich Maria Remarques “In the West nothing new” than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end I have ever read of in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's as if he'd grabbed us with his book this page with the main persons from the nose and lighted with a wood.
After an early mistake, a carefully planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in this, some of them were wearing action helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday because at that time there are hardly people in the Zucotti Park.
The surgery was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed, and all others believed to participate in an exercise initially.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks such as the introduction of pepperspray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Desert and gave the householders a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to be repeated.
The police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise took place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training – measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was held on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute," someone who was familiar with the commands said what a declaration said as "exercise".
“The few policemen who were involved in my knowledge didn’t know it’s about the Zuccotti Park,” someone said wanting to remain anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort.”
One reason for confidentiality was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clean the park, but returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including commands of operations from the whole city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually employed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day many people enter and out in the park, almost like pendlers, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stay in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready in front of the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that shouted from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their bright blue windjacks, many protesters simply refined their things and left the place.
The police said no tents would be taken until 1:45 p.m. to give the protesters time to pack their property together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the surrounding area to intervene, arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said that this was happening to their own security.
But many journalists say they were to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said the dealings of the officials were very rude.
Browne said that television cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved towards the west through the great disturbance of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags in clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning that raised what had been left.
Some protesters who refused to leave were taken outside, pictures of this appeared shortly later on the internet.
A major core of protesters referred to position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some barriers were built and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are linked to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Catastrophe protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The house was completed after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to “unfair behaviour and resistance to an arrest.”
The most prominent officer on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformized officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “led not the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In the event they had to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how police from these locations continued to extend the surroundings around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 a.m., a protester left south of the Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the quantity threw a piece of blockwood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of the guardians will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, who represents hundreds of school managers who have lost their job last month, plans to prosecute the city on Wednesday as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The appeal is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school aids, care coordinators and other employees who belonged to the city's worst paid employees and lost their work in a chess track on 7 October, the trade union leader had described as a political revenge for the city's access to a health fund that the working groups had held in the household.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing by the City Council, school director Dennis M. Walcott said last month, the dismissals were part of the budget that they adopted in June.
A member of the city council returned and told him that in the budget nothing specifics that employees would be dismissed from school aid.
The officials of the 37 City Council said they had and warned the Ministry of Education from a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the submission of the lawsuit to the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be held by Mr. Walcott and the city’s Ministry of Education as accused and count eight dismissed workers as claimants who are all colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the Department of Justice of the City, said that the city would not charge the lawsuit and thus its individual claims could not be commented.
According to a New York Times draft complaint, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality, claiming that the poor schools had lost more helpers as they were chronicly underfunded.
She explains that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aids in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 aids were dismissed in the 8 and 9 districts in South Bronx.
With the foundation of the loss of five out of eight students who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of students live in poverty, the appeal states: "This is not neighborhood of dumb parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district’s budget was shortened by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra-financing for any arm school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led to mistake in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) usually describes the shift of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," the draft appeal states.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree about Libya
Ultimately, it seems like Republicans and Democrats in Washington have already talked about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides on a resolution undertaking President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been simply in the Libya debate so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the choice of a series of resolutions to approve or abuse the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain issued a resolution that approved the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad edge group of both parties and no vote was made.
However, on the same day this law was enforced in the Senate, and the Chamber approved a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
This turned the U.S. mission into a kind of legislative firefire - with a Congress that, although was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally remove his ground under his feet.
Then the Congress’s uncertainty was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and exceptional endurance in their self-release" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislators as the June law did?
The last version focuses on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the leading republican of the Committee.
Lucas spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is at the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congress legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have unsuccessfully tried to vote their changes, although they have tried enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to the Congress and includes a wide range of topics.
Some are twice - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others differ slightly from each other.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of compensation budget amendments and a dozen more that would control federal expenditures.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially with the beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the possibility to boast that they have such a measure "written".
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to revoke the limit to two offices of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage among equals is a recurring template, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states refuse to repeal the laws.
As eager as members suggest changes, they move faster as in recent years.
At the 111st Congress, the legislators introduced 77 such amendments. at the 110st Congress 66.
The pace fails compared to that in the early 1990s when members regularly suggested more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords says in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot her from nearby distance during a Tucson election event, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) took place on national television Monday evening, singing alone for the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover is greater than the one returning to the congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", she ranked by words and needed help in walking.
The shipment showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the ball, which divided its skull, drilled through the left side of its brain, and has crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the assassination in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – and described her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered, "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the release of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the assassination of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you see her in the hospital bed, with a boiled head shaved and a long shell over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nick with your head.
A suck with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords flirts another word: "Toast", she wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford’s recovery: You see how Congress members sing together with the therapists of Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” and Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’”.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she cannot remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords on March 12 an article of a daily newspaper about the assassination when she stopped him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is compulsoryly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, didn’t you have been defeated?’,” Kelly said.
You were only hit.
And you will go through that, and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applaud.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in the spring.
A rank military officer on the Gala watched, among other things, by the Stab Head and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not, it was compassion.
The crazy contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcome with praise for their victims.
But praise has its prize, say servants.
The public behaves increasingly as it did people in uniform suffering.
“We were no victims at all,” brigade General Sean B. MacFarland said, who commanding troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to press ourselves into the role of unfortunate souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear unthankful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger struck against the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a consequence, discussions about compassion are held between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear as they were defeated by rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "angerous, violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a higher state post after his return in Washington.
During his work search, he said, he felt that some of the questionnaires subtlely asked whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
“When you speak about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Performance on the battlefield is considered by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely as praise.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said General David Barno, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military stands on the growing pressure to attack hard in rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in rape before the military court.
If it is not possible, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her Miramar cars north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer with herself.
He asked if he could accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells were going on," Lyman said.
But the Texanian was aside of her concerns.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
“I wish I had listened to my belly feeling.”
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they have raised against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not proceed against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 defendants who increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by colleagues, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or proper lawsuit.
Burke says she follows the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically built,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in position to eradicate the culture retaliation of the leadership?"
Burke also says she has contacted almost 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all applicants to put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team for the Ministry of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a request to reject a lawsuit.
The cases of the court, which are present in the Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused of injuries by current or former soldiers to which it has come into the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court of the 1950s, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries to soldiers in the active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the applicants," the document said.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat actions.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: there are three other complaints besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic prepares a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a women’s enemy atmosphere.
The non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America independently appeals against the military focusing on the diagnosis of “personal disturbance” that received rape victims to release them from the service – a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e., administration of war veterans) in which she prepared her discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for people who claimed being sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted independently to the Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of points.
In 2010, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e., Office for Sexual Prevention and Reporting) of the Department of Defense reported 3,158 sexual abuse.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this number takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that come to a year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the rates of law enforcement: in 2010 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, just half as many as in civil law.
The claimants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first one of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker from a cut on her arm was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listed by a judge, and during this hearing she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator who was ultimately released.
“I still remember the day when the judgment was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the birth hurt would be used. I ran out of the courtroom screamingly."
“They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out, I told my commander, ‘That was not his procedure, that was my procedure.’”
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unable to serve.
In January 2010, she was dismissed unhonoredly, so she won't receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other claimants filed is moving forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, “I think they should move forward.”
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that is criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military goes a decade after, because they do not possess the same incentive and disgrace that brings liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms occur," she said.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to have committed an emotional race in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack in front of his computer and shaded with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social network pages.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how can you find them?
This is easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
“We found it was not difficult to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report of the British DEMOS idea factory on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the website’s advertising tool to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or dietary product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which they asked about their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 followers from 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries – without having to leave their office once.
“It’s a pretty new research method,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online right-wing supporters are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising turn, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study everything, from health issues to societal trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, Facebook's "Datensupernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works named this page in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is the fact that you can study people through this page that you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the road.
“When you’ve been trying to interrogate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“They had to first inform the party and they would never have given them access,” Bartlett says.
“At Facebook, that’s all gone away – you’re going directly to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full break on Facebook tend to drunk more significantly than students who silenced on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, for example residential advisors, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author and head of Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle at the Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify threatened children who would not have been found otherwise.”
Facebook is also constantly applying the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a national happiness index (which were primarily used information that only Facebook has access - masters of digital freedom know for a long time that the site should make its large data background available for other research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the site watches them, whether they want it or not, and to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you’ll let the site expedite your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have at all thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociolog at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
It is impossible on Facebook to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Kalt and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood in two footsteps in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a template in Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I stand up against the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because this supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the laws, but I don’t confess myself guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog as he “wanted not to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views.”
For the same reason he denied Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, the permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of his hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks that he has no access to the media for four weeks, and he said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind the castle and thread.
All participated with the goal that everything goes away.
"I thought he looks cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian NRK broadcast.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it's going on a bit after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue cravat and looked quiet and professional during the entire hearing, watching journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he would have had complicits.
It may be liked that the attacks of 22 July were apparently the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looks like a monster, but he doesn't," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting technology as a great modern inventor.
What Apple’s fans may find most discovered job interview, which was drawn away this week before special movie demonstrations on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who eagerly based on diagrams - a man who believed many managers suffer from "a sickness of thinking," "that makes a really great idea of 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft between a great product and a great idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringly developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialist Idiots" about the emergence of the personal computer, and he sat together with jobs for more than an hour, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that point, 10 years have passed since jobs were pushed out of Apple, and he has already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after Job’s death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised movie material is the basis for the 68-minute movie "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, Jobs appears here surprisingly eagerly in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Throughout the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds thinking in which jobs clearly devastate their thoughts and strive to accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to date when he seems to be impatient to respond to Cringly’s questions and pushes him up to take care of more important topics or side-actions.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview appears somehow ashamed when Jobs evaluate what other companies do correctly or wrongly and represents their own vision of the computer’s future.
It’s one thing to read posthumous career jobs’ worthwhile, but to see jobs here as the desired dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Soon after he had done all this here, he pulled away and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to manage a company:
"While in the business all the years I always ask, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, so it's easily done.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, no one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Blooming how costs were recorded - most often they started with "standard costs", which were counted on mere assumption and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope was overwhelmed:
Jobs tells him about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could enter the telephone company and lead remote talks for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but Jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a charged phone, making a call, and then connect from an AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things around the globe a half a dozen times and when you came to the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs says.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control trillions of dollars to infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be without Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost dropped from when they wanted to call and talk to the pope in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican while they were able to follow Henry Kissinger as well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and calling him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, he received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever manufactured.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the assembling and delivery of finished devices.
Later with Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember broader arguments... They shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that decrease:
Long before he left Apple resurviving, Jobs predicted the ways so many industrial gigants came into Stolpern with their visions and lost control over their shares.
“Do we say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copier or printer, naked and?”
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product engineering that has led to this monopoly position is needed by people who have no concept about good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times greater if Microsoft could have been in the 1990s.
They caught the defeat of the victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
“It’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your finesses.
You have to make votes, certain things you cannot, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond that you try to get rid of the best things that people have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clash.
We are always shameless in the stealing of great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there, musicians, poets, artists, zoologs, historians who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically sharing question of whether you will listen to a dispute of President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to advise on the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a law appealing 26 states against the widespread reform of health care, which was decided last year by Congress, which became a keyword for conservative activists all over the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic division is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the presidency fight in 2012, which will be in full run at the time the court decision will be announced.
The lawyer who stands in court and will claim that the law is to be hit will probably be Paul Clement, once prosecutor-general under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-dining group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that disputed the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical manager Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had advised the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republicans’ Senate, and an explained opponent of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are free from the Code of Behaviour, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the Code 4c principle, which states: "A judge can participate in benefit events of nearby and other organisations, whereas the judge may not be a spokesman, honor guest or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it to alarm moral and government activists.
“This stunning fracture with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lies, the court keeps the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a citizen rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dine during a benefice event with lawyers with floating proceedings in the court."
Your appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermine all rights to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas demonstrate little consideration of critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor-general under the Obama administration when the first bill disputes came in court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for prejudice, as she was too involved in the defence of the law to be unprejudiced.
Kagan doesn’t make any instances to do this.
Boeing draws a record order of 18 trillion dollars to land
Emirate orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 other aircraft.
Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than a trillion dollars.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order of over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big business when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is at a record sum of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
On weekends, Boeing announced its biggest order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
In 2011, Boeing announced that the airline also has an option to purchase 20 other aircraft that will increase the entire list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s exchange professional.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are in possession of oil producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“You have a natural security,” he said.
The order of Emirates reaffirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-space aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitor SAS in chess, who attacks the A350's leadership position.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus announced it would be shifting the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was delayed to gain more confidence after customers had requested a higher load of use and reach.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President’s sister seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in the race around the Governor's posts.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traders had influenced the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race around the governor positions in the western state.
“The intervention of the organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday’s day is alarming not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... They have occupied election cabins, built street blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, which had led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate to her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current Governor, came to the third place, a serious defeat for the split and unfortunate left leadership for the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug traffickers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon’s homeland and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still lasts.
A PAN citizen master was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates were out of fear from the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how contradictory the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who probably represents the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will leave us to look bravely next year."
ADB urges Asia to assist in the rescue of the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term decline trend that will break the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world have to do “all in your power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned from the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look “unsufferingly” at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all sitting in the same boat.”
"So anyone can help Europe from this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
“If China and India can help, then with all the means.”
The European Monetary Union has become a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe causes fears that the global economy could drop into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries should join together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support for Asia will be channelized by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiation power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and drilling foreign capital flow.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that evolving economies such as India have no motivation to help rich Europeans when they face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the American Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of $2 or less living a day.
"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks are 50 years old to go in pension and spend holidays on the beach, then you have a problem," he said.
Similarly, Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, asked why Indian reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs poorly managed, losses such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast with an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of degradation” due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets should create “crisis plans” to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warned on Monday that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, thus resolving a financial chain reaction from Pentagon’s halls to the war seats in Afghanistan and the civil flowbands.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but is afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress cannot achieve a conclusion in the expenditure.
“The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unthinkable manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unperformable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and harm other modernization efforts seriously," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also have been forced to separate ourselves from a majority of our civilian personnel involuntarily, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a confined probability in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alarm readiness.”
The cuts were finally hit the fighter troops,” said Panetta.
"While the war time contingents in the anti-terror struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would harmly affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
“Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in settings and settings supervision that support the war.”
“The staff’s salaries would be shortened, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disturbed.”
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of the Defence Ministry’s seizure would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are vigorously against this draconic act,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result we cannot live with, and it’s certainly none that we should be pushed up.”
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen claims to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, remains expected.
Panetta has expressed the potential cuts increasingly unblooded, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget at Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing heavy choices.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what might be upcoming - a military with a shell, but without a core.
“It’s a ship without sailors.”
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air gun without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of the caserns, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech in Pentagon.
“It’s a military that lacks morality and alarm willingness and that is unable to grab it with potential opponents.”
"It makes a person actually angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global engagement and capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects of the elimination could be victimized, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarine, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step towards arms so that possible dangers could be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Declare a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how contemplative and widespread deception and lie are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the lord of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides of lies against each other.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of falsehood because it was allegedly retained reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed towards U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congress member and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became fool when he denied circumstances that were very quickly rejected by improper evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of the campaign financing that is related to the crackdown of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that has triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term at the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shedding in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers provided their students with the examination responses to allow them to stand well even during their performance audits.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and bumps are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
But many of these lies are considered as lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize or "discover lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far away from a social game such as sharades in which the goal is to call "have yourself!", the detargeting of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at highly prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of physics and psychology.
One result of research is that most old myths have been discovered about lies.
Lies are looking in your eyes.
They're stubbing, stamping, redding, and not always shaking.
But it is not possible to conclude that these liars are difficult to discover and discover.
An exercised liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim that the fine expressions of the face, about questioning and timing.
I’ve spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of deprivation, and it’s clear that the deprivation of a deception is a modern ability to learn that is easy and helps us to be entitled in our complex world, especially when the setting or questions of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibility.
Good liars are very good in assessing others whose interest is raising and mastering their own emotions, and they feel intuitively as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extrovert people lie more often than introverted people that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - generally they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell me)
We also know that when one person has been dismissed as a criminal, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone lies?
First by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the vocal quality of your experimental person.
You should better know when someone usually constantly trippels with the foot, so they don’t wrongly accuse him when he trippels with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of notable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that crawl, not as evidence of decargation.
People who deceive perhaps stirred when trying to remember their story. Perhaps they stand their feet towards the door, or they stand towards the output, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing exhaustion and change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioners often mistakenly signal that a setting interview has passed, only to keep looking after this relaxation after the setting interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson’s rubbish is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceitful people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a difficult question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as much as I know ... according to their best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than in fact, which often leads to alarm clots.
There is no sorcerer to discharge lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which discharge is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less rarely a victim of deceivers, both in private and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan is revised after risk by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions are annoyed and at the same time calming environmental protectors, the pipeline building companies are trying to replan the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said the company continues to be confident that the pipeline is finally approved, although with a different course.
This came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be delayed until the new possible course to review the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogalla-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may delay a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials denied that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets they love because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, Nebraska’s legislators, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The recent study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the principal auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant by Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a child from fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle had gotten a tobacco attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would make her little daughter so scared that she passed herself out of fear.
The Lady Marmalade singer's tire made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard with his luggage and Genevieve on his arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle advised the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive sound, 'You shouldn't put your daughter down near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
I told her, "I don't care what you're saying or thinking."
She became angry and began to shame - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pull water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was becoming hysterical.
"I told this woman, 'See what you did to my daughter,' the child's mother said.
LaBelle dropped to the mother who still wore Genevieve on his arm, and had to be held back by her accompaniment and drawn to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby shouted so much that it had to go over, she said.
Later, the family LaBelle asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which they requested an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an uncertain damage compensation, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he did not invoice any honour and plans to give the family the money they receive to the child’s cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed against a kindergartener on the day that wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm.”
Climate Difficulties Break Economy
In the first year when Mario López Valdez was in the government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments dropped and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, it is the first year when Mario López Valdez referred to himself as the initiator of change, and shed great hopes for economic growth in the government. However, as a result of climate disturbances, growth cannot be talking about, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy, causing a general decrease in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decrease in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which has brokenly affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land used were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55.053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, equivalent to the first quarter, which corresponds to 74 percent of the employment population, from July to 6,28 percent, and in the second quarter.
Lower liquidity
Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments on the unemployment of the policy of public institutions, which indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, among others liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts of the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the Congress, because for those who prohibitedly accumulate dollars, it is not easy to allow them to work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also lives in a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the country seeking work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined; this is due, on the one hand, to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and seek work here, which makes unemployment increase,” he said.
black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which includes 60.38 percent of the country’s employees working without paying into the social insurance cases.
Unemployment and black labour are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Agency) and the Secretariado del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexico Government for Labor and Social Care).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and growing unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the past ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía, the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, which is 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period.
The Secretariat de Desenvolvement Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) on the other hand has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, primarily from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July, which should be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The state congress approved a amount of 200 000 000 pesos, but until November it could not be found any positive impact of the debt on any of the country's industries.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first government year Mario López Valdés made it apparent to the government incapacity.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of the processing industry in Mexico) declared that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the country government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be hard worked to regain the land lost this year and we have to strive twice in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well united government team have not been sufficiently aligned with each other," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year complicated and slowed down the country’s economic development.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently in motion to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will complete the year far below our expectations,” he said.
Redefining appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederation Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Entrepreneur Association) in Sinaloa, stated that the state must be arranged for more dynamic productive activities.
“In general, we have observed that work has been worked. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redetermine the country’s economic appeal and line, because it’s important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa,” he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex emphasized the importance of developing a future perspective that will drive the government’s efforts in better paths.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current government has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that it has been working and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work in front of it," he said.
Detention for 8 kg marijuana
An inhabitant of Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic’s prosecutor’s office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health – here possessed by marijuana for trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military in monitoring Cipriano Valdez road against guard post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato on June 7, 2010.
The drug dealer drove in a white cart in which he kept a black bag in a box in the cart and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight pounds and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the conquered goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the execution institution.
Debt for construction work
Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 social buildings for migrants are at risk of not being completed because of the lack of resources or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Authority for Social Development said that, although construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger because the government has not paid the funds that it has given for the three programmes that exceed 11 million pesos.
He said that the overall investment in these three programmes amounts to nearly 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state, until now only the Federation and the municipality would have taxed funds to the construction works, which is why a delay in the construction termination should be expected.
“12 million have to contribute, and although the year is over, they didn’t give us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us some part in July,” he said. “In order not to be too late, we’ve already started the construction work, and they’re already advanced, but we need the money.”
He stressed that under the Government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not met its obligations, which is why the municipality had to earn a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its government, which was the amount the central government had to pay.
"This has been the way for us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, and the programs continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not applied to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the government authorities were required to pay for these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate the administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Nearly 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is over, they didn’t give us a penny.”
Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The change of analogs to digital signals is one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) returned the constitutional cases submitted by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidency, and by virtue of which the transfer of analogs to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be transferred due to the lack of eight votes required for legislation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the law decree with details on the transfer to the digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court can decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so that the law remains in force.
In the project for the appeal drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the law decree for unconstitutional, since the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) is responsible for regulations relating to radio and television, which is why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and legislation.
The project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed complaints against the legislative decree; after the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the legislative decree and introduced all activities for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council also rejected the appeal filed by the House of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
She also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for the planning of the independence of the regulatory body.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred around the world in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality, and more channels.
The expulsion of the conversion, she said, is an expulsion of the benefit of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it is economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, “made the action of the entire system required, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the State, they included a group of characteristics that the Constitution puts into the hands of the central government.”
She recalled that many countries worldwide had already done the digital change, which is the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government, with the issue of the disputed legislative decree, is mature in the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative would be complied with.
The possibility of individually counting the vote lists in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the Governor is about 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of a single count of the vote list is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the Governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 still not counted.
In this sense, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that last November the electoral body had adopted a series of rules on the harmonization of local rules with the reforms of states in election matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of election. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel lost their publication in the state indicator within the deadlines provided for that, with the argument, nor to object.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional appeal filed by the local legislative and judged the vote of the State Representative on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to "decide or make a veto against it".
In an interview, María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could partly or completely count the vote list.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more vote packages may be partly counted The results in the protocols do not agree; the vote counting and calculation Protocol is not actually preceded or is not in possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
Furthermore, the total counting of the fully completed voting certificates may be carried out if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is on the second place that is equal or less than one percent, provided an explicit request of the party-both coalition chairman is presented at the beginning of the meeting, the second of the mentioned candidates.
The vote count may also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an express request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in this case, the election packages, which were excluded from a partial count.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took down this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace, and on Monday the Dead Shows and a Dead Trade Fair took place.
According to family members, the ultimate will of the Lieutenant was that his ashes were spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others killed in the accident in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, who participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the noon, the ashes of Lieutenant Superior landed on the mourning hall, located at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 17.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Technological Institute of Saltillo, which led to this body view by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Abitur.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot’s sister.
From her perspective, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he had remained in the plenty of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and son, a loving brother and he was always involved in his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it because they thought it would even go on a truck, yet he always sought to accomplish his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome him the whole family, as with the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had traveled to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A last farewell
Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honor granted him the people and government, the Mexican army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flyed by him, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority, died.
At 18.05 a.m., the insected remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be passed on to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and teachers, were expected.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military members presented eleven people arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found by shots in different body parts and a grace shoot in a abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the mileage point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several proceeding people saw that the door of the land house surrounded by a beige-brown wall arose throughout the blockade.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow shirt and dark pants without shoes; next to him was another dressed with a white top.
Almost a meter away, the body of another person was with red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information obtained on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place because no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house, there are writings that one organized criminal band writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a crime who was mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were initially arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estate and a phone were guaranteed. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military troops found a car with two prisoners on their watch round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m., one of her companions in the municipality of La Frauda was arrested, who attempted to escape at the sight of the military.
They will be charged with secret burials in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to imagine the new government to offer the front of the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic breakdown.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to imagine the new government to offer the front of the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic breakdown.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm government formation.
It is assumed that it will introduce a majority of technocrats composed cabinet, although it is not clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalist.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but from his comments, the obstacles are overcome.
“The framework is now well put down,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard savings package requested by europoliticians in order to regain trust in Italy.
The pressure to the hurry on Monti was still increasing due to the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian state bonds were loaded for 10 years with 7% of interest, corresponding to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Confindustria Association, told the press after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government in all the forces.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Success opportunities for Montis were significantly enlarged by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, who had to resign as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to bring good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Middle Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of technocrats-consistant government, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying the reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has noted that a Montis failure is a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began on Monday with debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurship associations, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday night the meeting round is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After briefly breathing at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would withdraw, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of the Italian bonds have reached critical boundaries.
A rescue of Italy with a debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said his government must take until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politicians into his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, indicating their concerns in regard to the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disputes between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Out of the 22 players from Spain, ten over 50 international games have on the bucket.
From Costa Rica’s pages, only one of the 22 invited 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22th for the Friendship Game, which is held today at 15.05 a.m. at the National Stadium of San José, is compared to players from both countries.
While the world and Europe champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back at a significant number of selection games of Class A, the three-colored team only has the only defense player Michael Umana with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs in the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (liga and cup) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish Fury will be made at the complicated Eurocup and World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, however, have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rank below.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the gateway Iker Casillas, who on Saturday reached an equality with the former gateway Andoni Zubizarreta on England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 abroad games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's middle stormman, Raúl González, with 102.
The number 100 is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He followed Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left-handed Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the 45-handed Bryan Ruiz.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of the games.
Less than 30 games have at the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team comes to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn’t even approach the 20th boundary.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Eder Nelson have not yet debuted.
Spain’s historic gate guard is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres at 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett enrolled Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence
“To play in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true.”
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts at the national stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was insured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will appear at the National Stadium from 19.30 a.m. along with the Los Angeles and Las Robertas band.
You are reading an extract from the conversation whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Do you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realised for us too.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've been on vacation only once in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you because the fans of the band are completely devoted. You will experience the days before the concert more intensely.
What do you say of your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing alongside us all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry we took so long until we arrived here.
Some people even think your concert will become the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t this take a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have launched in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on a few huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unthinkable.
My friends have always driven surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas for surfing are. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any boundaries.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we’ll play each is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have no longer played in the repertoire, we can keep our concentration better and surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, so also for the audience.
With this tour you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing in a great rock band once, and that for over 20 years, it looks like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world we always wanted to visit.
Things might not stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Once again a band comes out of a city, but it’s already unusual if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We look forward to being still friends with them and we honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands have survived.
First of all, I think we all appreciate ourselves happy to be still alive and also take care of each other.
We are all narrow friend, which is why musical ways have opened up, giving every individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't get better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up made us easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be on tour too often because it’s too easy to fall out this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of the music, this reminds you that you have to take attention to the music and what they have launched without saying to be a famous rock star, which has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have about your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) death.
We were disappointed about having taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or pictures, I remember what was for an incredible man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work and laugh music together.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter’s text when you play live?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, I don’t know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that remembers him.
Who was you influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
The first ones I think are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I liked all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion show?
I think we don't all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
Initially her music was darker, now she’s more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could look somewhat lightly, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they have some positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing. They're very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life—e.g. losing a family member or a friend—that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodies this for me.
But I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori went to hospital again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was introduced to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his house physician said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his rule (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, who operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congress member and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be investigated for three days at the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Diseases Neoplasticas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he believed that Fujimori could be merciful for humanitarian reasons, but nevertheless he did not wish that because he believed him is innocent.
He has been operated four times in tongue cancer and has lost 18 pounds of weight, including severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Direction Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army’s death schadron, who was secretly operating during his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official arrangement, led by Uruguay’s President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, launches its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the region’s political topics.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón, which will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the town of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the presidential office of the South American country announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica looked for Calderón’s support as to the incident with France, when French leader Nicolas Sarkozy at the G20 summit in the French town of Cannes put the South American country on a list of tax paradise.
In his discussion, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still occur as tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairman of the G20 since November, a group consisting of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double expectation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the concretization of tax exchange agreements in order to be removed from the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
Since 2004, there is a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The nut installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been tired of fighting for the saving of Princess Peach from the cloves of the evil bowser for 25 years, but until now he has never been in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he has been fighting for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month to the store stands of all the world has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special three-dimensional glasses.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Nintendo-specialised press in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that Super Mario 3D Land was Nintendo’s first video game that has been developed for this console from the beginning, because to date successful articles such as “Star Fox 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D” have been adjusted to existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is a “affordable” video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less shocked users.
Afterwards, experts can turn a “second round” on the different game levels, which becomes increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the “optical effects” must always be played in three dimensions.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has no longer been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks the fans of the saga and repeats the success recipe of the latest editions: The nut installer needs to overcome dangerous platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player focuses on news in the movements, the environment, the coats and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
Guatemala’s President, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would accept the delivery of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible for the conspiracy in the United States for the washing of $70 million.
Thus, the trial on the U.S. request for the delivery of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He emphasized that he did not interfere with court decisions during his government and accepted all requests for extradition that he was notified.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to condemn the former Staaat President (2000 - 2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation is cleared in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the suppression of 120 million quetzales in the Department of Defense during his government period, and this negotiation anticipated the delivery, but the Minister made opposition and revived the case again.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was initiated to avoid marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of age of the social aid organization Trinijove has led to important results: 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, have been supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, with more than 300 people participating, was drawn balance sheet.
Trinijove was launched in Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu has participated in numerous responsible for institutions and institutions that have worked together with the association in these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives from different directions in campaign times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generality (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large Fabra i Coats Hall also visited the current Catalonian Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Sparkasse La Caixa Social Works, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he emphasized that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation.”
For the President of the Generality, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulties.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he performs,” he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were organized was spared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 have found an end on Balmes street.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they held illegally and organized huge festivities that led the neighborhood to despair.
After cleaning, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply with them, and had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days, driving the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, said Europe Press had declined her business by 80% since the start of the household occupation.
The owner of the discography pointed out that the householders made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks at three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discography.
Furthermore, the owner of the recreational site was shown by the neighbors for rest disorder, while, according to her statement, the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the householders and, in particular, the guests of the festivals organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became increasing and longer in recent weeks.
The discotheker said the harassment was so large that it agreed with the owner of the building that it did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that in recent weeks she received more complaints from neighbors.
Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for immediate cleansing the building and tackling the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downturn of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but that in recent months the householders were entered into all floors of the building and almost all apartments, in some it had even come to thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and attack the Asocial acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleaned by the Catalonian police.
At 15:30 a.m. the police approached Montral Street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes on honorary fees, agree with the tender.
The city tender over the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the highlight of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its dismissal writing on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again to the upper border of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (hills) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
Now it was no longer an example of the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of yogiber.
As far as the city was expenditured a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
It is either so, or someone is planning to put doors on the land.
The question asks itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational perspective, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the theme of conversation in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old cast, which meet in the elevator, can resort to.
And precisely this fact offers the fabric for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have announced the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, it is necessary to speak over the "front on the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been held over the green apples.
“One should come from the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things because it is quite accessible.
Collserola is more complex, judges the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" has a "lexical trap": it cannot be imagined "as access to a park, but as limiting areas where it must be traded."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with city-building experience, considers the proposal as a “intellectual challenge” which poses “some dangers” in itself.
Hazards resulting from the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swarming song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is your own limitation to what is to be constructed.
“To limit something means always to set the next step,” i.e. to go beyond it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the General Plan Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which keeps closer to the question, simplifies the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that doesn't towards Barcelona" for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola that should not "shock on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the municipal administration that it gave his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notices that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the travel letter that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "two" techniques on whether this technical profile should lead "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the tender terms a global view of Collserola fails: "There have been written 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entire."
At least in his case, this has led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt throughout its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red freed the brother of Mayor of Monterrey from the trial led against him because of suspected depression.
After 72 days of captivity, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after the authoritative representative of the Casino Red forgive him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for depression.
After the assassination on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is supposedly forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
According to the criminal charge, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistic mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo Barrio of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second detention order, after the official of the Ministerio Público rejected the offences for kidnapping and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta’s prison facility because he had allegedly beaten the owners of the Red Casino with an and a half million pesos, while he remained only a few hours in the middle-security tract, as death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as a prison officer of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, was issued a detention regulation, which noted that after the investigations lasting almost two months, Jonas was sufficient to blame for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open this in exchange.
On Monday, the authorized representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, Mayor’s brother, to put the penalty for himself in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez asked whether he solved the damage and who the owner of the betting house pronounced his forgiveness, but the lawyer retained the name.
According to the case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is freely spoken, and there are no claims against the proceedings below, and no damage compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately placed on foot after hearing with the authorized representative of the betting house at approximately 15.50 p.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he was released and that his case would be placed into the files.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details about the aircraft accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariado de Comunicaciones y Transportes in Mexico) reported that the investigation results on the accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its entirely incomplete structure could have been injured directly against the ground without a pilot’s emergency land.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters of height, with the helicopter lost the rubbish, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts.”
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the field where the machine had fallen down.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places, the surgery concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a clutch of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is primary to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Mexico Aircraft and Aid Services Secretariat), assured that the helicopter flew from the Estate Mayor Presidential with travel speed and dropped the plane to a soft slope.
“This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact.”
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, counted six relevant points to be taken into account during the investigation:
Visible flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight, which means that the team had to have sufficient views during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better views towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact location:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Maybe there was neither a loss of control over the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to the present time suggests that the helicopter was hit from straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the dispersed aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was cracked on the ground with its incomplete structure.
No indications of fire or explosion:
The remnants of the aircraft offer not fire or explosion at the accident location.
The last results indicate several ground contacts.
In the local investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above the sea level. The ground is drained and has a wrapping of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search in an area that went beyond the locked area on the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which increased the assumption that the incomplete aircraft structure had been plagued against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Agency) announced that it leads a research project to discover the genetics of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" to find the genetic markers in connection with excess weight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unity de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, declared that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritional specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Stakeholders can come to the sports sites of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He emphasized that the investigation began at Cuauhtémoc’s sports square (west of the state of México) and has continued at Nezahualcóyolt’s sports square (east of the state of Mexico) since October 8th.
When the goal has been achieved from 500 to 600 investigators, the study will continue on the Independencia sports square (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Day of Diabetes, he explained that it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill with agreement and under the supervision of their parents’ nutrition-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
It further indicated that the individuals measured on Saturdays (weight, size, waist range), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (testing of genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López emphasized that this investigation would be carried out in the occasion of the health care personnel concerning the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obesity boys increased by 77 percent and the proportion of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was founded because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from the other peoples.
He said an average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5% of African birth, which is reflected in genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity presses itself in the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calories) we are taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the study participants would be in a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they had a degree of excess weight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and indoor arm (acanthosis), which indicates the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. Doctors explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest changes in lifestyle appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the lack of movement, that is, the lack of movement in the daily life, spending most of the time of the day in front of the TV and using means of transportation, instead of walking short ways.
The high intake of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sugarized beverages and carbohydrates (tomales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high intake of fat and proteins, as well as the genetics that is intended to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents blow holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, developed with polymers modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If it would be aware of the signs that come from the road cover, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 holes if the rain season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of Mexico Valley) is completely breaking out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ), warns and securews.
In his lecture "holes of the technical perspective", which he held as a chemistry on the occasion of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for designing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road coating and thus avoid the appearance of holes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
Adhesive behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180° C. as a liquid, at 120° C. it is very fluid and almost solid at 50° C. while it becomes brief at very low temperatures.
“This means that the asphalt’s resistance on the roads is not equal, but changes on a day depending on weather conditions and temperature changes,” the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road covering, composed of six material layers, including the last three asphalts.
Between the upper layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, baded in asphalt and then reinforced stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer has been baked in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road coating.
"If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemistry engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer will be designed, the so-called carrier layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also baked in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and it must make friction.
The street coating receives and distributes most forces, the carrier layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be considered, especially water, because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the ground is moist, water enters the layer and only exits difficult again, causing a dissipation of all layers of the road layer and as a result the appearance of holes.
When a blow hole arises, he said, "the cover layer will first be removed, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by adequate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of holes, which is why the thickness of each layer of the road coating must always be relative to the vehicle load, and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research works were still waiting for themselves, for example, about asphalt emulsions that are already on the market in other countries, and with which the crash holes were easily repaired without using high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impacted that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get Miss Colombia's crown.
El Valle receives his 14th missile.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in awarding the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner podium, a silver crown and the band she exhibits as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca (1989), Isabelle Conscele (1989), Isabelle Conscele (1989), Leiria Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez (1989)
The big question that many ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she was chosen as the Queen of the Police and the Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the Miss of Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury’s decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “What book has influenced you most and why?”, posted by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it’s a way to civilize, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped the strongest for my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’ is a pretty deeply going book.
It is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that heaves 'suffering'.
One answer that came to little counter-love, first because of the term ‘civilizing itself’ and second because she hadn’t explained concretely how every book called her had influenced her.
But after completion of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the loved one of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred, who had gotten all the inhabitants and who had gotten all the prizes in advance (gastronomic competition Easter, audience voting on the best hand-made costume and Reina Mother), "the other candidates could not be jealous of what the Queen had made on stress.
And this was noticed at their first presentation in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two lifts at the crown feast.
Although it occurred safely with both, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico presented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to the Miss shows that the candidate, who wins most awards during the competition, finally does not become Queen.
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty, declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on social feeling, that she had already worked together before participating in the competition in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the behind and fibrosis that she was noted in the stomach, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The queen’s coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body that there would be be better, but her problem with the fibrosis in the abdomen, which was hardly noticed for me honestly, expressed her score on the last day.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos believed that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and that place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel forecast emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to be realised at night. It was declared that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to not let her come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina starts her year of reign, not as a Queen, but as a Princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who has escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopist of the Cali Attorney's Investigation Unit (CTI) was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Forzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had a preparation service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completing the necessary courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great was waiting for him.
Friday night he fled from Palmira to Cauca by helicopter.
He knew he was supposed to identify two bodies, and the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be, so he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the same as the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, didn't wear glasses and was very thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a light lamp compared Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Then that night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to tell that he was actually the Chief of the FARC.
On trace search
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the assessment that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González gave was very important at a press conference on the use of "Cano".
Many people do not know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and stolen matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals file false identifying documents or they do not have.
We take the fingerprints from them and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house when he stole, because the thief had supported himself with his hand exactly at this point when he took a full-stopped jewelry and money safe.
“Walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the reduction of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts,” he recalled.
Using the fingerprints, suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead was found surrounded by snap bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected, and a fingerprint on the bottle actually matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is connected to the place where the offence was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents were taken from the object.”
When they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take it.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the person’s office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," the expert said.
He said it wasn’t everything as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint either.
However, it can be used when you perform a corresponding comparison.
The "Impaired" calls out the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed together in tents on the Zuccotti square.
A majority came to the space command and switched its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday urged the authorities of New York when they tried again to enter the Manhattan square with a judgement order after they had been wiped out of the square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti square, on which they had a judicial arrangement that allowed the "employed" tents to enter the new tents at this point, while another part of the movement stood at the space command and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests came.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmans of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray suggested that the response of the "emphasis" to the space of their tent camp, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent space of the square and approved the demonstrators of the tents.
In addition, the "empathies" occupied a new park located at the crossing of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police came and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give accurate numbers.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had arrived at this point, in which an arrangement of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for the intermediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place (a land in private property) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing which is still held for this Tuesday, and to analyze the legitimacy of the morning breakdown.
Some of the square-driven demonstrators carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with themselves and distributed them, even giving them some police officers who guarded the square, resulting in “some small clashes,” as Bray reported that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities to delete members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and the application of "status adopted after the occupation and prohibits the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made clear before the press that due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the place for public transport and the demonstrators had been relinquished, and the demonstrators noted that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the cleaning of the Zuccotti square carried out in the morning, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and that was decided because the demonstrators “deeped against the right.”
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to spare the square because it had turned "to a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to damage others," because "some businesses would have received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life."
“The breakdown in the morning was evil and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added to the movement, accusing the mayor of “do not respect the freedom of the press.”
The officials of Occupy Wall Street reported that they were thinking of organizing “large actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now will be the actress and model at a Christmas show of Canadian television the Virgin Maria.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will take place in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, and will inspire a very special Virgin Maria life.
CTV today broadcast pictures of the television show in which Anderson - also for the spread on the internet of a self-shown porn, in which she appears along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as a virgin Maria with a doll in the throat to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” as a child.
CTV’s Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, which is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American girl Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spirale of the free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the destructive earthquake, which embedded into a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced was World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo assessed property damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakened despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarter-long cases, the data on the gross domestic product was used to finally complete this chapter from July to September: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the high-percent rate for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the machine sale for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual shift of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awake especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, started by growing expenditures for vehicles, travel and recreational employment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - becomes one of the "refuge currency" of investors who flee before the debt crisis of the eurozone and the tremendous forecasts for the US, a privilege that lies like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the rating of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
“We must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand, and the rapid upgrade of the yen,” said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very enthusiastic.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had shown more clear signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the brake would be drawn with the largest economic potentials.
Because he dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 points in August.
The eurozone is even below this average value, which is 100 after it dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Returns Doubts
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-rise risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a true conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, said yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days appointed at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new savings measures and at least not take his demands to the 19 February.
“The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions made at the summit of 26 October,” Papadimos said yesterday on the opening of a parliamentary debate, which tomorrow will reach its highlight with the vote of trust for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s communication does not acknowledge doubts about his attitude: “We have committed to support the transitional government, but nothing else.”
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge from the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million Athens needed, and he cleared that he would not accept any commitment to the fulfillment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated about the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors “soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek guy still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: “These are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen emphasized Spain's "preponderable" position in terms of this kind of financing
Spain “has reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance.”
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has developed worldwide as the second donor for this means of international cooperation over the last two decades. Her "Wesen" is based on that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in humans".
The Queen consecrated yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro loans in Valladolid, and was convinced that there was “no doubt” that this kind of business would be “absolutely essential” to achieve the millennial targets set by the United Nations until 2015 and “in particularly the goal of living, the number of people with less than one dollars.”
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carrys out this task with responsibility," noted Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit to Thursday will "create new capacities and better loan opportunities for the poorest and particularly for women.
“We have achieved a lot of successes and faced a lot of challenges.”
The summit on micro loans is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to boost “two basic objectives”.
The Queen said it is intended to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The concept of micro loans goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described her as an “admiral idealist who has been dedicated to fighting poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on site.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006, "we can observe continuous development," the queen explained, whose commitment to this project was assessing her yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "the poor speaker".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by animating the attendees to participate in the debate and searching for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she emphasized that it is a mistake to bond development aid at times of economic booms, because it is a "lasting commitment".
Jiménez believed that the micro loans are a "most and rigorous policy to eliminate poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victimized.
For Spain, micro loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained “success”, “marginalized” people to give “hope” to “they are always in front of closed doors” and to the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the residents in a city opening “their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity.”
CDU suggests the election of the EU President due to general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November) took place for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulty.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but has continued in autumn, especially to allow activists to estimate the government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy's tomorrow as a lax.
The European Commission's proposal for presidency proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Below 1001 delegates had only nine voted against, ten had refrained from the vote.
The several-minute steady ovation, which was first applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later, lies no doubt on the part of the three European-adjoined finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - just like the applications - bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could be expressed by an enhancing European Union control modification of the Lisbon Treaty regarding the budget policy of countries in the eurozone; however, it could also be possible in the election of the President of the European Commission based on general vote to give Europe a face."
This, however, is definitely one of the proposals for application adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
It is certainly little likely that the 47 will quickly agree to this revolution: Great Britain is deniing the thing, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is placed.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Board of Directors, according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously brought about an enhancement of Germany’s position.
Consequently, the chancellor of calming the climate within her party has strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the trouble-in-European countries that would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European request for the significance of German-French friendship is dedicated to a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Actually one of the highly humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic Army.
What represents fraud in disease messages?
Following the family aid, UMP and government now attack the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family aid cash and present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state, which has always been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack that comes from the effort to undergo the economy in a hardness sample, but, on the other hand, not less preloading an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the Government aims to introduce a fourth Career Day before taking into account a sick report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker without the specific company’s permission would lose the wage of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A suggestion that, according to the newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to raise anger, however, would help income 280 million euros.
And the rather symbolic character was accompanied by another adoption: to grant the official an unpaid carence day in the case of illness (therefore, unlike the three carence days in the private sector, there is no carence period for them).
Meanwhile, these issues are in the discussion, the majority also redeems fraud topics, this time targeting the abuse associated with labour absence.
“Controls will be much more important, and furthermore, these repayments will be when required,” Xavier Betrand warned Sunday, November 13, before the RTL broadcaster’s microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the areas of disease reports seems a little unproportionate.
Indeed, it has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 and of political offensives that have been most commonly fruitful.
French people are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us however remain with the country-wide numbers first.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
As part of the Healthcare Economic Research and Documentation Institute, the daily agreements in 2008 accounted for EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
This amount fell by 46% in relation to maternity leave and work accidents and 54% in relation to disease leave, which is €6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5% health spending.
In 2010, a study of the Alma Consulting Group showed that the French were awarded only 14.5 disease days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
An average value that represents certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed indicated that they did not have taken a single hospital day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clears that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbors, the French workers tend to be incapacity to work elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (sickness or otherwise reasoned) occiled between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% in the Netherlands and 18% in the United Kingdom.
Fraud in disease reports represents a disappearing low share of black work.
With regard to fraud, there is only a weak outreach.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 leads to systematic controls in disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public University of Education of Technicians and Engineers) found below 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 realised short-term disease reports that were in 37,050 cases "unleased or too long."
In the systematically controlled cases of sickness of more than 45 days, there were less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which were 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who claimed a sick report.
A numeral that represents only a weak exam β compared to those of black work, for example.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, writer of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit decline per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore much more than the latter defrauding.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adaptation program to stop its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this before Parliament, adding that the ones granted by his government by the Union had not been enough to complete this task.
“In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” he said in his first public speech on the opening of the Parliament’s vote on trust.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit meeting on 27 October was the new government’s “major task” as the country’s participation within the eurozone was “in the game,” as he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has planned to lower the country's state deficit to "9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights Reject New Savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared for additional savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting of his Party's New Democracy.
He had agreed to be prepared with the requirements of reducing budgetary deficit and debt, as well as for the fight against waste, however, was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, an economic and currency commissioner who prevented the IMF and EU from release the necessary loan of over 8 billion euros without written guarantee of all parties about their support for the planned measures, had answered that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from Auben.
Euthanasia and accompanied death must be legalized, says an expert crew
Canadians live in refusal to death, as shown in a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relief agents, and this also beyond the cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada involved six experts linked to each other in various areas of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law in such a way in order to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this election stands, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a start, experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company EIU that had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the Earth’s ball.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th rank, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the topic of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain remedies, the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, however, ultimately, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of death attacks entered in the hospital in Quebec is the highest.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions, which are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already empowered, to make no amendments to the criminal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts, there is no evidence that such a decriminalization would be used in their application, i.e. practical implementation of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetents or incompetents.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday in a teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let’s realize that according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians were already in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that they allow people at the end of their lives to mitigate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valued.
With regard to those who have already practised an accompanied suicide, 41% respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or setting up the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, said the authors of the report.
Likewise, these in their Recommendation Directory suggest that it should be stated in the Criminal Act that the disruption of the funds for which a legal denial had provided should not be considered criminal.
The expert group also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a cessation of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relief agents, and this also beyond the cancer cases.
Lastly, the Board calls for consideration at least on the pain relief means already widely applied in the Canadian health care institutions, as they did not serve as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts on the legal area of healthcare have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of reporting experts, among other things, “extreme” as they set no limits to the euthanasia practice of patients in the final phase.
“This opens the gates to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to be helping him in his suicide,” says RA Deschamps, who saw a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social circumstances of society.
But now, he says, there would be guidelines and commitments in a society.
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled "pro-euthanasia manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports concerning the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign to power
Damascus calls for a "complott"
Syria is more isolated
Partisans Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the Außenministerial authorities.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which, however, opposes it thanks to Russia’s support and denies a “complot” against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union has exacerbated its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syrian countries, had received position in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the official Arab Prime Minister who asked President Bashar al-Assad to set up his officer in Syria, in which the forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
“If Bashar would have the interest of his country in the heart, he would decline, but besides, he would also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life,” said the King of Jordan, Syrian neighbor country, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crown of success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, must go," he said in an appeal to Syria, the neighbor country in which Turkey is taking a constantly harsh attitude.
The United States, on the other hand, welcomed the "exaltation of the consensus against Assad and the making of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“International community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharper tone in the face of the repressions in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a state department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power have been killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed at "Shot Changes and Heavy Bomb Attacks for Jobar" in Homs' Empire.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Trade Walid al-Mullim nevertheless believed that the country "controls the end of the crisis".
He, by the way, has reacted with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which represents his assessment of a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be given up, he added, “the complots forged against Syria would fail.”
According to the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League now investigates a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Auo Trade Minister Alain Juppé also pronounced in favour of sending UN observers to help civilians against repressions of the regime who captured him into his "Paranoia" protectively.
A new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis rise plan adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Außenminister Sergej Lavrov classified the Arab League’s decision as “incorrect” yesterday to keep itself from the endorsement of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.

Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be sacrificed
Mario Monti, a future Italian leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his stab and implement a program that requires “offers” to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before the today’s confrontation of trade unions and employment.
It was his task to call for a cabinet to Parliament, which consists relatively strictly of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the president of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had been waiting for Mario Monti to vote to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will summit in the presentation of a removal list presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to Chief of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock markets and obligation markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will be duly and understanding."
His order by the president was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the trouble had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The official prime minister should establish a mainly technocratic stab, although he emphasized, would like to include “politicians” as well.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament’s proof of trust until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working urgently in order to make Italy a “renewed protagonist” in Europe.
A spokesman of EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “this does not change our diagnosis towards the Italian economy even with regard to the new government.”
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget compensation target in 2013 despite the savings plans taken over the past few months, has in particular applied for new hardness measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Chief of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet on Monti on Tuesday, also consists of the need for economic stimulation, because a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit numbers.”
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as the EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" as well as another "Italy".
The great unknown in this case was the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preliminary elections, as Italy has up to 200 billion euros of state bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Wjacheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a US NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency AIEA and other documents from this UN agency to determine this scientist.
The IAEA reported last week its “worldly concern” on the occasion of a “possible military dimension” of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko apparently had been working in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and had been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to have left the center to establish a company in Kiev that creates "Nano Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA mentioned "strong evidence that the development of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only immigrating in this technology, but also, as a state member of the agency announced, his entire career has been essential in this nuclear energy program.
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violence crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly declined or have only increased lowly.
According to this, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 increased by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence crimes against Catholics, a 4% decline in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” has increased to 6,628 cases in very weak cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, the FBI said.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worriing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First emphasized the Human Rights Organization.The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law,” added Paul Legendre, a responsible for the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he said, considering that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the "hate crime".
The “hate crime” is an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights in U.S. federal law.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violence against race, skin colour, religion or birth and now also include sexual belonging crimes.
Twitter changes the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again resemble that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better reading live tracking the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and tracked by your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow to track your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, whether they favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "at a small percentage of users" in August, Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for little instinctive functioning, equipped with something esotherisch beautiful wording (RT zur Referenzierte Repetition of the Posts einer anderen Person). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiated, thus opens a broader audience with a maniement more comparable to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "Tweets".
“This is useless, intrusive and is too similar to Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The ‘Activity’ function will help me better track certain elements of my flow twitter,” said Dannykronstrom.

Register a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria on Tuesday decided to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid possible degradation by rating agencies on the side of the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was highly personally Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision from the outgoing Council, although the public Austrian debt is 74.6%, so far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s payability would not drop to AAA on AA+, we would have to pay more than three billion euros of interest every year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Aue Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: Heads of State and Government would have then required the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The adoption taken by the Austrian government is similar to the German model, since Germany was the first European country that had incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while from 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while regional states and communities should have budgets balanced.
The objective is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criteria set out by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japan’s official authority would intervene once again on the currency markets if the Yen would continue to rise.
"If we should stop excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did last time," Noda said in a statement.
On Tuesday, the yen was close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen for dollars to lower the Japanese currency value, which has been taking a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
Yen has risen, however, regularly, by purchasing investors who view the yen as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar dropped under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is rotten under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar scored around 120 yen, the euro over 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it exaggerates the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
“Japan is fighting after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region, for its reconstruction,” says Noda, who fears that this fatigue of the Yen could already kill the weak rise in the germ.
The third economic power in the third quarter has grown -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the rising export gains and the consumption of the households "pleaded" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the pain of the Yen does not "reflect the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, on his own, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its currency policy committee on Tuesday, to take all thoughtful measures to remove the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, the Deputy Governor of the Institute, noted that BoJ has already launched "suitable steps" and led to the statement that no additional currency locking is expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Note Bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cut the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) coverage amounts spent on various purchases of financial title to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet quickly to the height, exchanges make retreaters
The risk of infection of the debt crisis is constantly untermining the European identifiers.
Despite the official record of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened country continue to rise constantly.
The exchanges that are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone also drift this Tuesday, November 15, a little more in negative landscapes.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions regarding the return of state bonds in the euro zone in difficulties, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by the press agency Reuters.
The exchange in Tokyo, which, in turn, suffers from the fear of market participants once again regarding capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued, had closed with a decrease of 0.7%.
“Japan and the rest of the world have directed its eyes to Europe, and trade moves to limited variation corridors as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurvival of concern about the future of the eurozone will damage the unit currency that continues its bass on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m. the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dollers, so it dropped 0.4%.
According to the exchange makers, it has declined after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party gathering at Congress on Monday, had approved a request which provides for the possibility for countries in trouble to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italian and Spain’s loan rates are still at a very disturbing level.
On Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian obligations reached 10 years 6.85%, which of the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to nourish the fears of investors.
Future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti called for more time on the markets to restore the situation endangered by paralysis by debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the view of the markets, as the parliamentary elections in the country will take place on Sunday.
The interest share ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has again achieved a new, historic high.
In anticipation of growth in the eurozone
In the third quarter, France had a growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo a little better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE reviewed the decline in the numbers of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the GDP instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that concerns the most economic experts.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first bill of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m. with the EU Commission warning of the risk of re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Victory About Dogms
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term views or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and electricity costs directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting for the opportunity to think about this topic and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it investigates the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, the demographic evolution advances a doubled electricity demand until 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce constantly electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitutive source, nor the case in Switzerland, which is planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
In Fukushima, the United States decided to join another unit in its park by re-operating the Three Mile Island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model focused on renewable energy sources is occasionally designed as a model, however, reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will decline in the form of a reduction in the electricity price, an increased energetic dependence, especially from Russia, in the form of an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will be notable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives a chance to think about.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European wind energy leader, from which it relies 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 outbreaks and electricity price each are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the strength of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
Because the energy price in the globalized economy is a key role in competitiveness as well as a paddle of stability of the industry on the national ground, the French companies have an advantage due to the most economical electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong rise in energy price, which will lead to illusion the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of French people are equally unwilling to pay, as it makes it acknowledge resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let’s realize that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a lot of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France makes the decision to exit nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victimized, and the annual 6 billion euros in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly declined.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer is preprogrammed?
In order to resolve the energetic equation, you must admit that there is nothing like a devil work a miracle to generate electricity.
Areva developed CO2-low solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
These working teams that have made a name because of their professionalism are just too obsessed with the safety idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, thus it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was raised by reactor construction and infinite human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to be forgotten that the accident was caused by two natural disasters never before, causing the death of several thousand people.
The core industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since electrical technicians are considered to be desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by leaving them free train to ripe the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be unresponsible to leave emotions, dogmas and party managers dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload by police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility with this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France had referred to itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students from the official side had marked the week views, the Minister of Interior had in conjunction (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "no talents, wallmakers, or cellars from abroad needed".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
Indeed, there is an extensive consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand, the sound of Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976, “900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, are likely to constitute no problem for a country,” on the left, by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, “France cannot accept the whole poverty of the world.”
The only difference is in the degree of gross movement
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish climbers was divided both right and left in 2005.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of gross movement, which is willing to be acknowledged to the immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities that point to partnership development allows to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically expensive.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron presented us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest insights on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive influence of immigration.
Immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that these threaten to replace local workers, especially the lowly qualified, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in reality much more complementary than local salary workers, since they are practicing careers in sectors that are technically unloaded.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that little irritate local salary workers who are more qualified among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties in working in a country where there is a lack of anesthetics, this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigrant access to wages and domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that 1% increase in immigrant flood results in a co-inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation brought by immigrants and economic growth is advantageous (high share of citizen immigrants among American Nobel prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries, at an average of approximately 1% of the overall budget.
The World Employment Organization estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 will average a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wishes to enter his mandate to bring about the missing intersections "with his teeth".
These teeth, however, that immigrants should disturb, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should remember himself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had allowed the entire 20th century to pass over the tragedies of the First World War, Totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed it was rich to exercise the right to vote, as directly as possible to see democracy once and for all over their enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of mindset.
The general voting right, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as well the "suppressive instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot then expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe in which we are present is a economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek true-false referendum would have had twice a significant character in this regard: once that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered to be overcome.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer targeting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to urge a success of the national referendum, which was organized depending on the needs and in wrong order.
A free ticket for the sole European ruler or a jump with eyes connected into the empty of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, explained and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one no longer knows where to end the numbering - since there is only one crisis, and it reigns in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its inadequacy and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated internationally.
It is worried about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe – it is the whole Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations joined in it.
The urgency is to give the people’s sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is in the entirety whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, get free from markets, and start a future through investments.
The exit of the crisis has decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legality, without leading us to destruction.
After Jacques Delors and the Socialists have been fighting this proposal for a long time, today everyone urges European economic leadership.
Agreed.
But imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it plans to the citizens - would be a renewed folly and another suckle.
We have to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general good
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens its gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 would actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most carrying segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply keeping the card at a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold one year, this year 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe gains soil in terms of uncontact payment after it has long been afterwards the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
This year, Carrefour has issued 2.5 million non-contact pass MasterCards.
To move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large French financial institutions have committed to systematically delivering bank cards to their customers in the future equipped with contactless chip,” announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the future’s payment means: the mobile phone.
A disappearing small percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
“They have fallen in delay.”
“But they should at least experience a real upward development next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks take initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer that enables its customers to pay contactlessly by phone.
Terrorist front is understood, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationships between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relationships between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian vice minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now achieved “certainty.”
"The way both organizations are working with and the relationships of intelligence services suggest clear cooperation," he explained.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the abduction of two French people in Nigeria took place in January last year has promoted interfaces to days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi were to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of a operation carried out by the French specialist units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the ruins at the site of operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the wilderness of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered nearby as the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but you must undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
“It is, however, thoughtable.”
"It is known for years that the sect relates to financial and intellectual support from Auben and that it is increasingly active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, these “support services” have become increasingly evident in their course, as well as Boko Harem’s speeches and operational modes, which now indicate the removal of suicidal assassins and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to start in Washington has been pushing on Abuja since that time to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the grouping for a long time as a community of Illuminates, which does not need to be paid special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the surrounding of a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which in Haoussa means as much as "western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger experiences rapid success.
She politizes herself and demands strict compliance with the sharia, while her joined activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
However, the reaction on the side of Abuja is indifferent as usual.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
The prison-taken Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect became more radical and leaves its high towns in the north.
Last Christmas, she known to be an assassination in Jos that demanded 80 people’s lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the fault of a suicide attack that occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters becomes the primary international target target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worried by all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem in Nigeria on a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan and was willing to tell everything.
The World of Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and unknownness about China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakening America lead a complex world with simple not to say: uniform ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and his co-strieders have repeatedly stated their thunder statements as well as their statements regarding the aue-policy, a traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel’s aid - often understood in no way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the Great Old Party, Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese in front of the WTO and dealt with the leading topic of the "currency manipulation" in an America that by the immigration of the entire industry sectors to Asia, it is most irritated.
He said that it was stupid to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of aue-policy, has almost swifted the air with respect to his emotions.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive conversation exchange with Beijing (also Obama’s current attitude).
But Huntsman is not heard because he stagnates in the depths of opinion surveys.
Reagan's Ebenbild
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I command Iran to stop," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb.”
He also promised strengthening military aid to Israel and accused Obama of remaining guilty to this partner’s commitments.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, a second highest-placed candidate, has a shameful document uncertainty.
Recently, he called on to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to keep the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is ready to serve the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s prohibited reaction of torture measures against alleged terrorists in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a high-political weight.
Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a amateur and had to give water to his wine, regarding the topic of anti-terror.
They persist rightly on the failure of his naive conversation with Iran, the rapid withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his incompetence in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so unforced.
The population rather estimates the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, they have kept themselves from military interventions leading to removal.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America needs to be rebuilded economically to bring his leadership position back to life.
North Stream, New Gate to Russian Gas in Europe
The gas transmission line Nord Stream, which runs on the base of the Baltic Sea and connects the Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to make this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, have last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea Coast under orchestral sound and with the opening of the new gas broadcast Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas transmission line is intended to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas annually through a first 1,224 km-length pipeline that connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg Prepommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of the total French consumption – will be completed at the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line is already left on its own path.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this huge building is a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will, in fact, enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any track track by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most committed to the debate, was not refrained to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically first sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even higher supply security by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of the discharge of European energy, as the project has broken a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has finished in almost five years to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and their gas stocks go to the snow.
“This gas transmission is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that combines us organically,” François Fillon confirmed in the opening of the gas transmission by pointing out in which degree the large gas contracts are also important by political and economic sides.
All of this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin in terms of gas delivery.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating, which is intended to protect it from ship bodies.
It rests on the sea ground, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, it had to be removed from the Second World War dating mine fields.
“About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for caution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Moreover, increased measures to protect the fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long serpent made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted throughout the entire length by nothing: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided outside the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have taken away from it because the Sweden had little struggled to see a Russian state society permanently settled at the height of their coasts.
"In the case of a variety, we close the gas transmission in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
Thus, in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas remote line is dismissed into the air.
However, this case is considered little likely by the constructors, as the seams were estimated to be consistent by a leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission line is guaranteed by both a underwater robot which is controlled for external observation purposes from a sea ship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission line.
It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas transmission line was designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo even the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are joined here (each to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas unies and the French company group GDF Suez (each to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission.
She has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transportation, in terms of extendable twenty-year agreement.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how large the amount of really transported gas fails," Jens Müller said.
The financing of the gas transmission construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are committed to recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas transmission line comes from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas outlet forces.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before it is transferred to the German gas transmission lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours supplied with candlelight with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular belt, its rubber belt, the egg shale colour sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then professional advisor of the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-produced production technology called Mole Skin (maulworm skin), which refers to a cotton lacquer used for example for patterns of pattern benches.
This type of notebook was very much asked among writers and travellers.
“Moleskine has resurvived an old and almost forgotten item that was considered to be an icon of an avant-garde artist until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible for Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and are established with a sale of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantastic image of buyers, as the notebook enthusiasts both businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, is now employing more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands to implement its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new writing needs, which consists despite the regeneration of the emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umway)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a band with leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood diversifying his products: pockets, date calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus set up a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers stay at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a target-conscious public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average value: 19% compared to 9% of the total unemployment population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which establishes the “Week of the Work for Disabilities”.
“The progress made within fifteen years is significant.”
“The unemployment rate was not double, but three times higher.”
“Nonetheless, nothing to do is still enormously much to do.”
However, it has to be said that for disabled unemployed people, many obstacles continue to exist before they get a job.
Most often it hits the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have an abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the work and that form the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a company's association founded in 1992, which is helping to apply to disabled workers.
So much about the actual brakes.
It remains the unpronounced, the mindset, which certainly, but still slowly evolve.
A study conducted by the IMS Entrepreneurship in April for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," which "overrepresented" is "by people in wheelchairs, psychologically or intellectually minorised".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a wide range of ways to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled employees, which was established in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
“We are now at 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization commissioned to invoice contributions from companies that violate this law.
The evidence is that the number of "paying" facilities' fees has decreased, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies,” said Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large groups of companies.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of employees between 20 and 49 employees are employed with disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees are employed with 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Before they offered their foreheads on Tuesday night (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure that brought them the friendship.
It would have been too far reached to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bands.
Sitting side by side on the Stade de France spectator podium would have George Leekens and Eden Hazard well and would like to close peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had harvested nothing but praise for his person.
“I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian.”
"I want to look forward," Liller said.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national elf, “It’s a unit that justifies everything.”
“I am in Lille all year round, which isn’t the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to go to the start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, launched Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France to finally shine.
However, without refraining from the note of "pleasure".
He fired the French national team since he was seven years old, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to strengthen even more the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he explains.
“We have just walked the way.”
"To be able to play it means great luck!"
Leekens left himself acknowledge with goodness.
“The proud to express a gala match.”
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its property as "neighbors" - that France has again become a team at a very high level," and that little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician seems very likely to share the plane with the blues (the French National Elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he said.
“We are planning one thing, players are ambitious, they are hungry.”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, will take the return against Bosnia (22:00 a.m.) in Lisbon this Tuesday.
During the game, both teams had missed the ability.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt for him that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to remove an opponent, Bosnia.
Given the game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the match for more than an hour, but the team was unable to oppress the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
“This is a good outcome, however, which poses a certain risk because we have not achieved away gate.”
However, at home, in their bright stage de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going through in front of a audience that might be equally happy to play, even if the match was naturally announced as “very little,” the optimistic but clear Bento said.
“We expect a very little match, but are fully convinced that we can win the top,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz said.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a gate.
A decision may already suffice to the Bosnians who also need a gate.
“This is a good outcome, however, which poses a certain risk because we have not achieved away door,” Bento said.
“We’re going to attack a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica already, the Portuguese would have planned to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time it is implemented into action.
