Welsh's experts are worried when they're going to be like a muppets' dolls.
There's a concern between some AM against a sugesti that their terms should be transformed into MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Welsh Parlemen Welsh).
It's up to the plan to change the name of Majelis into Welsh Parlement.
The AMs all over the political spectrum worry if it can invite the cemohan.
A AM party labor says that his group is concerned, "It's thick with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One member of the universe says that his group is a union, felt that it was not easy, and has proposed some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative says that his group thinks open" to the change of name, but judging that this is an apprait of MWP shorts to Muppet.
In this context of w in Welsh is spoken like a letter in English Yorkshire.
The commission of Majelis who at this time set up the law to introduce the change of the name, said, “The last explanation of any mention for the AM is certainly a problem for the members of the people.”
The Wales 2017 government's decision gave the Majelis Wales to change his name.
In June, commission published public conferences for a known proposal to find a vast support to call the examiner as Welsh Parliament.
As to the problems of the AM, the commissioner is more fond of WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Welsh), but the MWP options have a lot of support on the public consulation.
The AMs seem to present the alternative options, but the struggle to reach the consensus can turn the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to give up the law plans in a few weeks.
The law of reforming will include changes-- other changes about the work of the specimen, including the rules specified for the AMs and the comite system plans.
The AMs will get the final voice of the question about how they should be called when they discuss law.
The Macedonian community went to give the voice to referendum about the change of the country's name
The sound owners will determine whether their country name will be changed into North Macedonian.
It was held in an effort to settle differences for a decade with the Greek neighbors, who also had a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbor next to the north showed a confession against his property and has repeatedly refused the U.S. membership and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice fighter to change the name, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the support of referendum, including the prime minister of Zorev, consider that the change of the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bellnessless when Church-gereja in Harlem was having trouble.
"When the historis, the parents I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, no one."
He said that all those bars could be checked.
"The people are socializing in other ways" right now, he says.
"Bar is no longer a living living room around where people visit him regularly."
So is the same with the church, he was worried that the produce of aset won't last long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they will come back again from the beginning."
The churchs, he added, could be replaced by the apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help to keep the rest of the holy places around him.
"The possibility of the person who will buy the condominium in these buildings is white people," she said, "and therefore it will speed the days where these churchs are closed together because it's not possible those who move to the condominium will be members of these churches."
The two churchs were built by white congregation before Harlem became the city of black people of Meunitas in the late 1800, St. Martin one decade later.
The original white Metodis jet moved in the 1930s.
The black driver who had been worshipping in the area has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under John Howard's Head, who led a ecereran trade boikot on 125th road, the main path to shopping in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavy, but when the people of the priest Johnson were planning to rebuild, they built the tower bell.
Priest David Johnson, the priest Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly called the tower bell as "The poor people"
A master that rings a tower in July gave him another word: "A culture treasure" and "a history instrument that was not replaced."
A scholar, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also recorded that this was the first tower bell in the world that was played by the black musicians, Dionisio A. Lind who turned around the bigger tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin the last few months is a complicated architecture and contractors, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopeal constellations.
The vestry - the body of the clausement manager, which is formed from the public leaders - wrote a letter to the amusement of July with anxiety that the "will try to weigh the cost" on the vestry party, although the vestry isn't involved in arsitect and contractor who was sent by auspan.
Some of the paroles complain a little bit of transparant from the military.
Hiu was hurting the 13th-year-old teenager in the lobsterlaming in California
A hiu attacked and hurted a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was dived to catch lobsters in California in the lobster opening event, a shipping an officer.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. at Beacon Beach in Encinity.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been dived with his friends for half an hour in Saturday morning when he heard a boy asked for help and then in a group to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only an exaggeration after catching lobsters, but then he said "the boy" that the boy yelled, ‘ I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
The whole bone was torn," Hammel said he realized it when he had taken the child.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There was a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flying to Rady's Rady Hospital in San Diego where he was handled in critical conditions.
The species of the sharks are responsible in the attack are unknown.
The Captain of Larry Giles said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was described as a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim has a severe wound on the top of his body.
Officers closed access to the coast of Pontus in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for the importance of investigation and for security.
Giles realized that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan is blocking the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the most beautiful kios-kios of the toserba who were managed by assistantsten specialists.
As part of a substansial urge to the British beauty market, 8 billion, which continues to grow while the sale of fashions and the household equipment is down, the more beautiful kios-kios will be tested on 11 stores all over the country and will be developed to more years in the next year if that's going to work.
Investasi in the field of beauty became a hunt for the supermarkets to use the racks that were used to be a TV line, microwave, and the household equipment.
Sainsbury says that it's going to double the most beauty bidding to reach  3,000 products, including rally like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The network that's currently started from L'Oreal, maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more spaces with a crowded area as found in the shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also launchs his bootic makeup networks until most of its products would be friendly for vegan - something that is getting more attached by young defenders.
In addition, Fragrance Friffers Shop will test the consesi in two Sainsbury stores, the first one opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second was opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The online Belanja and switching food buyers in small numbers in local shops means that the supermarket has to do something more to motivate people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief of the Sainsbury, has said that gerais would be more like Mall when the supermarket chain tried to turn back like Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and without food.
Sainsbury has put Argos's arches on hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitat gerais since they bought both the waralaba two years ago, which he said has supported the sales of food daily food and made a more useful qualification.
Previously on the market to renovate the beauty department and farmation end with failures.
Sainsbury tested the effort of the statue with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after a discussion about how to divide the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy came up after Sainsbury sold 281 farming business to Celesio, the owner of the Farma Waralaba Lloyds, a value of the 125 million, three years ago.
It was told that Lloyds would play the role in the plan, with adding to some fancy skin treatment including La Roche-Posay and Vichy on four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director Sainsbury, said: "We've changed the display and the nuansa on the beauty kios to fix the mood for our visitors.
We also invested with trained associates who would be ready to offer advice.
Our networks are designed to fit all the needs, the environments that are attractive and a comfortable location indicate that we are now the destination of negotiating such a long way of shopping."
Peter Jones ‘geram' after Holly Willoughby pulls himself from the deal of a million.
The Dragons Den Star, Peter Jones went off ‘ irritated' after the Holly Willoughby show host of a life-style business deal for more focusing on the new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the merchandise of the household and accessory, actually.
This couple's business is similar to Goop's Gwynth Paltrow.
This morning, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he came out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' star Den, Petes Jones mad at the last moment, from the life-style business of their most profitable life - to focus on his contracts greater with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source states that Jones was so "third" when the young TV girl admitted during the Tuesday meeting at her government office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal - worth of a 1.5 million-- means she had no time to spend on the household equipment and accessory.
Their business has been compared to Gwynth Paltrow's Gwynth and is expected to multiply Willoughby's wealth of 111 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britania to one of his vacations,
A source says: "Of this far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which would make it last for a few decades to come.
His decision to step back makes everyone involved really cripple.
No one can trust what happened on that Tuesday, really close to the launch time.
There's a store full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell"
The experts believe in going forward to the Kingdom Hall of The Morning, which is one of the most expensive English stars, can lose the company to millions of dollars because of a large investment in products, starting from pillows and candles to wear and clothes, and there are potential for further launchs.
And this could mean the end of a long time friendship relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin are very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby built the truth with Capp in 2016, and Jones, who was 52 years old, joined as leader in March.
This couple vacation together and Jones had 40 percent shares on Baldwin's production company.
Willoughby's gonna be the duta for M destroyS and will replace Ant McPartlin as an nick of ITV called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night, "We're not going to comment about this business relationship."
Talk seriously ‘and then we fall in love'
He's kidding about the critics he's gonna get from the news for making a comment that some people are considered "no presidential" and has been very positive to the head of North Korea.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said with his "reader news."
"I didn't give up anything."
He found out that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was commended by Trump as a step forward for the North Korea’s distribution.
But denuklirization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world leaders in the United States on Saturday that North Korea did not see a proper "responsion" from the United States against the early part of North Korean armed movement.
On the contrary, he records, the United States continues to continue the sanction that he was trying to keep the pressure.
Trump's more optimistic in his speech network.
"We did our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this extraordinary relationship,"
He said that his success to fix the relationship with Kim has brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free hostages and reproduce American soldiers that are left to their homes.
And he's defending his unusual approach to talk about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this crowded arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, and pointing toward the right crowd in front of it.

President Joko Widodo has made a broken infrastructure infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the road construction and the train rel.
But the fund's lack has interfered with Mr. Joko's government while he's under the next year's re-conditional selection.
Joko's father also faced pressure from the constant tension that still lasted in Indonesia, where the majority of mayors have embraced more conservative faith.

The Parlement Parlemen Cromwell was the last memorial of the ‘ reconstruction of history'
It will become a bizarre justice for the destruction of ala-Talibans against many cultural artifacts and English religiouss that have been performed by a fanaticist Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community describes Mr. Crick's advice as a fool and " Trying to rewrite history."
John Goldmith, chief Cromwell, says: "It can't be avoided in debates now about the destruction of the statues, that configure Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster palace will be targeted.
Iconoklasme war of the British brothers is not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Maybe wrong Cromwell's descendants would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the past century.
The amazing presentation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorne Thorneycroft is a evidence of the 19th century and part of historiography a set of precincts that are still suspected by many people still worth being paid.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parlement defense against the outside pressure, in his case, of course the government.
Is that completely accurate, still a subyek of history debates that continue.
The fact is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is the sosok that could be known by individuals who described one side of the difference.
His work is as the Lord of Protector, as well as a reminder."
The killers struck the Chinese Map to Die
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to a local media report.
The man, who was identified by the name of the marga, was found dead with the artery cut off, covered with blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshui region of Guizhou, South Chinese Morning Post reports on Sunday.
A pig farm was prepared to inject the vaccine to a pig's pig on a pig farm in May 30 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to go with his cousins from the Yunnan provinces on the day of Thursday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of a pig's cage near him is open.
He said that in the pig's cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the male pig with the weight of 550 pon has wronged the farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousins are bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin known to the seaga "Wu", as was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows the Yuan entered the market at 4,40 on Thursday's day to feed the pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was not the Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Temple News that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police were collecting evidence in the location of the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reported on compatibilation for his death.
Even though rare, a pig attack case against humans has also happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachussett.
Ten years earlier, a pig with a weight of 650 pons stuck a Welsh farmer into his trucktor until the wife scares and throws out the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that a pig was usually unregistered but blood smells could act as "picu".
"They're just playing around.
They're bitter, very curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storms bring rain to the west of the United States.
Like, Badai Rosa was weak when moving on a colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Anyway, Rosa will cause floodwaters across the northern Mexico area and southwest of the United States a few days to come.
Rosa has wind with 85 mph speed, Categories 1, starting at 5:00 a.m., and it was 385 miles [5 km] west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may be moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Palung began to be formed over the Pacific Samudera, moving east to the U.S. Coast, when Rosa approached the California Baja on Monday as tropical storm and began to push off the northward to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical ammunition that is interacted with a close link will create an extended heavy rain in the West of Power for several days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous bandang flood, puing-puing flow and possibly a longsor land in the desert.
The lower tropical frequency will cause rainfall levels to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rained down in some of the West of Power, especially in most part of Arizona.
The Flood is likely to happen with the condition that is worse because of the kind of tropical rain that is spread.
It is not recommended to explore the desert by walking on foot because of a tropical rain threat.
Heavy rains can lead to violent waters and violent storms will bring local winds and dust.
A close-to-doll will cause local rain to part of the South California coast line.
Total rain curahs over half inches are enough, which can cause small puings flow and highways to be smooth.
It's gonna be the first rain in the area in their rain season.
Some tropical rains are going to start near Arizona weekends and Monday morning, before rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain rain will spread four corners on Tuesday and hold on to Wednesday.
In October will happen some of the great temperature changes all over the United States when Arktics get colder, but tropical areas are still hot enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There's an example of the dramatic temperature difference along the middle state on Sunday.
There's a difference of temperature almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For a few days ahead, the summer heat that is left will be formed and back spread.
Most parts of the United States and east are expected to start warm in October by speed spread as large as 80s from South Datarants to the North East parts.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate prediction shows a high chance for temperatures above average for the easts to mid-center October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday day by the court candidate of Crett Kavanaugh and the woman who claimed her to commit sexual violence that happened in 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television networks.
In the meantime, the political station continued, with the audience who took the reguler show in the last minute of Friday: a deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to do research for one week of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent certain if Kavanaugh had his body in a drunk state and tried to take off his clothes at the school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fire-fire testimony, said that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There's probably more than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have watched it.
The company counts average of the mall at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for another network that broadcasts this is not available fast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem in the number of people who watch it at the presentation.
In order to put this in perspective, it's the number of drivers that's almost the same number as the gameoff football or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who's opinion of the showers is very supporting the direction of Kavanaugh, superior from all networks with the average 5,69 million refugees during the entire congregation, says Nielsen.
ABC has a second position with 3.26 million farmers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with the number of 2,89 million farmers and CN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The precinct remains tall after the trial.
Flake is the key sock in the Friday drama.
After the modern - day Republican Republicans office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday in the morning's beating by the shower when he tried to lift up to the state of Justice.
He stood down a few minutes when he was interviewed by the maci, broadcasted directly in CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he said the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the strength when there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office had removed a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee.
The cable TV and the network of all broadcasts directly in a few hours later, when the Chakiman Comite will choose to advance Kavanaugh's courting to the entire Senat for the vote.
But Flake said he'd just do that with the understanding that the FBI will check the charges against the candidate for a week of distress, as was asked by the minority Democratics.
Flake has been convinced of some conversation with his friend, Senator Demokrat Chris Coons.
The talk with Coons and some Senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has the strength, since it's clear that the Republic's party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without research.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.

According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the votes in TPS throughout the region of the fierce conflict.
The groups of pro-depension have been camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Demonstration continues but forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, a electrician who went to a separateist protest with his wife said he was no longer hoping about Catalonia's prospects.
"Tahun and we were on one of our best momentes.
I saw my parents crying in anger because we could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although it was successful to win a vital victory even in the last December regional election, the party of Catalan's freedom has fought to defend the momentum this year despite many good leaders, who are in the courtship or in the prisoner waiting for their role in setting a referenceum and further declaration of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"This is getting to say," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine chiefs of Catalan's prisons since the end of the year, announced that he's going to call himself in a European Parlement selection next year.
"Keep as candidates for Europe's selection is the best way to identify the resignation in democracy values and oppression that we've seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The Gol printed by the press has given the victory of Livingston for the Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first Gol Dolly won for Livingston confirming victory
Livingston's Victory led to the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his department as the manager of Hebox club, above both of them in 18 games.
Dolly's attack has been evidence of the difference when Gary Holt side movements with the Hibernian on the second order.
Gerrard's side remains without victory in Premiership this season and face the head of Hearts who's eight points in front of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers met Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extending their unpredictable records invisited into six games, while Holt's head is still running down since he replaced Kenny Miler months ago.
Livingston lost a chance against the sloppy guest team.
The Holt team should have been so far off before they printed the gol, with their accuracy that gave Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break but his work across the gawang face, and then Alan Lithgow can only intersect his efforts after moving in and confronted with the sundulan of Craig Halkett from across the gawang.
The host is content to allow Rangers to play a superior game at the beginning, knowing that they can keep a team on the top of the dead ball.
And that's the way to produce a very important goal.
Rangers of free and Livingston had a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help out, who got a turn and printed gol from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers have been investigating the master but realized that the landlord's defense cannot be covered and the Liam Kelly kiper was completely unused,
The Pola continues to the second chapter, even though Alfredo Morelos managed to lure a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was chopped by the leg of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow is away from the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continues to come to Livingston's gawang and continues to sink, while two penalty klaims -- after the challenge of Halkett on the successors of Glenn Middleton, and one for the handballs - rejected.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A function and a fenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, they keep going on this road.
Their play style and personnel almost didn't change since they returned to the top board, but the big credit had to be given to Holt on the way he reinforced the team since he came.
He has so many jagoans.
Captain Halkett is so big, leading a goodly organized defense, while making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stay alert during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers are lack of inspiration.
Whatever they are at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break the home-side formation-- and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the center of the field.

Rosa’s Badai called Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Bandang Flood (Daerah’s Territory) may be lucky.
The tropical depresian that hit Arizona rare, but that's what it's probably going to happen in the early week because of the Badai Rosa energy traces left across the westwest desert, causing a risk of floodwater.
National Weather services have been issued a warning on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix cities, Flagstff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.

The other area of the southwest desert includes the center of Rockies and Great Basin is likely to be hit by 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of the amount of the amount that is reaching 4 inches.
For those in the free range of floodwaters, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because the region has been exposed.
Although the flood was a serious problem, some of these rainfalls may have been likely to benefit because this is now the western area of the resource.
According to the U.S. Department of Americans, only about 40 percent of Arizona areas have a little of extremic noise, second highest category," the weather.com report.
First of all, the track that the Badai Rosa leads to land across the California Baja was visited by Mexico

The rainfall may be high in some of the Mexico region, causing a high-water risk.
"Total rainfall three to 6 inches was expected to hit the California Baja to the West of Sonora, perhaps up to 10 inches," weather.com report.
Then Rosa will cross the north along with Mexico as a tropical storm before going to the Arizona border on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and to the south of the afternoon Tuesday.

Hundreds of people were killed by Indonesia’s earthquake, tsunamis, with the number of victims increased.
A little 384 people died, a lot of giant waves hit the beach, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the coast of Palu on Friday day when the waves were up to six feet (18 m) crushing the beach at dubbing, causing many deaths and crushing anything that was past.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake with the power of 7,5.
"When the threat of tsunamis increased yesterday, people were still doing their work on the beach and didn't run immediately until they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a talker for the Disease Body (BNPB) said at the influence of Jakarta.
"It didn't come alone, he dragged a car, wood, house, put everything on land,," said Nugrohoho, adding that tsunamis had passed over by 800 kph (497 mph) speed before stretching the coastline.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from tsunamis and survived, he said.
About 16.700 people are transferd to 24 service centers in Palu.
The air photographs produced by BNPB indicate a lot of buildings and stores that are destroyed, the bridges and the adjacents and a mosques surrounded by water.
With a row of milking all over the beach on Saturday.
The earthquake strings are located in a population of 2,4 million lives.
The United States of Technology and Technology (BPPT) states in a statement that energy was released on the Friday earthquake about 200 times as powerful as atom bomb force dropped in Hiroshima in the second World War.
The geographic city, which is at the end of a long narrow teluk, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said so.
Nugroho described the damage that happened as "extensive" and declared that thousands of houses, hospitals, expenses and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under a ruined building, he said, added that there are 540 victims injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho says that the victim and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 miles (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake center.
The communication "is completely paralyzed by no information from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There's more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Palang in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are headed into areas that have been affected by disaster.
"This is a tragedy, but this could be worse," he said.
The instrument related on Saturday has received many critical reasons for not to indicate that there is a tsunami that's going on Palu, although the authorities say that the waves have been perpendicular at the time the warning was released.
A amateur record shared in social media shows a man on the floor of a building sounds like a panicking warning would have been approaching tsunamis, toward those on the street below.
In a minute of water rolling around the beach, turning the building and the car.
Reuters can't prove the tape immediately.
Gempa and tsunamis are the greatest cause of electricity exaggerating communication around Palu so that the authorities try to coordinate the efforts of salvation.
The militarys have already started sending a cargo plane with help from Jakarta and other cities, saying the authorities, but the refugees are still in need of food and other trees.
The air Airport is opened back just to channel help efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko850 has been scheduled to visit the evacuary center on the Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami victim rose over 800.
That's so funny.
When the World Vision officers of Donggala had made it safely in Palu City, where those officers were refuge at the monetary tent built on their office yards, they had traveled through various areas of porks, said the Father Doseba.
"They told me that they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's terrible.
Even when the help group began slow to start a disaster break, some of those groups complained that there was a need for foreign volunteers who had the skills, who was going to go to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rule, funding, material and energy from abroad can only begin to take effect if a region that is officially officially known as national disasters.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a talker for the Red Palang Indonesia.
"When the government says, OKE, this is a national disaster," we can receive the International help, but there's no status.
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunamis in Palu, friends and families of the lost victims still hope that those they love will be part of the miracle that will fix the solar story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was released from the inside.
On Sunday, the rescuer brought out a woman trapped under puping for two days with the mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national team coach, has become a coach for two missing parallite athletes, who have managed to follow the Asian Games who ended this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still stuck in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are disciples.
"As a senior in the paralave field, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after the news about the Roa-Roa Hotel that broke around the paralatic community, with despair he sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who joined in the festival on the beach.
However, all the messages, just got a sign of ashes, not a centang two blue blue.
"I think that means a non-resentable message," he said.

A.S. should have doubled A.I.
Because China is more active in artificial intelligence, the A.S. should have doubled a number of funds that would be used for research in the field, says investor and practically A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who's been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after a variety of parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when A.S. was full of general strategies in general AI.
In the meantime, China identified his plan last year: aimed to be number 1 in an AI in 2030.
"Brown the AI research fund is a good start, remember all other countries tend to stay away from the A.S., and we're looking for the next breakout in the field of AI," said Lee.
Double the funds can double the chance until the next great achievement of the A.S., Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the Superpowers: Chinese, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has been invested on one of the top company in China, Face++.
In 1980s in Carnegie Mellon University he planned the AI system that beat the best Othello American player, and then he reported as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google branch.
Lee recognized the U.S. government technology competition before it was like Robotic Challenges for the last Disaster Research Project and asked when the next activity would be applied, to help identify the next visioner.
The researcher in the U.S. has often to work hard to win a gift from the government, said Lee.
"It's not Chinese who took the academy; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired characters from the university for the last few years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support efforts around the AI.
"I think green cards can be automatically offered for the PHD titleholder in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese Court released the Next Generating Development Plan in July 2017.
The Ilmu National National School provides funds for people in academic institutions same as the way Ilmu Alam and the organizations that share the money to the U.S. Researchers, but the quality of academy tasks in China, said Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defensement developed the World Health Center along, which was intended to involve industrial mitra and academicms, and the White House announced the Compensation for the World Warm.
And in this month DARPA (Mutend Defense Research Ageneration) announces a 2 billion Dolar investation in a initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested over 100 million Dolars a year for AI research.
In the meantime, the A.S. legislacy who asked for the National Security Commission for the World Healths to not see any further reactions for months.
The Macedonian people took a voice in order to change the name of the country
The Macedonians took a voice tax on Sunday to decide the change of the country's "Republik of North Macedonia," a action that will complete the dispute for a decade with Greek that had hacked his boarding offer to be a part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who has a province of Macedonia, defended the opinion that the name of the neighboring north representing the confession of his region and has forbidden it to join the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reach a deal in June according to the new name, but national psychiatrist that change would ruin most of the population of the Macedonian Slavia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his voice to that general selection and a boikot campaign has planted a doubt whether the selection could reach the minimum of 50 percent sound that would be necessary to make the result of the selection valid.
The question found on the voice is said: "Do you approve of the NATO and EU memberships by accepting an agreement with Greek."
The remarker of the name, including the prime minister Zorev, was entitled that it was a price to pay in order to get permission into the body like Europe and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that was born from Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the generation of Macedonia so they could live free under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years, in Skopjee.
Although not binding by law, enough members of parliament who say they will obey the results of sound taxings to make decisions.
A change of name requires a big number of two over three in parlement.
The nation's selection commission says there's no offense report until 1:00 p.m.
However, it turns out that voice taxing results only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parlement selection in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered selector gave their voice letters.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we were in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years, a chooser in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zorev, his wife of Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice to the general election in the form of the state that would open the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica, September 30 September 2018.
In front of the parlement in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years, has been preparing a small stage and pulled the chairs in front of the tenta-tends made by those who would risk the votes.
"We agreed to join NATO and European Union, but we want to join in honor, not through the server door" said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Goa integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's body would bring more investation necessary for Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent displacement rates.
"I believe most of the population will agree because more than 80 percent of our society support the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice.
He said "yes" will be "infirm our future."
A list of opinions published by Macedonia’s Ministry Institution on Monday states that between 30 and 43 percent the chooser will be part of the voice - less than the amount it takes.
On another basis, which was held by the Macedonian Telma TV station, found 57 percent of respondent that was planning to follow their voice on Sunday.
From them, 70 percent said it was going to choose yes.
In order to get that voice tax success, it's worth 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure in the voice pickup will represent the first policy on pro-Barat government since taking over in May years ago.

He ran between three defenders Brighton, before the guess goes into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-coats.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of a few more opponents at the end of the Brighton.
Then he hit his left, to Sterling.
The British sling was using his first knot from the gawang direction to go back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Lighton kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gawang.
"Aguero fought with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola manager City to reporters.
"We're talking about him who's playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We buried him on a goal at the time."

Scherzer wants to complain the spoiler versus Rockies
With the Nationals' terelimination of playoff game, there's no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer is too competitioned to be able to meet Colorado Rockies on the Sunday game, but only if there's still a playoff for Rockies, a superior match in Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The most rockies have no place after winning in a wild-card game against Nationals with a 5-2 score on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Even though we were playing without winning, at least we can't figure out the mood in this Denver with the crowd and the other team that would compete at the highest level of any point that I might face this year.
How can I not be competitioned in such games?"
Nationals haven't announced the opening competition for Sunday, but reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join.
Scherzer, who will start a laga for 34 times, have a practice session on Thursday and start the Sunday game used to rest.

Trump's camped in West Virginia.
The President is clearly referring to a situation that involves the candidate of the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of the development of the Republican community in the middle of the selection.
"All the effort we've done was held in November.
Five weeks before they run the most important selection in our lives.
This is one of the big ones -- big -- I don't really run that's why I fight in all the places for a wonderful candidate," he said.
The Trump continues," you see a group of very special radicratal Democrats, you can see it happen right now.
And they decided to take back the power in any way, you saw the evil, their fame.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to be able to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democratic, he says, is in a mission for "rejecting and blocking."
"And you saw it for the last four days," she called the Democrats "murd and evil and untrustable."
He was referring to the Senate Dianne Feinstein Senate in the Senate Court Committee by mentioning his name, which was received with the hard cement of his listeners.
"Remember what's the answer?
Do you overwrite the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it--it's a very bad body language-- the worst language I've ever seen."
Work Force party is no longer a public service place.
Now it's becoming a spirit to anyone who's making his mind.
When the Momentum activist in my local party gives a voice to identify myself, it's not surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of the Parlemen’s members, told that our presence was not expected - all of it because we were considering it.
My brother in the parliament, Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he held an antisemitism strong.
In my case, the threat movement criticizes me for not having a deal with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, ironic issues are the same as Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to the former leader.
Notifications for the East Nottingham labors meeting on Friday says that "we want to be a exclusive and productive meeting."
For almost eight years I became members of the local Buruh Parlemen, a general Comite meeting on the Friday night exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about politicals that are better, more friendly than have been forgotten, if, it's ever begun.
The difference in the labor party has become more evident to not tolerated and each of the opinions of its credentials by the party authority.
It began as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as the colega I thought would be able to share the same political view, starting to expect me to go back and take a position that I would never be able to accept-- well in national security or a single European market.
Whenever I speak openly - and I don't care what I say-- then it's going to be followed in social media that asked for a dedication, consulting central political, telling me that I shouldn't report on the Buruh party.
And it's not just me who's going through it.
Of course, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because my comments were directed to me tend to polytics.
I admire my professionalism and collaboration of my colleagues who face sexual or racism every day but never stops.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claims that Buruh's party was supposed to help develop the culture of the respiratory.
The fact is that we're no longer in the larger church and with every motitit of "untrusted" or changing the selection of partition rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice for two years ago that pushed me to keep my head down, not too expressing opinions, and then I'll say "good."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined in Buruh 32 years ago when still was a school student, recommended by the abduction of the Thatcher government that resulted in my comprehensive class literally destroyed, I've been trying to sell better public services for those who really needed it -- well as a local counselor and the minister in the government.
I never hid my political action, including the last selection.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things that I don't agree in the leadership right now.
For those who encourage mosi on Friday, what I can say is when the country moves quickly to the division of the sovereignty, it's going to risk our country and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy in loyalty to the leader of Buruh.
But really, my message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituent, as a member of Buruh or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unexpected Ayr goes up to the top position
The last two trials may have been a little bit of the end results, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennent's preconditionships that are so comforting today.
Now they're on the top order, the only side that's not even the ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to attain the best chances, which made the homelord and coach Peter Murrchie get the right to be happy.
"So far we've been testing our game, and we're still not at it so we feel happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "The appreciation for Ayr, they're better at taking a chance than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in 14th minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but yellow card for the Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given to that game by Warriors, gave a chance for Melrose to print the number and Jason Baggot to the unconversited experiment.
Climo's tied up Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of the time, he printed a gol and then performed a single experiment to make Ayr score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose began the middle of the second and Patrick Anderson experiments changed by Baggot, reduced the chance to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound out, and since it started back to the game, Ayr quickly crossed the Stafford McDowall experiment, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got hit by yellow cards and again, Melrose made a backup player pays with a recent Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The house has returned to play, will but, when Struan Hutchinson got yellow cards for climosing without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived in the back of Ayr wounded.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe was doing a gawang constraint and broke the five of the boxer Gregor Henry.
The Star Still Game looks ready to live his new career in the restaurant industry.
The Star Still Game Kieran appears to be ready to move a course to the service industry after he had known that he was obliviated as an director of a convention restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis who was 56 years old at the popular event of Tenavar, who was extracted, and also stared with his old comrade, Greg Hemphill.
The couple had announced that the serial to nine is the last episode, and it seemed that Krenteran was planning to drive a live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to a list of official recordings, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment a story, even though a Scottish Sun source claim that the Criteran was trying to get involved in "the developing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“ Laut is ours: a land surrounded by land, hoping that the court will return to the Pacific.
The fighter did patrols at the large force base that was located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Navy base of Titicaca to Amazon waspoled with moto: "Sub is our right.
To rise back is a duty."
Through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, still like a desire for once again to fight the Pacific Samudra.
The hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a court sentence on October 1, after a five - year battle.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope about the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat Bolivia.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial across the wide screen of the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that-- after a few decades of negotiations declare it -Chile is obliged to protest the security of Bolivia on the ocean.
Evo Morales, President of Bolivia, who had a kontroversial war for next year's birthday selection -- also has much support on Senin's trial.
"We've been very close to the Pacific Ocean, he swore at the end of August.
But some analys believe that the court can't decide Bolivia's desires-- and it's just gonna change a little if it allows.
The U.S.A. has no power to hand over Chili's territory, and has already set that it won't decide the result of negotiations.
That ICJ's sentence came only six months after the last argument that was heard, which indicates the case "unciently," said Paz Zárate, a member of Chili international law.
And still far away from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the past four years, it's probably just going to have a resignation.
"Stay access to the sea is already called Bolivia's government now," said.
Morales's aggressive retoria has weakened the good ktikad from the rest of Chili's people, he says.
Bolivia and Chili at a certain point will remain negotiating, but it's going to be very difficult to keep a discussion after this.
The two countries haven't changed the big duta since 1962.
The president of Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the government of Bolivia in Den Haag refused a decision-out idea.
The day Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chili and a chance to end 139 years of opinion with profit together, he says.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales- still one of the most famous American president of Latin is using maritim issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release his rights to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"It's a chance to see if we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear warping won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
The North Korea State Minister Ri Yong Ho said the first country would never rob a nuclear weapon if Korea can't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday when the United Nations Congregation.
He mentioned about the United States doing a deal made at the meeting in Singapore between the leaders who are competing each other.
His comment appears when the Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompeo seemed almost to start a nuclear diplomacy that has been buried for over three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "a dream" that by continuing the sanction and the A.S. collision against the declaration of the Korean War solution would give up North Korea.
Washington was careful to approve that declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to the armed force's limit first.
Well Kim and President U.S. Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that the Pyong who really is about the confession of the weapon storehouse for the country is the only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode display shows a lot of new heads cover collections to your main path near you
If you want to multiply a collection of hats or really want to protect from the sun's light, don't find anyone else.
Desainer Valentino and Thom Browne took out a series of large size covers for their SS19 collections in the mode stage with the style held in Paris Fashion Week.
A really unfinished hay hat has been sweeping Instagrams in this summer and these designers have been watching the chreasis that enacted the eyes on the crowd stage.
The point of Valentino is a crem color hat that's decorated with the wide edge of the hair-bank that covers the head of the model.
A large size accessory includes a piece of diamonds, a witch hat and even a nanas, but it's not made to warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed me a bunch of weird masks and right through Halloween.
A lot of colored masks that have been sewed and looked just like Hannibal Lecter instead of couture haute.
A kreasile of snorkels and glasses, while others look like a melting ice cream.
And if you continue to trace the collection of the akbar mode-- then you're being buried.
The registration of the modes estimate that the collection of large hats will be passed on to the main road near you.
The large hat-topis became a very ranch at the 'La Bomba', a hat with a wide edge of two feet visible to all people, including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label test behind the hat that is very practically practical about social media makes a large cremation in the coastal catwalks of the bigrami is almost equal to the swimwear -- used with the intersection model.
Tas rafia jingga burned, dug with a rafia on the edge with a white handle, is an outstanding thing from the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
"I wish to see the big hat and the coast tas arrived on the main road for the next summer - 'cause the designer has made a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the request for such a large accessory'
John Edward: The language skills are very important to global citizens.
Skotlandia's private School is keeping a trace of academy struggles, and this continued in 2018 with a remarkable test, which is further reinforced by every student and collaboration in sports, art, and music and hard effort.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland School Council (SCIS) endeavoring to provide the best services for students and parents.
The managing school is designed to prepare his students for further education and higher, their choice career, and their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can predict and implement the riculum of the school according to what is expected, we see the modern language continue to be a popular and wants in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, you say you're going to get into his head.
If you talk to him in his language then your speech will go into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test results of this year, we can see that the language is the top position of the liga table with the highest graduation value in the law school.
Total 68 percent students who learn foreign language get A Plus's value.
The data has been gathered from 74 SCIS students who show that 72 percent students get the value of A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German language, 69 percent of them who learn French and 63 percent that learn Spanish too.
It shows that the school is at Scotland supporting a foreign language as an important skills that are likely to be required by children and teenagers in the future.
Now, in the language, as an eye options, are held in the same standard as the STEM study eye (sains, technology, engineers and mathematical) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey performed by the British Ministry and Ministry in 2014 found that from some reasons why workers should continue to fight out the lowong, 17 percent why it was a lack of speaking skills.
Therefore, the language skills are increasingly recommended to prepare teenagers for their careers in the future.
As a result of the more opportunities for speaking, this skills are important in today’s global world.
Whatever the choice of someone's career, if they've learned the second language, in the future they're going to feel real benefits because they have a lifetime of such skills.
It can communicate directly with a foreign country will automatically create a superior multibahasan in competition.
According to the review YouGov on over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign enough to do French speech and language the only language that is spoken in two percent, which is 15 percent.
This is why investation in language lessons for the children now is important for now.
Having multi-bahasa abilities, especially countries with developed economics, will provide children with a better chance to find a meaningless job.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern, while others will teach the language that is most important in England for a few years next, which is 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in the law school, with the instructor staff in this field.
Skotland's master was intended to provide a study environment that will prepare the children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
Can't be held out that now, in global business environment, the language will always be important in setting the future for the country, so it must be developed in education.
In fact, modern language must be really considered " international communication skills."
The law school will continue to offer a choice, apee, and this constraint for Skotlandic teenagers.
Il faut bellen le faire.

General Trump Jadwal in West Virginia, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump was starting with the public campaigns tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first common meeting of Trump of five generals scheduled in the next week, including the stop in some of the fun places that covers Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the voice tax was delayed so that he could choose the office of the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build his support for a general election of time coming because the Republic’s risking riskal control if the vote was done in November.
What time is Trump's common meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch in the back?
Trump's general Rapat at Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's general meeting in West Virginia directly through live broadcasts in YouTube.
It's possible that Trump will discuss the congregation this week for the candidate of the Cret Kavanaugh Court, which is becoming more tense after the insurred sexual accusations and the estimate of the Senat voice would be delayed until a week while the FBI investigated it.
But the primary goal of this general interconnection is to help the Republic's party to get some momentum in the face of November's general election.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump mentioned that five general communications in the next week were meant to "saming volunteers and support for the Republic's party trying to protect and expand the majority they held in the Senat and DPR," according to the Reuters.
"Kontrol is very important for his agenda so that the president may travel to the state as long as we face the busy campaign season," the Trump campaign speaker who refused to mention his name delivered to Reuters.
It was scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a general meeting tonight was expected to be able to present the support of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull the liputans from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 points percenttase in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia candidates from the Republic's party that was left in the court of opinion.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president has to come as an effort to improve it in the opinion degree," said Simon Haeder, politicians at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The United States team has the courage to defend his hope in facing a single Sunday game.
After three sessions of one-sided, the foursome Saturday afternoon is that may be necessary in these Ryder Cup.
A momentum bandulum was the concept of sports that was fully trusted by players, and there was nothing more than this competition.
What do they think is the momentum right now?
"Before, they're superior six points and now four, so I think we've considered it a little momentum," ujar Jordan Spieth was passing that day.
The European has the advantage of four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, like Spieth, feels like they have a little momentum and they have many things that can be a spirit, not except for Spieth and Justin Thomas who plays together all day and each prides three of four points.
Spieth has started off from the tee area to the green area and lead with intelligence.
The parallels that the paraxes are getting stronger when the turn comes, made a big shot of putting up a series when he and Thomas lost two opponents.
The strikes of her who wins them at the 15th number received with similar screams, the screams who tell you that she's sure she doesn't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes that have to be marked.
The only player with more poins than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unforgettable story from Ryder Cup.
A unique couple but interesting from Europe is four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't beat bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also get away from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow well and from this rigged crowd that convinced that they were a player that had to be defeated on Sunday, and there was no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who would lock Europe's potential on the day of Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time both are placed in a different hole.
Still, it's too early to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson insinuating Sergio Paulus's job, four-ball heroes in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double on front nine like digging a hole that will never be mounted by the Spanish golf player and the Swedia.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are a good show to look closer to each couple because of interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change for a while.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way to the final day, but foursome sessions also indicate that the U.S. team had the guts to match any question by some sides, especially in the United States.
Europe superior 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage on the final Ryder Cup after rising from a fourball game and foursome Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victory on Tiger Woods who had to fight holding their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain tropfi that hadn't been able to be found in Hazeltine two years ago, invested a wrong American team in fourballs the morning, made this series to be 3-1.
The United States gave more fights in foursome, winning two competitions, but they couldn't reduce Defisions.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to maintain tropfi.
Fleetwood is the first European dust that wins four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who was called "Molliwood" after the end of the Sensasional weekend, only the second pair who won four points of their four openings in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they were very solid to beat Woods who had pens and the dust of the American Bryson Dechambeau with more strictly 52,0004.
Woods, who forced himself through two competitions on Saturday, once bright but he lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rest on fourballs in the morning, then come back to pairing with Henrik Stenson in foursomes and lose 2 centimetres1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Europe didn't reach itself even though the day was fun and angry in the west of Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set minus measure for America with two points on Saturday.
They've got the 2rd wins that are interesting on Jon melatih1 and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourballs and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 PAGE3 in foursomes after losing the first two hole.
Only twice happened in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returned from the four points of poin into a single game, though as a champion of Furyk only needs a series poin to maintain astrofi.
However, after being the second best for two days, the attack behind Sunday appears to be beyond them.
North Korea says that there's no way's going to disarm the gun by the side without any trust
On Saturday, the North Korea minister delivered to the United States about the sanction that constantly developed their trust in the United States and it may not have been a part of his nuclear weapon in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho delivered to the General General Majelis of the world's world's body that North Korea had taken the "steps of signifies that show good intentions" last year, like stopping nuclear test and misilsection site, breaking nuclear test site, and promised that it didn't develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Namun, we don't see any proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances we can't be rid of our own weapons first."
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistant in the approach to descriptive form where North Korea would be punished for taking a step of speech, the signifiation declared that they didn't completely reject what Pyong was done in the past.
Ri refers to the statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump were on the top meeting between the president of the United States president and the new North Korea leader was held in Singapore on 12 June, then Kim promised to work out "denukalization of Korea" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea has wanted the end of the 1950-53 War ending, but the United States said that Pyong who had to stop his nuclear weapon first.
Washington also refused a call for an international sanction on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on "denuk shaped first" and increased pressure with a semi sanction gift toward their destination forcely, and even refused "the end of the war," "jar Ri.
"Persions that sanction can make us beat the knee is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the sanction will further increase our confidence."
Ri didn't mention the plan for the second top meeting between Kim and Trump who was enclosed by the United States leader in the First Nations union this week.
The minister even recorded three meetings between Kim and South Korea's head of Moon Jae-in in the last five months and adds: "If the problem in this decreasing is South Korea and not the United States, the descriptions of Korea won't find this kind of buntu."
However, the tone of Ri's dramatis was different from the last year, when he spoke to the United Nations Congregation that targeted North Korean rockets on the States land was a thing that couldn't be parsed after "The President of Devil" Trump called Kim "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations meeting, the Trump who threatened to destroy North Korea completely, added praise to Kim for his courage to take a step to distraught, but the great work still has to be done and the sanction has to be done to the North Korea do the descriptive.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time for this, "If this would have two years, three or five months-- no problem," he said.
Tiongkok and Russia think that the U.S. Security Hall has to punish Pyongyang for the taking steps.
However, the Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, delivered to the United Nations Security House on Thursday that: "Starity arrangement must be kept firm and can't fail until we know that the decreasing is full, final andverified."
Security Hall with a round sound increases sanction for North Korea since 2006 as efforts to stop the imperial nuclear program and the Pyongistic misilistics.
Pompeo met Ri at the U.S. University Majelis and said that after that he was going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second top meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there was actually a progress, only North Korea in the jam count that he made himself a "truth like gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with the moon this month to disarm the missile location and also nuclear complex if the United States took a proper action.
He said that Kim told him to do the proper thing with his desire is the guarantee of security that Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalization of relationships with Washington.
About taking a course of rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all the students of S1 there sleep more, in a way against the macho culture in learning that's developing through the cafe human bird's owl.
A academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything about it if it's very fundamental about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of specialists in the medical school and specialists in Brigham and Women's Hospital, designing course, which he believed was the first of his type in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving the lectures about a lack of sleep on the study.
'In the end of the girl came to me and said, 'Why have I just been told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of my sleep - which surprises me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The first launched Kursus this year, explained to students about the esensi from how good sleep habits helps academy results and athletes, and fix their general well.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrist in Harvard Medical School and director of university medical services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who's very poor sleepout all week.
Kursus for an hour this thing involves an interactive task series.
In one session there was an image of the boardroom, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of caffeine and lights, and how the outcome was affected by the lack of sleep, and the routine of sleep.
In other parts, participants received an explanation of how long lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then push participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the behavior of students in an instant.
But we're convinced that they have the right to know-- just like you have the right to know the effect of selecting cigarettes on health,' immigrating Prof Czeisler.
The culture was proud of still there, his vein, added that modern technology and pressure continue to increase at students which means a lack of sleep is a constant problem.
Assuming you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a secret weapon to resist stress, anxiety, and anxiety -- even to avoid weight additions, because the lack of sleep makes the brain enable hunger mode, cause the hunger to continue.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California residents who studied chemicals and physical biologicals that helped Professor Czeisler designed the course, had taken one of his class last year in Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire college.
The next step, he was hoping that the entire test student would be generated to complete the same study program before being joined with a competitional institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider for the sleep alarm, as well as the alarms wake up, and realize the effect of the effects of ‘ blue light' that's flowed by electronic screens and the podcast lights, which can ritme your sirkadians out of the line until the cause of sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol to lower the mental force of Gerrard
Again, Rangers felt the grief of the day when Dolly attacked the team of Steven Gerrard that was scattered at the defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
Tim Hebox tried to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 victory in February of St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as managers, causing his team to lose eight points from the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Investigating seven minutes before the first round is over and the rookers who are out of mind don't seem to be mined.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingston goes to the third position, just left the gol of Hibernian.
And so there'll be more trouble at the Rangers' fortress after Calum Spence's lineman must be treated because of a wound on the head after a object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that ripped Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costumes that took their fights at every opportunity.
Rangers may have a ball possession, but Livingston uses the ball that they have better.
They should've been writing a score in two minutes when the first short bait was cast by Scott Pittman through the McGreor's Gulf, but the loop was pulling that big chance too wide.
The poor Jacobs' free kick that was in there and met Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow can only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers took control but apparently there's more hope than their game at the third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get the penalty when he and Steven Lawless were putting on a quarter of hours but Steven Thomson refused to banding this community of Colombians.
Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first chapter but the bodyguard of Hebox earlier, Liam Kelly, almost never bothered with Lasana Coulibaly's headline and Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening gol at the34 minute may be opposed to the way of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to overcome a deep Jacobs dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher puts the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained quiet chose to hold on for a simple end.
Gerrard acted during a break by changing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost affects when the wing player puts the ball on Morelos but Kelly's playing tracking quickly out of the line to kick.
But Livingston continues to force the local team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweep all the longballs.
The Holt team should be widening them at the final stage but McGregor stood well to drive Jacobs before Lithgow hits wide from the corner.
The member of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claiming punishment again when he differs with Jacobs, but again Thomson is turning face.
Almanac: Geiger Sigger
And now from the page of the Almanac morning, our September 30th, 136 years ago, and MASIH BIGEAD... the day when Johannes Wilhelm's future "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, it was a discovery that finally made the device called Geiger's Watcher.
Bells of Coronado film," stared by cowboy scientists who seemed less convinced that Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's Sigger, used to find radioactive mineral location, such as uranium.
When using this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atom passed by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Don't say, it's gonna matter now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that keeps his name alive.
New cancer Vaksin teaches the imunciation system to ‘ know' bad cells
The new cancer Vaksin taught the imun system for 'knowi' bad cells and kill them
Vaksin taught the imun system to recognize the evil cell as part of the treatment
The method involved the process of extracting the imunciation cell from the patient, turning it into the laboratory.
They then got 'knowi' common proteins in many cancers and then they're injected again
A experimental vaccine shows a promise to patients with various cancers.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which taught the imuncient system to recognize the evil cell, his ovarium cancer is gone for over 18 months.
This method involves a patient's extraction process, turning it into the laboratory so that they get "knowi" proteins that are commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cell again.

They said, 'Don't come out with that hat.'
They're covering me!

He's free.
So do we," plus it.

Maxine Waters argued that the staff has decomposed Senator GOP's data, spread 'the dangerous lies' and 'theor of the conspiracy'
The Indians of Maxine Waters on Saturday argued that one of his staffs has sent three private senator Republicans to the page of Wikipedia parliament.
The Los Angeles Democrat Party menegaskan that the claim was moved by scholars and websites "ultra-right wing".
"The lie, lies, and many more desperation lies," says Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that self-reported information include home address and the phone number of the United States, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all of Utah.
The information came out on the day of Thursday, sent by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill during the Senat panel's congregation regarding the illegal conduct of the Supreme Court of Brettt Kavanaugh.
This Bocoran showed up shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reports that the IP address identified the source connected to the Waters' office and reveal the information of one of the Waters staffs, Hill reported.
"It's not really wrong and it's a absolute lie," more Waters.
"My staff - who Identification, personal information, and his safety are threatened by a lie and wrong - not responsible for this information leak.

"It shows that he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
They may not be angry if they are falsely accused of something that is not done.

Johnny English Strikes again - paroin-eyed Rowan Atkinson's bad eyes
Now, looking for a signifiation of Brexit in each new movie with a new view of England has become tradition and it seems to be the appearance of the laodi laga-komedi Johnny English - who started in 2003 with Johnny English and return to 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm syndicate about how bad we are to be a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English who was enacted, rubber face, and not that competent had updated the lisense for the second time - his name gives more guidance than anything that he was a vast comication designed for the language synthetic region than England.
Of course, he is a crazy secret agent who misses his strange suspect, has a little Couseau character, a handful of Mr. Bean and a few travelers that contributed a few records for the Chariots of Fire at the Olympic opening ceremony of London 2012.
Indeed, he was based on tourists and international mysterious men who ever played Atkinson in the Barclaycard TV iklans that are now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this new JE trip.
I like when Johnny English approached the helicopter with a mid-year-old zirah dress and a rotor throw-baling quickly sticking in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical dimedi is shown, but his humor is feeling less powerful and too weird, especially when the film is "serius" like 007 and Mission may have believed to enter a commercial.
His Humor felt like it was meant to be for children from adults, and for me to have many weird English keen innovative English and a focus of film-bisu Atkinson movies in Bean's personality.
Premis who's been warm these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A siber's hacker has been entering a super secret British spy network, exposed the identity of all British agents in the field, to let down the agent who was assigned -- his dear love is just a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for the tyranny minister, who's been completely destroyed to his politically popular: Emma Thompson performs very well with the quaasies-Mayed character but not much that can be considered from his script.
His smart advice gives the information that because every active spy has been disabled, he has to bring one out of retirement time.
And that means that Johnny's own English kikuk, now is promoted as a school head in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson about how to perform the disguise operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers an acquisition like the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for emergency directors and united again with an old friend who had been suffering from Bough, led by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, marrying a submarine commander, a top-class woman who sucks Vicki Pepperdine is a bit oblivious.
So Batman and Robin made mistakes to the Secret Agent return to action, meet the great mystery woman Opheelia Bulletova that Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is worried about falling in the influence of the career’s career technology that claims to solve the problem of the British computer: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventures: disguised as a waiter, they burned French fast restaurants; they made chaos by blowing on Volta's fancy ship; and English triggering anarchy when he tried to use the virtual Reality headset to get used to get used to get yourself interior.
All the stops must be pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and poverty, there's a little bit of the children's TV channels that are full of everything.
It's a pretty moderat thing.
And just as Johnny's other English movie, I can't think: can't the British industry give Rowan Atkinson a real role fit for his talent?
Buruh argued on plans for the British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the United States was considering a radicial plan that wanted the Britishs to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The United States reported that the owners of the company continued to continue the result of the artifisial intelligence revolution for workers by giving them extra vacation days.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend three days... but still get the same price.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pas' with a party economy and plan to move the country to support workers.
Transition to four days a week has been approved by the British Congress Dagang as a way to make the workers feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior from the United States Buruh said to The Sunday Times: 'The review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It's not gonna happen in the last night, but four days of work in a week is a conspiracy that fits the party approach to reproduce the economics that support workers and parties industryal strategies.'
The Buruh party is not the first to support that idea, because the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week on the general election campaign in 2017.
But now the inspiration is not supported by the entire Buruh Party.
The mayor of Buruh's party said: 'Empat days of work in a week is not a party policy and not being considered by party.'
The shadows of John McDonnell used the Buruh conference last week to complete its visotic for socialistic revolutions in economic.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of anonim' and ‘ para chessman' in utilities company.
The plan of this shadow can also mean, the stockholder at the current time in the water company may not be able to get back all the shares because the government of the Buruh's party can do the reduction's for a reason.
He also made sure his plans to put workers in the company board and create the Inklusive Arts that would give 10 percent of the company's equency in private sectors to employees, which would cut out the annual dividement until 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their view
The FBI investigation on Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his final vote in the Court of the Supreme Court at least a week, and the question of what this beero interview could affect the senators of the Republican Republic to remove their support.
In a interview shown on Sunday, the corespond "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republic Department John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy was opener than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, the accusation appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He is the steadfast, determined, firm."
But it seems that Graham would never be able to change.
"My presence has decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and need a greater accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett is arguing it hard," Graham added, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't confirm it.
His age is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changes."
What is the point with the Global National Festival and Did this event have done something to reduce Poverty?
On Saturday, New York will have the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event that displays a very impressive star deretant, and missions that are also effective; end poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global National Festival will be a witness of tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to improve the goal of this event that actually ends the extreme poverty in 2030 years.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the continuing of Global Poverty Project, a international advocating group that hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fight against poverty.
In order to get free tickets for that event (or you want to pay the VIP ticket), the concert visitors must complete the task's debate or "action" as volunteers, send an e-mail to the world leaders, call, or other ways to help improve their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen for 12 years in reaching its purpose?
Does the idea of giving a present to a free concert is the right way to invite someone to do something, or just another case called "clicktivism" - people feel like they're doing a real difference by signing an online mailbox or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Warn says it's been recorded over 19 million " witness" from their supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped the world leaders to announce commitment and policy with more than $37 billion that would affect more than 2,25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their action, at least ten billion of them have been distributed or made for funding.
This group calculates the safe funds so far has given a direct impact at nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major commitments between the Power of Nutrition, a homeless camp of England which consisted of investors and implements for "helping children to grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the loss of the country after receiving more than 4.700 tweets of the Global Army.
"With the support of the British government, the maintainer, the national government, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about the lack of this gizi is a note in history," the Power of Nutrition, the Tracey Ullman said to the crowd of the crowd when the concert was directly in London in April 2018.
This group also says that after more than 5,000 acts done to increase nutrisi for the mother and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutritiion, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrisi.
Think of one of the questions in the General Answers on their websites who asked "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens said, "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, the same as civil rights movements and great anti-partheids that were already there before us, we're going to work, because if we're united, we're going to get stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is a few of the stars that show in New York, which will be traced by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as "blokade" to enslave the Russian energy export - Secretary In State
"If needed" Washington can ask the Navy to prevent the Russian energy to reach the market, including in the Middle East, the Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke revealed, as was quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke suspects that the Russian involvement in Syria - especially, where it operates on a valid government invitation - is a diversion to explore the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they were in the Middle East is that they wanted to be a energy variance, just as they did in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reported.
And, according to that office, there's a way and a suggestion to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure the open seaway, and, if necessary, to do blockade, to ensure that their energy can't go into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the event attendees held by the Aliansi Energi Consument, a group of nudba who called himself "a energy customer" in the United States.
He compared the approach that Washington has done in the deal with Russia and Iran, to see that in the same effecttity, they are the same.
"The economic options in Iran and Russia are less than, use and replace fuel," he said, as well as referring to Russia as one of the "the experts in the field" with economics that depending on the material of the fosil fuel.
This statement appears when the Trump governmentships are doing missions in order to increase their fuel exports to Europe, replace Russians, a much cheaper choice for clients in Europe.
For that, the Trump government officials, including the President of the U.S. Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull herself out of the oil pipe project Nord Stream 2 "unless," which is following Trump, made Berlin as "awan" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the oil factory project of Nord Stream 2 worth $11 billion, designed to double the size of the oil factory capacity that is available to 110 billion meters of this quabik project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's hard fight against this project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy can't be made of tools to do the pressure and that customers should be able to select themselves the Russian minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the U.S.S. Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. spirit has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has convinced their commitment to this project.
German - industrial industrial organization, Federal of Germany (BDIes), has asked the U.S. to not interfere with Europe’s energy policy and a formal agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I'm going to face a big problem if the third country is meddling our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between the German Kanselir between Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.

On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he was going to die for the situation when calling himself as president after the selection of time.
When the camping at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he'll consider it to call himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bobrok government, including putting women in the top position," as he said to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll see a situation when I call myself as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when it was camped in the city hall, saying that he was "to bring this area to the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren blakts in presenting his critics against Trump and leader of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need the FBI investigation before doing a vote."
However, a self-recognizing question on Thursday day, indicated that most of the candidates itself don't want him to call himself at 2020.
Fifty eight percent of "perhaps" chooser in Massachusetts said that the senator should not respond, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Gloobe.
32 percent is supporting the call.
It shows more support to former Governor Deval Patrick for asking himself, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of calling himself and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democrat Party that were present in regard to the possibility of calling themselves in 2020 including the former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Finch Sanders.

Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin at the time of Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a violent incident in a household on Monday night.
"What my son has experienced, what he will experience when he comes back, I can connect with other families that also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers have experienced," said in front of the audience that were present in the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 states, D.C. support the challenge of the new suaka policy
Eightteen parts and Districts of Columbia support law challenges against the new U.S. policy that refused bribes for victims who escaped from gangs or violence in the household.
The representation of 18 parts and districts offered a brief friend-of-the-court on Fridays in Washington to support those suaka searchers, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v's competitor in the session of American Liberties Union in August of federal policy has not been understood.
He said his fellow "and his son who was a ruthless gang," had struck him, but the U.S. government refused his approval on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state of the state supporting Grace describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a cover of silk with a large amount for the U.S., as a country with a big problem with gang and violence in a household.
The new U.S. directors left behind with the decision of the Imigran Imigran Council of 2014 that allowed dark imigranes to escape the violence in the household to offer a suaka.
The Great Jaksa District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "relict the law of the state, federal, and internationals that have been available for a few decades."
"The federal command requires that all suaka chlaims must be decided according to the fact and certain conditions related to the klaim, and such bans as violated principles," friend-of-the-the court says he's brief.
More often, the reasoning of the policy that refuses to escape the loss of the U.S. economy, says that they're probably going to be a businessman and "condition the necessary work force."
The Great Jaksa Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered an immigration judge to give the victims away from violence in the house of gang and violence.
"It is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of racism, religious, nationalism, or sociality in social groups, or certain political opinion," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11th.
Suaka is not meant to exaggerate all problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face every day in the world.
A very sad rescue in Palu because the victim is doubled when it races with time to find a safe victim.
For those who survive, the situation's getting worse.
"It was very suggested," said a Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her son-in-law in the city of Palu that was destroyed.
"Every minute an ambulance came bringing a dead body.
The clean water is very rare."
Warga appears to be back to their broken house, taking the stuff that flowed through the water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people are wounded and treated in hospitals, damage caused by 7,5, are very fucked.
Some of them were wounded, including Dwi Days, who were suffering broken backs and shoulder, lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a strong milking earthquake.
His eyes were flowing when he told him how he felt when an earthquake hit the floor room five of his place to stay with his wife and daughter.
"There's no chance to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruin of the wall," Days said to Asciated Press, he added his family in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cried for help, and then I was quiet.
I don't know what she and my son are.
May they be safe."
The U.S. Duta accuses Tiongkok's "do amidation" with 'the propaganda'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper contains a four - page advertisement in an U.S. day which calls the advantage of the US-Tiongkok trade, a large U.S. duta for Tiongkok claiming Beijing using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. Donald Trump on Wednesday, which refers to the production of China Daily Des Moines Register - the British news in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiongkok was trying to interfere in the U.S. selection on the 6 Nov., a accusation that Tiongkok had been spoken by Tiongkok.
The Trump claim that Beijing tried to interfere with the selection in the United States, which marked what the U.S. office said to Reuters, is a new phase in the campaign that Washington was doing to press Tiongkok.
Although there's something common to the foreign government to put a commercial to promote trade, at this time Beijing and Washington are trapped in a constant trade war, which makes them raise the level of the importor one another.
Tarif of Tiongkok's vengeance at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit the exporters in the state of Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Republic, said the experts of Tiongkok and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, the great U.S. duta for Tiongkok and former old governor led Iowa, the main farm-based materials to Tiongkok, said Beijing had lost the workers, farmers, and business workers in America.
Tiongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "Now double that identification by running the propaganda advertisement on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Tiongkok government used the tradition of freedom of speech and a very precious press freedom in America by carrying a bill on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Really, in the kios-kios sales of the street newspaper here, in Beijing, you will find a limit to different voices and will not see the actual mirrors of different opinions that may have been owned by the Tiongkok econgkok econgkok econgkok econgkok, remember the media under the control of the Tiongkok Commungkok Party," wrote it.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tiongkok refused the offer to publish" his article, although he didn't mention any news letters.
Analiss Warn, Republicans Recognition From women's Selector by the Time of Kavanaugh Disease
Since the scenes of important people in the Republicans who stand and defend the leaders of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in facing some sexual violence charges, analis have warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, at the general election of the time coming.
The Emosi on this problem is very high, and most members of the Republic are noted have already shown that they want to move forward to the vote.
It can't be stopped," Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Didier School,usa University said to The Hill for a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the Senator's motivation (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake at the end of the minute to do the FBI's research would be enough to tolerate anger on the chooser.
"Wanita won't forget what happened yesterday-- they won't forget it tomorrow, and neither will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior counselor and a national talker for the progressif company said it on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrans tapped "November," when they made a demonstration on the Senate hall when the Republic controls the Justice Committee to continue forward in the trial of Kavanaugh miss out of the testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Antusiasme and democracy motivations will be out of the list," non-partistist Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"The people say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women's voters in the area of the edges and younger chooser, 18 to 29 years, which because they don't like the president, often don't give voice."
Even before the public witnessing of Ford that would explain sexual disorderly against himself by the leader of the Supreme Court, analis advise the attack that followed if the Republic’s Republic's party was to move forward with confirmation.
"It was a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chief of the Republican National Commissioner, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the chemite selection or the end of the sound selection or whether Kavanaugh will be placed at the reserve seat, it's also about how the Republic dealt with this problem and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director Priorities USA, a group that helps to select the Democrat Party, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans, however, seem to be divided about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little choice that would prefer to the last one.
A new opinion that YouGov did show that 41 percent of respondent really believed or maybe trust in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were really confident or maybe trust in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent says they feel Kavanaugh maybe or really lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a push from Flake, the FBI is investigating the accusations that Ford and one of the other, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.

The World Wide Web Publishing to Start New Internet to manage Google and Facebook
The Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wiide Web, launch a start that's trying to feed Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Firm.
Tears allow the user to select where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind the Insurgen is "domination of the world."
"We have to start now," he said from startup.
"This is a historical moment."
This application uses technic technology that allows people to keep "a personal online data" or their POD on their own.
This store can contain contact list, task list, calendar, music library, and other personal and professionals.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that's all available in one browser and everything at the same time.
Which is unique from this personal data storage is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company is known as "a personal force through data."
The idea to establish Ingrut, according to John Bruce's company CEO, is that the company designed resources, processes, and skills that are right for help to get the firm ready for everyone.
Now, this company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms bought by IBM, some staff developers that are contracted to work on the project, and the community volunteering codes.
Starting this week, technology developers all over the world can create custom application desentralized using available tools on the Web site of Ingret.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether it's going to introduce or not a total change where all their business models would actually be turned around in last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a posting in Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Insect's system is to provide energy and ecosystem commercial ecosystems to help protect integrity and quality from the new web built up on stitch."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he built the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become a powerful voice in network debate neutrality.
Even when launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Foundation Web, and Open Institute Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorate WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War First as a fighter, held in his birth state 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the credit on September 29, 1918 on the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by the shooter and never knew that he had won the highest military honor.
A warning stone was described by the two grandsons on a parade at Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said this was the rock of intelligence that would express exactly 100 years of grandpa's achievement wins award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his batalion across the Kanal de Saint-Quentin "boiling a very thick seaming under a gun of field weapons and machines."
And then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "the greatest success" lead the front line before he rushed using a field weapon alone and beat three detasemen.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German shooter on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years, said his grandfather's actions are "the things I know that I can't live but is a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he's "a very honored to participate in this parade" and added "a true hero is being shown with support that will be given by many people."
The MMA MMA's racer was all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got the Pig Peppa.
Imagine this, you've been looking all night to watch the Bellator full of 206 just to refuse to watch the main event.
The Tagihan of San Jose has 13 fights, including six in the main card and is being shown directly all night in England at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., exactly when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, the audience in England was made to be stunned when the cover turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel worthless after they've been in the middle of a special day for the fight.
A fan in Twitter describes the change to the children's cartoon film as a irritious "lelucon."
"This is a government rule, that at six o'clock the constant morning it doesn't fit to show, so it was replaced with the children program, "at Dave Schwartz, the president of the Bellator's senior and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Papa the pig," yes.
President Bellator Scott Coker said that they'll fix their schedulers by marking the audience in England at the time of the end.
"To me, if we think about reinstatement, I think we might be able to solve it," said Coker.
"But at this time there at six o'clock in the week and we won't be able to fix it until the Sunday of our time, the Monday day of their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at a time of change, a lot of ballk-back text and everything doesn't teach me.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're just going to reduce up to five fights from six fights-- as we usually do-- and we're gonna try to avoid overdue for fans, and we succeed.
It's an invincible state."
Tom Daley's feeling low about sexuality.
Tom Daley's Olympic rescueer says he grew up with humility because of his sexuality--but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man says he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "no one like me."
Speaking for the first time at Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about the rights of homos to give "hop" for others.
He also said to be an old man make him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
A regular shower brought this long walk, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off for sick.
Tampil as the people who think about the first program Laverne, Daley said he felt "no longer than" everyone else who grew up with him because "nothing can be accepted socially to love men and women."
He said, "The feeling today is a little less than others, and different feelings, has become real things that give me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was " Something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they knew about his sexuality.
These two Olympic artifacts have been a famous LGBT campaign and used his appearance in Common Games this year in Australia to draw more countries in order not to do discrimination against homossuals.
He said, he was talking because he felt lucky to live without consequences and wanted to give someone else a wish.
The champion of the world three times said it fell in love with a man - filmmaker from US Dustin Lance Black, found it in 2013 - "thank me."
Daley married Oscar's wife who was 20 years older than this last year, and she said that she was not a problem.
"When you experience so much problems at a very young age" - she followed her first Olympic at 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age which had the same skeleton.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me a year ago, all around 'I have to win the gold medals'," he said.
"Will you, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold Medali is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last thing he asked was if they had got tickets for London Olympic 2012-- because he wanted to sit in the front line.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit in the front of my father's front line," he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until she died, at last I admitted that she was unattainable," he said.
The next year Daley compiled on the 2012 Olympics and won the battle.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamed through my entire life-- to dive in front of people at the Olympic Game, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
This also inspired his first song option - Proud by Heather Small - who had joined him in his preparation to the Olympics and still made him lookint.
The Desert Island of Discs is Radio 4 broadcasted on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed the role on Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American competitor Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays the fiveth-7th game, but he has to change the role to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in two annual events to record a 12-time record, served by Captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a group of four on Saturdays.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually did for the United States, this five-time winner divides the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that scale, with hope to fix what he has had to do.
There was never a straightest golf talker even when he was at the top of his career, this 48 years of age did not fit to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which used to give a long and harsh punishment for each wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not quite scary for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, facing the most accurate British champion of Francesco Molinari, who has been working with Tommy Fleetwood's new immigrants to win all of their four games this week.
If this American fighter, start 12 single games with four points below, start it with a hot beginning, then the Mickelson game is proven to be very important.
Furyk declared faith in this man, not because he could say a lot of things.
"He really understood his role today, hit the back and hit me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine he's playing two games.
I imagine the rest of the world, but that's how to play it and that's the way we think we should go through.
He wants to enjoy another mood, just as most people are."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never be able to measure its individual record heights.
Mickelson cut down 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven times, although Furyk says his presence brings some things that cannot be said to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, jokes, funning people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think a younger player has fun with him, this week, too, that's pretty fun to see.
He gave me a lot of things, more than just playing."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows a great battle will soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, learned from experience that someone who was leading big enough to his last single match at Ryder Cup easily could be an uncomfortable trip.
Ande did his first dust in the game 1997 in Valderrama, with the captain of Seve Ballesteros holding five points over America, but it just touched the finis line with their nose with the most thin margin, wins 141131132132.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a great battle in Valderrama; we get a big constraint in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we're winning, but just now," said Bjorn, took a picture, after the Class of 2018, winning 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 National Golf National.
So the history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring match.
Get out and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have targets, and the targets are winning this tropfi, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the rest of the world-- the greatest players in the world."
It's nice to see the players playing in a hard golf field, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never go on alone.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the person player who's going to go ahead, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individual, then your ability is complete as a golf player will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell every player, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you left your partner and he had to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's opponent will ask his player to play better than they do as a Ja pairann, unless for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been at the end of the second end of the great game, has become part of the team that wins in Brookline before it ends with a defeat when Europe does "Furinship in Medinah."
"I remember every word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the momentum goes one direction, it'll give a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in various ways we think, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead a fight against Rory McIlroy on the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonlah, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European player in the top order.
"I went with this group of people with this sort of order because I think I could close all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The German new war ship is suspended back
The new German Navy guards ship should have begun in 2014 to replace an old war warship of the Dingin War, but the ship would not be there until the next year because of the wrong system and the cost was increasing, the local media report.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of a new Baden-Wuerttemberg class guard, has now been suspended to the first lung of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Ze Zeit who applied a military talker.
This ship was supposed to be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the delivery postca has been bothering this ambisius project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg classships called the Sea Force in 2007 will come as subsided by the old Bremen's old Bremen.
This ship will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-sawat missiles, and an anti-head missiles, and some sluman technology, like radar erasers, infrared, and the mestic keys.
Another vital feature included a longer treatment period - should be possible using the latest guards ship for two years far from the docks.
However, the delay of continuing to mean this advanced warship-- which is said to allow Germany to express its power outside the country-- will be shut at the time of the task, Die Zeit record.
The lucky F125 guard ship has been a successate last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to Blohm and Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the crew after the delivery.
It's just a little bit of a reason that was known behind the ship's flight, but the German media quoted a number of "cacat software and hard device" that made the warships not useful if they were used for battle missions.
The softwarecat is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by you by a ship that consisted of 120 sailers-- only half of the work force on an older Bremen classship.
It also tells that the ship’s bobot is so much too much that it's going to reduce its performance and limit the sea Force ability to add the end in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this bobot 7.000 tons are suspected twice as heavy as the ship with a similar class used in the second World War.
In addition to broken hard devices, the production cost of the entire project-- including your training of the ship - is also a problem.
It's said rises up to स3,1 billion ($3,6 billion) - goes up from the beginning of 2 billion.
The problem that weighs this new bodyguard ship has become very important to remember the latest warning of the destruction of the German forces.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parlement committee acknowledges that the Navy is actually "stirred ship with the ability to spread."
The office says when this problem gets growing up, because the old ships are no longer used but no substantial ships are available.
He's sorry that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards can join the Navy.
The National Trust listened to the secret life of bats secretly
The new research was done in a gardening of Skotlandia High Datarane who intended to reveal the way the bat is using nature potatoes in their food hunts.
This interview is hoping to give you a new light about this unique mammal behavior and help drive the gravity of the future.
The study done by scientists in National Trust for Scotland will follow the public cheekstrelle and soprans and chocolate bats in long and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
A special record will be placed in the main location around the property to track the bat activity during the season.
Staf NHS and volunteers will also do celluler surveys using gang-separators.
The voicear that analyzes all recordings will ensure that the bat call frequency and the species are doing what activity.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to make a picture with a scale of nature detecting their behavior.
Rob Godr, a natural counselor for NTS, hope that this results will reveal the area of the habitat which is most important to bat and how each species use it.
This information will help determine what benefits from the environmental work of habitats such as the producer of grass and the best way to keep the forest for bat and other related species.
The bat Population in Scotland and the entire British down sharp in the last few centuries.
This bat is threatened by the development and development work that affects the nest and loses the habitat.
The wind tubs and lighting also cause risks, such as lengket papers that are hung to poison bats and material chemical treatments, and attacks of petty cats.
Actually, bat isn't blind.
However, because his habit was hunting at night, his ears were much more useful than his eyes in the matter to catch prey.
They use advanced gema location techniques to find insects correctly and block in their flying tracks.
NTS, responsible for taking care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant parks, and 76.000 actars of land throughout this country, very concerned about bats.
Have ten trained energy, which routinely performs surveys, nest checks, and sometimes efforts to save.
This organization has also established the first cagar of nature and the only one in the Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is a home for eight of ten species of bat in Scotland.
David Thompson's farming manageer says farming is a suitable area for bat.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bat," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
Yet, there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and the other property will help us to understand more about what they need to grow.
He emphasizes the importance of bat check before doing the maintenance in the property, because without the possibility of an escapeing one nest could kill 400 female bats and still small, which might destroy the entire local population.
Kelelawar was protected and killed, beating, or interrupting, or breaking his nest is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Skotlandia's office for the Reservation of Exelawar Trust, has moved the public to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bat and for many of our species that we don't know how their population fates are."
Ronaldo who refused the rape chlaim is preparing lawyers to request German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape chlaim on himself as "false news," and said that people "in promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer will demand the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
This Portugal and Juventus were accused of raped a American woman, named Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He later expected to pay him by giving him $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking of the lively Broadcast video Instagram to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years, identifying the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is a fake news," the winner Ballon d'Or five times this is saying to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is being prepared to sue Der Spiegel on that accusation, which they call as "report suspicion in the field of privacy which cannot be accepted," according to Reuters.
The Christian lawyer Schertz said that would ask for compensation as "reputation of moral loss in the amount according to the weight of the offense, which might be one of the most serious personal rights in the last few years."
The incident accused of happening in June 2009 in a suite room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to the player's room, where he expected to rape him, according to the report that was placed in the Kabupaten Clark's district in Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo was kneeling down after the incident accused and told him that "99 percent" he was a good man who failed only a percent.
The document says that Ronaldo permits that they both commit sexual relations, but it's over the basis of their desire together.
Majorga also said he went to the police office and had been doing a visum on his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt that he would be afraid to get revenge and worry "will be humiliated in public. "
This 34-year-old woman said she's trying to cancel that peace solution because she's constantly experiencing trauma over the incident that accused her.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack was accused, and this summer he moved to the Italian Juve club with a deal of 100 million.
Brexit: England ‘ will regret forever' for the loss of the carmakers
The British "will regret forever" if he lost his status as the leader of the world as a car produsen after Brexit, said Secretary Bisnis Greg Clark.
He added to the Toyota, England has told — if the British goes out of Europe without a deal, for a while, to stop production at the factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car designer says the impact of the border delay if there's no deal, it's gonna cost Brexit in a job cost.
Pabriks in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 1500,000 cars last year, which was 90% exported to the entire European Union.
"My approval is if England comes out of Europe's Union at the end of March, we'll see the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director Toyota in Burnaston.
Another British car produsen has stated their concern about getting out of Europe without a deal about how traffic traffic will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's gonna shut up the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the carmakers said is the risk of chain supplying if there's no deal with Brexit.
Toyota productions are run by the principle of the "time" production, with the tribe of cadangs coming in every 37 minutes of the founders in England and the European Union for the car to be made according to the order.
If England comes out of Europe's Union without a deal on March 29th, it's probably going to happen at the border, which is based on the industry can cause delay and lack of clans.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies more than one day at the factory in Derbyshire, says the company's intelligence, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for the relationship with the European Union in the future is "recognished correctly to avoid the check on the border."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that I'm going to allow what I say is not only to enjoy the success at this moment, but for us to get this chance," he said to the program today of Radio 4.
"It's not just a Toyota but another producer, too, that we really should be able to continue what's already a chain that's already running very well."
Toyota can't say how long the production would be stopped, but clearly in long-term, warn that the cost addition will reduce the cost of the factory supply and eventually lose the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who's been working in Burnaston for 24 years and was a member of the unite workers manager in the factory, said his member has been more worried: "Blanking my experience, so this job is past, will never return again.
The governmentman said, "We've offered the right and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be back to the point, the White House.
The risk of the high risk of Donald Trump with the great attorney Rod Rosenstein can be "rendan back a week again" because the great courtship of Brant Kavanaugh is still continuing, the White House says on Sunday.
Rosenstein was watching Robert Mueller's special counselor work, who was investigating the Russians in general elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia, and the potential that blocked justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the great defendant or not, who will risk Mueller's freedom, have triggered the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was competing using the telegram to record conversation with Trump and likely to expand the president through 25th safedmen.
Rosenstein objected the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he would resign.
Instead, meeting with Trump, that was at the United Nations office in New York, announced on Thursday.
Trump said he was going to be "chool to fire Rosenstein," but the meeting was turned back to avoid conflicting with the Staten consecution congregation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of having committed sexual immorality, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both will give a witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI investigation for a week over a collim against Kavanaugh, which was next to delay the sound taxing.
Secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, show on Fox News Sunday.
It was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "Banggal for the meeting is not set yet, could be in this week, I can see that resigning it to another better weeks also remember the things that happened in the high court.
But we'll see and I've always wanted to tell the new news to the press."
Some reporters will fight the statement: Sanders haven't held a press meeting in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's shower asked why.
Sanders said it's rare to meet not because of a dissent to TV reporters "who's trying to pull attention," though, he said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to draw attention."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press is lifted.
"Presiden did more of a direct question session than the previous president," he added without mentioning evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, said Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do more and you've seen us do so much in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
routine Trump is asking questions when leaving the White House or sharing in open sessions or press conferences with a high school office visiting.
The solo press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president might show why, do a free appearance and sometimes weird before the reporters gather.

The foreign buyer will be paid for a higher materais when buying property in England
The foreign buyer will be paid for higher materais when they buy the property in England, and the extra money that will be used to help the tunawismasma according to the new Tory plan.
This step will hold the speed of Corbyn's movement in pulling the young chooser.
If this partner's cost will be paid to those who don't pay taxes in England.
The Service Department calculates that it's going to gather up to 8,000120 million per year-to help the tunawisma
The alien buyers will be higher when they buy the property in England-- and the extra money that will be used to help the tunawismasma, Theresa May will announce it today.

Additional fee at the current materes, including a higher level that was introduced for two years ago at the second and the home buyer for renting - could reach three percent.
The Department of Bears expect this move to rise up to 483120 million per year.
It is estimated 13 percent of the property property built in London was bought by non-Inggris population, which caused a price rate and made it more difficult for the first buyer to set his foot on the household.
Many of the rich areas in this country - usually in the capital - have become a ghost town because many foreign purchases spend most of the time out of the country.
This new policy went out only a week after Boris Johnson calls for a cut-off fee to help more young people have their first house.

Corbyn has announced the issue of reformation in an interesting neighborhood, including rented surveillance and ended the "nothing guilty."
He also wanted to give a bigger power to the hall to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "After all, I promised I would decompose the Prime Minister to restore the British dream - that life would have to be better for each generation.
And that means fixing our bobrok housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as companys that have been involved in the land, to buy home as many as the British people have worked hard.
For many dreams to have houses become something far away, and undesirable to unreliable in the land.
My main ambition is leading a Skotland team's team.
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said "the main title" is to be a Skotland manager on some stage.
Skotlandia player is 42 years old, enjoy the challenges of turning back to the North-East club, which is currently taking the third stage in the League One, three points out of the top position.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier Skotlandia last time.
"I want to have my country as a player.
I got B's hat, and it's him," Ross said to Sportsund, Hazel Skotlandia.
"But I'm big and often watching a Skotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been something that pulled me back.
But, the chance will come, if I succeed in the team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross, like this other Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This manan boss Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel scared to follow a large trail of names in that big club, after he refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success of this moment will be measured with 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structures and facilities in this club, there's no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I might only look at myself as a man who works here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in team management only three years, after a couple of time as boss assistants in Dumbarton, and spend 15 months as coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recovered from degradation to the third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation abyss into the championship championship in the next season.
And Ross says now she's more comfortable than she ever had to do during her careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a road intersection that I have to go through," remember it when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure the management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for a living in a reasonable way, and enjoy some of the appropriate things.
But play can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still having it in a job pressure, but in the management seems to be fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I do, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my life."

Looks like people just went out for a drink.
The sales of all the pubs and bars that sell up six6 percent for this month, with which selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, the recreation analyst and the RM hotel said: "This issue goes on the tren we've seen since April.
Weather and the effects of social events or big sports are still the greatest factor on market sales outside the house.
Not surprisingly that the restaurant group kept fighting to survive, even if the drop of 4,8 percent of the year year would be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long summer should not come when the operators sell food through bad times, and time will tell us if the amount of good temperatures that we've enjoyed in August will give a little rest."

The breast pumps that compares mother to cows have been blocking the opinion on the online world.
The boobing company has set up an online opinion with a advertisement that compares to a woman who is inflamed with a cow.
To mark a product launch that is said as "giving boobs that can be used with the first silence in the world," an Elvie’s Tsumen’s consumen’s techisting a iklan inspired from a joke music video to show the freedom of these new pumps to express a mother.

Keeping in mind: "Pompa out, pumps out, I feed them dear, pumps out, pumps out, I milk my lady."
However, the advertisements that have been published on the Facebook page of this company, have caused online controversity.
With 77.000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a different reaction from the embers, with many of which say this makes the "cirration" in the milk industry.

Elvie's breast pump is very pas in BH menyusup (Elvie/Ibu)
Another comment: "Trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise the breast pumps for the mother who has to keep her baby?"
The others add: "A missing commercial."
The other person defended the advertisement, with a woman admitted that she found the song "screaming."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still sucking.
Meneras made me feel exactly like cows.
It's kind of crazy, but I accept what's going on.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
The other is saying, "This is an exciting advertisement for the mothers who are scolding (in their work or toilet) and who feel like "sapi."
This is not a advertisement that commends or judge the milk industry."

Ana Balarin, a mitra and ECD in the mother's head: "Pompa Elvie is a product of a passport which is approved by convincing and provocatif.

In London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared in the catwalk for the village of Martha Jakubowski by using this product.
Hundreds of Migran's Children Move silence-Diam to Tenda Camp in Texas
The number of those who are arrested are increasing in the increasing in the lack of the moon border is still not changed, some of the result of the hard and the policy introduced by the Trump government that biasing children with the experiment.
Basically, most of their own senses are unreliable, and fear harming their own ability to stay in that country by step forward to save children.
Risiko grew up in June, when the federal government announced that the candidates and other adult members of their households were to give up the fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albeence, a senior office in the field of Imother and Bea Cukai, testifying in front of Congress that the board had arrested ten men who offered a request to consult the child under the entrailed age.
The castle then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested had no history of criminal records.
"Hampire 80 percent of people who become a demonstration or a member of the sculpture are in this country illegally, and most of them are bad foreigners.
So we keep hunting those people," he taught Mr. Albeence.
Be advised to process the kids faster, the office introduced a new rule that required some of them to attend the court in a month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which was a standard earlier, a homemade worker.
Most of them are shown through video conference calls, not directly, to request their legal case to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unqualified are going to help at once.
The longer the children are arrested, most likely they're getting anxious or depressed, so that the increase of violence or attempt to escape, the labor workers and the report of the system received in the last few months.
The lawyers say that concern increases in a larger facility like Tornillo, which marks it on a child who is struggling to tend to be ignored, for its size.
They say that moving children to camping cities without preparing enough time for them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can lead a lot of trauma.
Syria asked for a team to take away from the U.S., France and Turkey.
Berpidato in the United Nations Majelis, the Foreign Minister of Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to return, even though the war of the country has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also called the prime minister, said the alien forces are landing Syria with illegally, with the reason to fight terrorism, and "will be dealt with necessarily."
"They have to step back immediately and without asking any conditions," unattained to the exemplified.
Moualem insisted that "the war against the terror is almost complete" in Syria, where more than 360.000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions escape from their homes.
He insisted that Damaskus will continue to hold this sacred battle until we clean out all the Syrian areas of the terror and "the extremity of the illegal foreign army."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and affect Kurdi and Syria's army against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the country that have a war - off area.
About the problem of the refugees, Moualem insisted that they should be right back, and he blameed "how west country" because "creaming great fear" that pushs the refugees to get away.
"We've asked international society and human organizations to complete this return," he taught.
"They're interpolating what should be the complete humanity problem."
The European Union and the United States warns that there will be no support for Syria to be dealt with political agreements between Assad and oporals to end the war.
The U.S. diplomats say the new deal between Russia and Turkey to establish a competition zone in a large fortress of Idlib rebels that have created an opportunity to continue political discussion.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevents the massive attack from the Russian forces supported in the province, where there are three million people living.
But, Moualem insisted that the agreement has a clear time and gives up that military action would target the pharmacies of the Nusra's Front related to Al-Qaeda, who would be killed.
The United Nations Staffan de Mistura has hoped that the first meeting of the new committees consisted of the government and the opolians to make the pasca-sca-sang for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem shows the direction of the Syrian government in the committee, confirming that the work of the panel should be bound to consider the latest parts of the Law, and warn against the interfere.
Why Trump Will Response the Second Periode
According to that logic, Trump will win a general election again in 2020 unless, because many liberal audiences hope, defendant and scandal end the innovationally.
No doubt, "The most dramatic match ever existed!"
Until now, there are no signs of ignorance for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's main clock level is increasing over twice as 1,05 million and MSNBC almost three times to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2,4 million main clock audiences, increasing from 1,7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has inherited the top of a wire TV level with 3,5 million audience on the main news night.
"This is the spirit that makes people interested because of something that has not yet been understood," the Neal Baer, the dramakeeper ABC "Designated Survivor," about the secretary of the cabinet who became president after the attack that destroyed the Oxford.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedi writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: and some hard Truth Inventing to Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered the cab in Boston before the general election was 2016.
The driver said that he would give his voice to Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said," 'cause he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
There's a entertainment value in a mess.
Of course, it's not the same as the other show on TV, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the imigrant family can be united again and restore global economics.
Moves out of it, luxuries that can only be affected by the most special audience.
That's not just being a known citizen when six hours you found yourself watching the panels of "lastback" Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing a camel bomber jacket of Paul Manafort's worth $15,000" "the Washington Post," unpredicted," and it's from the terrible description Stormy of Danielmi Trum.

There's a lot of money from outside the range of the lung selection competition at the White House
It's only Pennsylvania 17 got a flood of money, thanks for the return of the congres district that contributed two maps in the same chairt.
This new Pittsburg section has recently been rewinded, questioning Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrat - who wins the seat in another district over the last spring selection.
Headed against another map, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which is overridden with a new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were reordered after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutional sided on the Republican party.
The new district of Pennsylvania 17 has led a major campaign between large party finances, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaig Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb's getting identified in Pennsylvania after a tipic victory in March's special selection that's public view for Congress 18 Pennsylvania Districts.
The course has been placed by the Republican Republican office for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Politics send the Democrat party a little bit superior.
A.S. served El Salvador for fighting Tiongkok, and then turned back.
diplomats confirm that the Republic of Dominika and Panama have confessed Beijing, by giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama to mitra drive the team of Trump Organization.
The State Department decided to retract the head of the American diplomatic mission of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the new despair that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department talker, shows in a first statement this month.
But punishment was considered only about El Salvador, who had received some $140 million of the United States in 2017, including the use of narcotical, development and economic support.
The recommendations, which covers the financial and visa limitings that are targeted, will hurt the Central Americans and rises the unemployment rates of unemployment and murder.
When the internal meeting occurred, the North Americans and Central Americans postponed high-level conferences focused on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year as a step forward to prevent the U.S.A.
But in the middle of September, government officials confirm that they want the conference to continue, to be effective to end the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to give a speech in that conference, right now is scheduled for mid October, as an impor signal that the government has done on that meeting, unattainted diplomats.
And the three American envoys are silent again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing counsel or a new sentence from Washington.
A White House talker for Mr. Bolton refused to comment about the details of the debate shown by the three American offices, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about this unspecified situation.
Their statements are reinforced by outside analyst and also talking about this unrealistic state.
Studi Acts
Another surprise story is Robert Mueller's special report on the possibility of the trial of Mr. Trump, which is now very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discuss his investigation is whether the Trump campaign is exclusive with Russia in attacking our general elections.
When Congress moved his hands, Mr. Trump will be asked to account of him, exactly when he was prepared to go again in front of the choosers, and may finally be the jury of his partners.
So it's still a lot to do, and I don't mean that the fall of Lord Trump will not be avoided - or his dignity in Europe.
There's a choice we better do on both Atlantic side that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to perform the quadeta against Hitler, if the West against him and supported Cekoslowakia in Munich.
We've failed, and we missed a chance in avoiding the next year of slaughter.
The start of history was focused along the point of such impulsion, and the fast democracy trophies or delay cannot be avoided.
Now the Americans are facing some point of this change.
What do we have to do if Trump fireed Vice President Rod Rosenstein, the man who was watching Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then it was reported that, last year, he suggested to keep the president shut up and think that he's not qualified for the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account isn't true.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I.'s just asked Brett Kavanaugh to be incomplete or fair - or if he was put to the Supreme Court, even if there was a strong accusation about sexual attack and an honest witness?
And besides that, are we going to give a voice in the middle of time for Congress that's going to ask for Trump's response?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we're gonna make it, because the lesson I've learned in Praha.
My mother was a Cekoslowakia who had beenported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who ever lived in my great embassy.
He survived, and then migrate to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the spinal candles on the table that he wrote.

Rangers took Rapid Vienna on the day of Thursdays, winning over Austria, following a good balance in Spain against Villarreal this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the European Grup Gga.
The knees Cedera makes the middle of Graham Dorrans bracelets can't be shown in this first season until 2-2 imbang against Villarreal, but he's sure the Rangers can use the result as a larger plough to the power.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," that's 31 years old player.

In the end, we could have done it but, according to the results, we might have been fair results.
In the first chapter, they may look better but in the second chapter, we rise and become a better team.
Traveling on Thursday, this night became another great European day.
We wish we could cut three points of me though it would be a hard fight because they had a good results in their final match, but, with the support of the suporter behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.

The federal officer suspects the death sentences that are rare to suspect the terror attack in NYC
A federal attorney in New York has been declared death sentences for Sayfullo Saipov, suspects in the terror attack in New York City, where eight people are killed -- those sentences are rare and have never been done in federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years, expected to do an attack by crashing a truck that was hired from Home Depot to travelers and bike drivers on the way along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to allow this death sentence, the lawyers must give evidence that Saipov " sengaja" beat the eight victims and "for sengaja" causes a serious body injury, according to the order to execute a death sentence, which was placed to the South York District.
According to the trial document, these two charges allow for death sentences.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury council seduced Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the launching of the crime, which usually used federal engineers in a state of organized crime, and violence and attempt to impaire vehicles.
According to the prosecution, the attack requires "a substantial planning and initial signature," as the description of the Saipov crime done with "ji, cruel, and rude."
It is revealed in the will statement, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damiagnco."
Five victims on that incident are the ancient Argentinan tourists.

In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant of two drugs, was finally sentenced to a lifetime prison sentence.
Eksecution the last death sentence in New York federal court in 1953, was sentenced to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg’s case, the married couple declared guilty of spionase conspiration for the Soviet Union during the Dingin War.
Rosenberg's couple are executed with electricity chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to the trial document, Saipov, the original Uzbekistan, does not show the regret of walking on the day and the moon after the attack.
When asked by the dwarf, he said that he felt happy about what he had done, unearthed the police.
Saipov expressed also to the authorities that the attack he was inspired by the ISIS video that was watched from his phone, as it was in charge.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be put in the hospital, the police.
He said that he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal defenses representing Saipov, expressing the "rejectively disappointed" against the decision of the prosecution.
"To follow us, the decision to execute death from accepting the guilty for the sentence of a life sentence without a guarantee of freedom will only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," see Patton.
Previously on, Saipov's defense team has begged the attorney not to execute death.
NIGEL FARAGE-it's the responsibility of the Brexit negotiation, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called to move the people's laskar today in a protesting action in Tory's conference.
The Ukip leader says that the politicians should have 'tilled his heat' Eurosceptics (the anti-Uni Europe) - because of one member of the parlement, Theresa May, suggesting to be in the negotiation with UE.
The conservative group, Peter Bone, told the street action in Birmingham that the British should go out right now if only Farage's reporting as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faced in the reconsciation of his position has been placed under the bottom by the companion of the Tories who was joined in the separate protest action of Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought his plan of Chequers to remain on his path even though in the middle of the Brexiteers, livingers and the European Union.
These countries emphasize that he'll be moved forward to the deal with Brussels, even if they get a bad reaction - and force Euros and Buruh must determine the choice between her proposals and 'kacau'.
Bone told the mass of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to think of Chequers.
It's the reason that Farage has to show a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If his responsibility remains, we're going out now," he says.
The Parlemen Wellingborough's expert is sending an extra round: "I'm ready to stand up support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
In fact, as far as it shows the concerns of the European Union: "We don't fight in the war of the world to be submissive.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone had noticed that the public opini was potentially changing a change since the vote in 2016: "Verifying that the thinking of the Britishs had changed and wanted a fixed condition, it was completely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jekyns who are also joined in the mass action, showing reporters: 'Just, I want to say: 'O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"The unmarkably not popular among the generals, while Oposisi won't choose it, because it's not popular with our party and the activists who are actually going down to the road and make us chosen in the first position.
Our request, remove Chequers and start listening to us.'
By a message that was directed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister defends their work when their promise is true."
Farage says that politician demonstrations must be intersect to get 'em heat' if they want to disobey the referenceendum of 2016.
“ This is the most precious trust between us - our people and our political party,' unattained.
'They're trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming them that 'we won't let you go to do that.'
He also added in a message to the crowd of analytic society: 'I want you to make our political party, which is getting ready to deny Brexit, also taste the heat.
‘ We are moving this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the birth of Britania Raya, self-destruction, and pride.'
In the meantime, the livingers were moving through the Birmingham before the action in the center of the city for two hours.
The activist line seems to spread Tories against Brexit after starting his line at the end of this weekend.
Recan in Buruh's line, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservative groups related to their party security issues when the party was opened.
‘ These people who say to us that they can control the TI and all technology for Canada, for the anti-destruction, in a free trade design of in Ireland,' immature.
‘ It was a joke.
There's no good Brexit at all.

"I think, if we really get something like he asks - a investigation that is bound by time, bound it-- we might bring some unity," says Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the comite was destroyed in the center of the board.

There will be a selection in the Senat, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit down.
Still not obvious if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 voices between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.

"I'd say this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he didn't match only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where it is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the High Court of D.C.
The negotiations added that he as a Democrat he was worried about the potential of Kavanaugh's breakdown against the Health Services or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered as a member of the conservative justice.

"For me it's not weird, what do you think?"
She continued, "I'm a very helped by a woman who was an executive in a place, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that means that she was angry and started crying, he would say to the person who was talking to him, "You might think I'm sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he keeps going.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were released as a way out of anger because they were basically misjudged.
One of my most powerful memory of the early job, at the office that was committed, one time I cried out with anger that I couldn't be able to find out, was my tengkuked by an older woman-- a cold manager that I've always been afraid of-- that I've been dragged me into the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're working."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a member of the congres of Colorado, was working with Gary Hart in the president's election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of the wedding on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the selection, Miss Schroeder, was very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for herself to call themselves no president.
"It's not a decision that he thought to be mature," he said to me and laughs 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the selection, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "Sharju and Seven Kurcaci."
Because it's too late in the campaign, he's left behind in the funding, and he swore he wouldn't follow a selection unless he managed to collect 2 million dollars.
It's a fight that leads to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave $10,000 to men only give him $250.
"Do they think I got a discon?" he wondered.
When he proclaimed that he won't launch a formal campaign, he's too ruled by emotions - thanks to those who support him, frustrasi with a system that makes the funding and to target the votes from the embassy, and anger of sexism - making it hard to talk.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacts to him.
"You're going to think that Kleenex is my college company.
I remember, thinking, what will they write in my grave?
"It's crying?"
How the U.S.-Tiongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade competition between the U.S. and Tiongkok was so tapped, and when the fight was still far away from the word of the weed, the inter-employment of the country might be useful for Beijing in long term, according to the experts.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S., shot the first warning this year by doing taxes to the Tiongkok key export including a surya, steel and anluminium panel.
A very significant estimate of being committed this week with a new basis that affects $200 billion dollars worth of value, effectively doing tax half of all things that enter into the U.S. through Tiongkok.
Beijing has returned every time, recently made a five to ten percent of American items worth $60 billion.
Tiongkok has been begging for the U.S. One, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in a close time.
Stealing Washington to stand back means following his will, but publicly surrendered to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of Tiongkok.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play the cards correctly, the U.S. competition pressure can support Tiongkok positively in a long period of time by reduceing the intersection between the two economy.
"Fakta that political decisions quickly by Washington or Beijing can make a condition that triggers economic movements in both countries are more dangerous than what was ever known," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who was focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a member of the United States.
Syria's ready for the return of the refugees, according to the Foreign Minister.

"Today the situation in the field is stable and safe for progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continued to rehabilitate the area that was destroyed by terrorists to return it back.
All conditions are present now because the return of volunteers to the country they should leave because of terrorism and a widespread economic decision that makes their lives daily and their dayday eyes as targets.
The United Nations calculated more than 5,5 million Syrians have been fighting from his country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others still live in the country need human help.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian regime will receive help to rebuild the destruction state.
But he stressed that they won't receive help or the conditional help of countries who support rebellion.
