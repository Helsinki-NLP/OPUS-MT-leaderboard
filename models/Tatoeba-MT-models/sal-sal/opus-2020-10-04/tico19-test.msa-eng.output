How long has this simptom been?
And all the chest pain needs to be treated this way especially at your age
And with fever
And that needs to check also is your kolesterol blood pressure.
And are you having a fever now?
And are you experiencing the heart disease now?
And besides that are you having trouble breathing
And can you tell me the other symptom that you've experienced with these symptoms?
And as high as your fever temperature
And I'm also rocky
And I'm having a little fluesma and a cough.
And my chest is really sick today
And is this the right time for your allergy fever?
and he gets the heart sick
And I think I'm a little fever.
And I want you to picture that chest hospital.
and they have a little fever.
And with your diabetes history
And you know my chest feels like it's gonna break.
And you know the coughs on me all the time
And you're having a heart pain.
And you say there's a pressure on your chest.
Someone in a family who has a heart condition of heart heart heart heart heart attacking colesterol high blood pressure
any symptom or another problem you noticed with muscle disease?
Is there anyone else sick like you at home with the same symptom like you?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Have you experienced any breaths?
Are you still having a chest pain?
Because it's the flu season.
But we shouldn't be overstepped to the heart's pain that comes from heart cardium.
But the more important problem now is this heart pain
but I'm having trouble breathing
But I know a lot of rocky people on me
But we need to take care of every heart pain seriously
But you breathe well now, right?
Because the pain of this chest I once forgot
Do you feel like someone press your chest?
Does it still feel like the breath?
Did they complain about the same disease as the symptom?
Do you have any other chronic problems like blood pressure or something like that?
Do you have any medical disease like diabetes?
Do you have any breaths with that chest’s pain?
Are you facing high blood pressure?
Have you been suffocating with that?
Do you know what the symptoms are going to be?
Do you see that image?
Drink water with a lot of today
But then I took a test for diabetes
But then he has a bit similar to me.
How high is your fever temperature?
How is your blood pressure?
If you continue to suffer hot fever
If you're having fever with a hundred or higher temperature
If you think your symptom or your problem will need further examination
I had a fever last night.
I'm having a little fever too
I had a fever last night.
I'm having a sick pain giving up here in the chest.
I'm having a little trouble breathing too
I'll send an image to you
I'm having a little pain today.
I'm just having a little headache and a little fever today
On my opinion is the flu.
On my opinion, it's a light flu.
Does it feel like a heavy man sitting on your chest?
It all started with a headache and with a fever at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest
It pushs like a heart pain.
It's in my chest
It's in the middle of my chest
It's in the middle of the chest
I feel sick in my chest
I'm so worried about the pain of this chest
I want you to tell me by describing this chest pain
Like high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like it's really in the middle of the chest
Now for the fever you can take Tachipirina candy
Now Mary's been how many days you've been having that symptom.
Now you're saying you're having a hearty pain.
I sometimes feel the pain of my chest
All right, do you experience any other symptoms along with this one but it's just sick?
Or someone sitting on your chest?
It's more like a fever and a cough of headaches and muscles.
Right in the middle of my chest
Show me to this image where you're feeling sick
Considering you having a fever.
So do you think some of those symptoms might be related to your pregnant state?
So did your children experience the same kind of symptom?
Tell me about your chest pain
The fever rises at night
The fever I had since two days ago
The fever began to rise last night.
This is the porter doctor in the emergency room triage center.
Can you tell me a little more about your chest's pain?
I feel sick on the front of my body in my chest
I have a strong pain in my chest
When I face pain in my chest
What pain do you feel in your chest?
When did the pain begin?
Where are you feeling pain in the chest?
NS
You feel like a breath in your chest.
You know I have diabetes and other others.
You said you had this chest pain.
Inn's quantity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which increases quickly in the European Union and the United Kingdom, January 1, to March 15, 2020.
Inn the quantity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) indicates the same trends in the European Union and the United Kingdom confirm that, even though it's at a different level depending on the country, the COVID-19 border is being in all nations.
According to the experience of Italian, countries, hospitals and rapid medical units have to increase their preparations to increase the number of patients with CVID-19 who will need health care, and especially rapi treatments.
On December 31, 2019, a pneumonia case clunt of an unknown etiology has been reported in Wuhan, the Hubei District, China.
On January 9, 2020, the United States Control and Prevention of the Chinese disease reported an agent of the cause of the coronavirus novel that is now called a coronavirus syndition syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease that came from SARS-CoV-2 has been named koronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Until now proves that about 80% individuals with CVID-19 have a light disease, e.g. the infection of a breathing channel with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients are cured.
In about 14% cases, COVID-19 develops a even worse disease that require treatment in hospitals while the rest of 6% cases have a critical disease that require rapid treatment.
The death of the patient in the hospital of COVD-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we examine the trends in the COVID-19 quantity incident in each European United States/EEEA and United Kingdom (UK) and compare these countries with the Hubei District, China.
We also compare the number of times during COVID-19's case in EU/EA and UK in Italy during January 31,–15 Mac 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK state
After China, COVID-19 has experienced the next geographic violation and dynamic pharmacy COVID-19 in the world at this time according to the dynamic of this country.
On March 11, 2020, director of the World Health Society announced COVID-19 as a pandemik.
In issue 5 Mac Eurosurvellance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported about the first COVID-19 case in Europe according to the definition of WHO's case.
In EU/EEA, the first three cases have been reported by France on January 24, 2020 of those who return from Wuhan, the Hubei District, China.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19's case was detected in all 30 countries of EU/EA and United Kingdom (UK), which between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,72777 were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 death from Italy alone.
Getting the number of quamulatives and the quans quans the COVD-19 case
In the European Health Center and Control of Disease Control (ECD), a COVID-19 case reported in every country worldwide, obtained only the official resources of the state’s Health Department, the national health authorities, the national health and the civil authorities, and the synonymous and the WHO, now at 8:00 in the morning.
This data is used to judge COVID-19's trend in EU/EA and UK, and compare that data with Italian.
As an active COVID-19’s penyebaran proxy, we've calculated an instrument of identification 14 days of CVID-19 case, so by taking about the path back to COVID-19, in every state of EU/EA and UK, during January 1 January–15 Mac 2020.
We also recommend the number of cases that are informed for each country at March 15, 2020 o'clock in the morning compared to the number of Italian cases for January 31-15 Mac 2020.
Trend COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK
The Trend in the quantified quantative incident 14 days of COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK countries are generally following the trends in the Hubei Region (China) (The Kingh 1).
For EU/EEA and UK worldwide, COVID-19’s quantional incidents began to rise about 21 February and then increase as significant as it was about February 28, 2020.
It's been significant by the fast increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries show similar development trends for CVID-19.
Kingh 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases, in the state of EU/EA and UKs of Italian cases of January 31-15 Mac 2020.
It stresses that, as far as 15 Mac at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and UK have reported the number of cases that are the same as Italian only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our decision shows that the number of COVID-19 cases that are currently up fast in EU/EA and UK.
The CVID-19 quantitive incidents suggest that the pandemik is contagious at the same speed in all nations.
Even though countries are at different stages, the variation in national health responses and the definitions of cases that may be different in countries and different protocols to choose patients that must be tested for the CVID-19 authentication, including the milklan test.
At the beginning of March 2020, a medical doctor in Italy describes a situation that saw 10% patients infected by COVID-19 requires rapid treatment and media sources reports that hospitals and rapid care units in the area have reached the maximum capacity.
The data about COVD-19 case entry in hospitals and/or rapi treatment units at this time are available at the EU/EA level for the 6% case and 1% alone, each (not shown data).
However, the data must be collected in a way that systematacts to support the current monitoring data on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study that was run in 2010-11 shows a large variation in a rapid caret and intercede in Europe, between 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds for each 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italian (12.5 rapid treatments and intervening care for each 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
A modeling scenario related to the medical nursing capacity, by estimates for each state of EU/EA and UK for the ministry of COVID-19 which is put to the hospital associated with > 90% risks over the rapid bed capacity, are available in the most related risk of the artifacts on COVID-19 by EC.
As far as this case has set up a certain collateral in EU/EA and UK country, and hospitals and rapid care units usually control the population of a clear area view, information about cases and a neat treatment bed should be provided for units of the area of statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current trend in other countries shows the COVID-19 is spreading quickly in EU/EA and UK.
The state, the hospital and the rapid treatment unit has to be prepared for the sARS-CoV-2 sARS and increase in the number of patients that are infected by CVD-19 who need health care, especially the treatments, just as they are in an area that are currently affected in Italy.
As pressed in the fastest risk of ECCC recently, fast approach, proactive and general is important to slow the SARS-CoV-2, with shifting from approach to reduction, because the rate of increase in case may not give enough results and the necessary hospitals to understand, accept their responses if they are not done earlier.
Prejudice riskry also lists a general medical care step to reduce the effects of pandemik.
There's a short window of opportunities that watches countries have the possibility to continue to improve their control efforts to slow SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, it may be that other EU/EA health care systems will face the increase of patients that need rapid treatments in the next day or week.
So it's a 2019 Coronavirus disease, because of the terrible artifact syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far has killed over 3,000 people and have spread more 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, cause calamity for mankind.
Just like the homologist virus, SARS-CoV, which led SARS in a thousand people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 also may spread from the bat and cause similar simptoms through the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a calibration of death and a lower number of deaths but it's easier to spread and affect more elderly people than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the number of quick - increasing issues about the new disease, this article is trying to provide a proper view of the time and a complete view of the advanced research subject.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and physics.
Many questions still need answers, but we hope that the review will help us to understand and eliminate the disease that threatened our life.
The spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unexpected memory and will not be forgotten by the Chinese people who are urged to sit in home during holiday season and weeks after that the result of a virus novel disease.
The virus was very homology to the coV (CoV) that led to a terrible respirator syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it is named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) 11 February 2020 and the disease related CoV Disease-19 (COD-19).
This Epidemik began in Wuhan, China and immediately spread throughout the country and about 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus has led over 80,000 COVID-19 cases, by over 40,000 patients are allowed to return and over 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "plicity of the public number 1" and potentially becoming stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 2000 papers have been published about CVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatments since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determines the virus sequence of being removed from some patients.
This comment is trying to simplify the development of the research in the new subject and the growth of the growth.
When appropriate, we would try to compare COVD-19 with SARS and another disease with CoV, Middle East breathing syndrome.
We'll also discuss this so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease and some more important questions.
His customary coV is considered to be a harmless patogen to humans, usually the source of 15% common fluesa 4.
However, in this century, we've found the human CoV two times as well as the high-truth, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the outbreak of each in China in 2003 and Arab Saudi in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with the worst morbiditi rates and deaths.
So COVD-19 is the third coV plague in human history recorded.
As shown in Kingh Kingh 1,1, the pneumonia collumonia is first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commissioner.
Seven days later the CoV sequence has been removed.
On January 15, 2020 the first death case from Wuhan has been reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic was contagious to the city, territory and neighboring countries.
On January 20, an infection between health - care personnel was reported, making it really possible for people to become irritated.
On January 23th, Wuhan city has been sentenced to lock up with all the public transportation services stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study reported that, out of 41 patients with a disahkand case, had only 21 direct contact with the Wuhan sea food market, considered the beginning of the jangchant from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO announced the disease as a global health emergency.
At this time, the disease was distributed throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide ( Kingh 2).2).
In view of situations developing quickly, the final scope and the disease disorder may not be certain.
On February 11, 2020, multiple studys of 8866 patients include 4,021 CIVD-19 patients confirming the latest ilustration of the episodes like this (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1qaqA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 extends the patients of all ages, but most of them are 30-65.
Nearly a half (47.7%) of a infected patient is over 50 years old, at least 20 years old, and only 14 people who are infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 extends more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 developed in the collateral most of it and about Hubei.
COVID-19 takes average 5 (2-9) days from starting to diagnosis.
The average interval is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Average of time from the beginning to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) day.
The number of reproductive (R0) bases are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and RO is a 2.23-4.82.
The number of people who were infected were increasing extremely before 23 Jan. 2020, corresponding to the big movement time before the Spring Festival in China.
The patient's death rate with a valid case is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the death rate is adjusted for all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main factors for COVID-19 are (last), old dn pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily for a large and secure virus that contains a single RNA deria thread.
The virus could be divided into four genuss, e.g., alpha, me, gama, and delta, between all the alphas and the I-CoV are known to spread human skills.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein tied on the cellular enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and the syndidydase four (DPP4) for each SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane joiner occurs.
The RNA gene is released into the Sitoslasma; after the genome, RNA genomes are companyed by the surface glikoprotein and proten nukleokapsid form vesikelsid that contain virion, which eventually associate with membranes the plasma to release the virus.
SARS-CoV-2's first genome has been reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 found it was a new type of me-CoV with more than 99.98.98% genetic identity in 10 samples taken from the origin of the disease, the Huan Sea Food market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 genetically is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transfer electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the most ecpis of human breathing channels.
ACE2 human being found was a receiver for SARS-CoV- 2 and SARS-CoV.
However, S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are tied to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which happens to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes poor infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new simple protein encoded by orf3b and protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus depths and have an IFNC expression; however, orf8 does not contain any domain or motive that works.
In February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the structure of cyro-EM of the human ACE2 is completely at 2,9 the resolution in complex with a B0AT1 acid transporter.
They found that that complex, which had an open and closed confirmation, was combined as the ACE-BOAT2 complexes can join two protein S, which gave evidence for the impatibility and the CoV.
B0AT1 can be the target of therapy for drug filters to hold the SARS-CoV-2.
Original host and middle
It's been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov are from the bat and transferred to humans by musang and camels.
Through SARS-CoV-2's filogenetic comparison with another CoV-2,war is considered as SARS-CoV-2's original host because the new virus is 96% similar to two CoV as SARS as SARS from the bat-SL-CoVX45 called bat-CoVX45 and the bat-CoVX21.
However, the intersection host that helps the virus to cross a spesis barrier to extend the human system to remain unknown, and the transmission path still has not yet been explained.
Ji, et al., suggest a snake as a virus driver from a bat to a human being involving homologic in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Hystri, China, suggested that the circle of the ants’s long-range mammals are always used in traditional Chinese medical medicine - are potential for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoV that found on tenggling and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% that spread throughout two genoms is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to define the concrete evidence is waiting (Rajah. (Fig.33).
The nature of SRAS-CoV-2 is still a lot of unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 45 days below 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar traits.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraunt and heat on 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, 75% ethanol, ethanol exaggerators that contain klorin, lorofomes, and other fats, but not clorofdinas, can deactivate the virus successfully.
The whole human population in general has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it's considered easy to be attacked by the virus novel.
At this time, no detailed research has been reported on the imunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the study before this about the other CoV, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. ( Kingh 4).
In general, after the virus crashes a host, the first virus is identified by the imunised system so the host through the pattern prescriptor (PRRs) including the recipetor like C (TLR), prescriptor such as NOD (NLR), and a recipe such as RIG-I (RRR).
Although the path is different, the virus results in the expression of the spread factors, the maturity of dendritical cells and interferony systhesis of I (IFNs) that limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the marofatosis of the virus.
However, the N SARS-CoV proteins can help the virus avoid the imun response.
Soon after that, the immunity responses were fighting the virus.
T Limfosit includes T CD4+ and CD8+ cells playing a vital role in defense.
The T CD4+ cell stimulates B cells to produce a particular virus antibodi and the T CD8+ cell continue to kill cells that are infected by the virus.
The assistant T cells make the procrement sitokin to help the defense cells.
However, CoV can prevent T cell function by causing T cell apoptosis.
The humoral efficient includes a sculpture like C3a and C5a and antibodi are also important in fighting virus infections.
For example, the antibodi that was banished from a patient who had healed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the extreme reaction of the system's immunity generates a large number of radicials in a body that can cause damage to other lungs and organs, and, in the worst cases, the failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2, based on early cluster, more likely to affect the Americans of gold with comorbiditis and pregnant women.
As for those who are exposed to a large number of viruss or that their imuncient function is affected, they have a higher chance to be infected than others.
The average set of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on research on 425 cases first in Wuhan.
However, study of 1,099 cases indicate that the time oframing is 3 days average and divided by 0 to 24 days.
One more recent study, as specified above, indicates that the time oframing is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demography 8,866 case.
It's important for the health authorities to adjust the time of the quarantine based on the most accurate implication period, and to prevent those who are infected but don't have a symptom from spreading a virus to others.
In common practice, people who are exposed to or infected by the virus often have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is quarantine time to continue to 24 days?
Demam is usually a major symptom and early to CVID-19, which can be accompanied without a symptom or other symptoms like a dry rock, stomptoms, breathing, muscle pain, headaches, rinorea, rinorea pain, chest pain, pain, properties, loyats and pudants.
Some patients face dispnea and/or hipoksemia a week after the initial illness begins.
In such a terrible case, the patient’s condition soon became up to the quant breathing syndrome, the rhythmicosis of metabolic and coagulopati.
The patient with fever and/or the celebrity of breathing and quant fevers, even without a pulmonarimity, has to be filtered for the virus for early diagnosis.
The demography study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of the symptom is 98% for fever, 76% for dry rocks, 55% to dispnea, and 3% for the properties of the germ; 8% patients need breathing help.
A similar discovery has been reported in two recent recent studies of the family’s clan and collaterals that have been affected by the spread of individual asimptomatic individuals.
In comparison, demography studies in 2012 show that the MERS-CoV patients also suffer fever (98%), dry rocks (47%), and dispnea (55%) as their primary simptom.
However, 80% of them needed breathing help, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher consecution by MER than COVD-19.
The properties (26%) and the puzzle sick (21%) are also seen in the MERS patient.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry rocks (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), properties (20-25%), and techlesk (13-25%) is a major simptom and breathing help is needed for about 14%-20% patients.
By February 14, the rate of death due to CVID-19 is 2% when the case is confirmed 66,576 throughout the world.
In comparison, the rate of death due to SARS until November 2002 is 10% of 8096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demography study in June 2012, death rate is 37% of 2,494 cases confirmed.
The early study reports that RARS-CoV-2 is a height of 6.47 with 95 percent of confidence (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV only corresponding between 2 to 4.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding the symptom, the death rate and the RO disease is shown in Table1.1.
The number above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread over MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less to bring death than two diseases.
So, it's much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemik than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of cycles often occurs in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicles, such as the intersection ship.
Because of traveling history or living in Wuhan or other affected area, it is common for patients to contact individuals who are infected or patients in the past two weeks before they start ill.
However, it has been reported that patients could bring a virus with no longer longer than two weeks and patients that have recovered from hospitals can bring a virus again, which sent a warning to increase the quarantine time.
The patient has a total number of white blood cells of phyfosition.
For example, limfopenia with white blood cells count <4×109/L including limfosit counts < 1×109/L, and the level of aminotrantphere which is raised and viremia has been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The enzyme level of heart and muscles and mioglobin has increased in the blood of some patients, and protein C-reactive and eritrosits have increased in the blood of most patients.
In the patient with a bad case, the D-dimer level, the product of fibrin degradation that is in blood, has increased, and the limfosit count has been significantly degraded.
The normality of the chest radiography was found in most COVD-19 patients and shown by the shadows of the calibrated or the surface of the ground glass in the lungs.
The patients usually have a psychic pneumonia, lungs and lungs are hard to breathe.
When ARDS comes up, an insecretized distribution, liquid gatherings and fibrosiss are quick to break gas exchanges badly.
Enable pneumositions of type-I and kind-ll reduces the level of surphact and increase the surface tension, at once reduce the lungs' ability to expand and increase the risk of lung failure.
Thus, a terrible radiography discovery often parallels with the worst of the disease.
In February 18, 2020, the first patological analysis of the CVID-19 showed pneumosition table, a limfosital membrane and interstitional syndibility syndibility cells in multiple lungs that die of the disease, consistently with the jangological patology of the virus and the DIDS and similar patology of SARS and MCA.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via transcryption-expection policies (RT-PCR) has been used as primary criteria for CIVD-19 diagnosis.
However, the result of a high negative rate, which may begin the epidemik, the clinical expression began to be used for diagnosis (that is no longer depending on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
So, the combination of disease, clinical infections, lab tests and radiology discoveries are important and imperial to make effective diagnosiss.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explains the protol use of SHERLOCK techniques based on CRISPR-CoV-2, which detect SARS-CoV-2 sintetic fragment at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of every microliter of input) using cel in less than an hour.
May the new technique be able to improve the sensitivity and skill in a significant way if it's confirmed in a clinical sample.
As a lack of experience with CoV novels, doctors can generally provide supportal treatments to COV 19 patients, while trying various therapys that have been used or recommended for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus diseases (Jadual2).2).
Theseapis include current treatments and potentially with drugs, imunosupres, steroids, plasma from patients that have been cured, Chinese medical and psychology support.
Moreover, plasma from patients who have been cured are also recommended to be used for treatment.
The pharmaceutical company raced to wake antibodi and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually strikes lungs at the beginning level and may also attack, at a lower level, another organ that produces ACE2, like the gastrous system and the waist fruit.
However, breathing failures and failures are a major threat to patients and are the main cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is important to comfort the symptom and save lives and including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen, invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the level of the disease.
A severe breathing symptom needs to be supported by extrakorporeum membranement information (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary photography technique used for kardium failure or breathing failure treatment.
In addition, electrolit balances, controls and secondary infections and surprises, and support of organ functions also need for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It's been known that a satokin storm came from the extreme reaction of the system's imuncient in SARS and MERS patients.
The satokin storm is a form of systemic recognition that includes the flowing of a series of sitokin including TNFImri, IL-1 “IL-1, IL-6, IFN istoholal, IFNO, IFNNG, IFN church, IFN church, and MCP-1.
This Sitokin generates imunciation cells to release a large number of free radicials that are the main source of ARDS and various organ failures.
The interview is important in the fun storm treatment, especially for a severe patient.
Kortikosteroid and tocilizumab, antibodi monocolonal anti-IL6, have been used to treat the sitokin storm.
Other imunotins treatment for a sitokin storm including the cell-T imunting response modules; IFN-1 partition, IL-1, and TNF; the JAK extension; blintumomab; signal scans 4; and HDAC intersectation of HDAC.
Steroid, as an imunosupresan, has been used widely in caring for SARS to reduce the damage damage.
However, steroids on high dos are not useful for the worst lung injured in the SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids on high dos can cause a bad side effects, especially osteonekrosis avaskular, impacting prognosisly.
But the low dos to simple cor Hayesteroid for a short period has been recommended to be used carefully for critical COVID-19 patients.
When this article is written, no effectiverapist has been verified.
However, the use of intravena with the redesivir, a nuclear analog, has been found to be effective with an American patient who was infected by CVID-19.
Redesivir was a novelized drug made by Gilead at first for treatment for the disease caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
And then the brakes ofvir also show the possibility of another single RNA virus of encode including the MERS and SARS virus.
According to this view, Gilead has given the mixed to China to run a couple of trials against individuals who are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very waiting for.
In addition, baricitinb, interferons, lopinavir/ritonavir, and laptopvirin has been recommended as potential therapy for patients with my accountt breathing symptom.
The properties, loya, pudding, heart damage and other bad effects can happen after therapies of the combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
In view of this treatment with another drug used to the patient has to be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients who have recovered and generation antibodi.
bloodshed from patients who had been paralyzed with a chronic illness, with similar diseases, and for the protection of a healthy individual from being infected with a long history.
True, a patient who has been healed usually has a relative antibodi level to the patogen in their blood.
Antibodi is an imunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lympsit B to fight patogen and other foreign objects and he knows the unique molecules in the patogens and then put them directly.
According to this, the plasma has been gathered from the blood of a bunch of patients who have healed from COVID-19 and have been introduced to 10 serious patients.
Their symptoms are much better in 24 hours, along with closures and less virus loads and saturation increased in blood.
However, confirmation and explanations are required to suggest that the method is for the use of large scales before the special therapy has not been built yet.
In addition, it has been obsolete, and some of the damage associated with the plasma has to consider.
For example, the antibodi can easily stimulate the imuncient response and cause the loss of the satokin syndrome, which is a potentially dangerous risk of life.
The antibodiity of blood is usually low and the request for plasma is great to take care of critical patients.
It's hard to wake up and produce special antibodis quickly to fight global epidemic.
So it's more important and practical to separate B's cells from the patients that have healed and identify genetic codes that decode the antibodie are effective or filtering the antibodies that are effective to the important virus proteins.
This way, we can improve antibodi production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, it's a lot of effect depends on the combinations of various components in different formulas according to the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most of the effective components remain unrecognitioned or blurred to make it difficult to extract and confirm such components or their optimal combinations.
At this time, because of the lack of special therapy and effective for CVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with a simple simptoms or for those who have recovered from a terrible level.
For example, Sapsul Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen was found effective for COVID-19 treatment.
The highest recovery rate in COVD-19 patient treatment has been seen in some areas in China that uses TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei region, which uses TCM in only 30% CIVIDE patients, has a low recovery rate (13%).
However, it is a fairly harsh comparison because of many other potential factors, such as the number and the growth of the patient, which is required to be included in that judgment.
In February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research to compare the western drug treatments (WM) only with the WM and TCM treatment combination.
They found that the time needed for the body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms and treatments in significant hospitals is short in the WM+TCM group of WMs only.
Most impressive, the rate for simptomatic state becomes worse (from light to bad) is lower for the WM+TCM group of WM is only (7.4%) group (7.2%) and the lower death rate in the WM+TCM group of the WM only group (8% instead of 39%).
However, so, the TCM and safety is still waiting for a more secure trial at the larger stage and in more centers.
It must also be interesting to describe the act mechanism and explain an effective component in the TCM or the combination of the treatment if it can.
Those who were suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are experienced a great fear of a very simple disease and could cause death, while they also suffer anxiety and anger.
In addition to that, velocate such a fever, hypothesia, and coughs and insomnia treatments such as corsteroids can bring to more anxiety and higher mental dialects.
At the beginning of the SARS plague, various morbiditi psychiatric morbiditis including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychormotor test, psychotic symtomtom, dealium, and even suicide reported.
A mandatory contact and quadatory, as part of public health response to CVD-19's COVID, can cause people to feel more troubled and guilty about jangcord effects, quantin and stigma on their family and friends.
COVID 19 was required of mental - health care that it required that the U.S.A., people who accepted it, and those associated with them as well as the public.
The psychology support must include multiple mental health forces, clear communications are now fixed and precise about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and plans and use devices and professional electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective Vaksin is important to interfere with the transfer chain of animals and humans who are infected to exposed hosts and usually equip the body treatments in the epidemik control that are caused by the virus to appear.
The attempt has been performed by waking vactions based on S proteins to generate long-term antibodi and effective and/or saturation that protects from SARS-CoV.
The Vaksin who's now weakened has been tested in an animal model for SARS.
However, the sense of in vivo is the candidate of this vaccine in an old person and a dangerous challenge model and protection of their virus infection need to be determined before the clinical study starts.
This may have been because SARS was over 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
By contrast, the specradic and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread into other areas because of the ongoing bionotic resources in the Roman area.
Completion strategy has been built for MERS using unactive viruss, DNA navigator, virus vectors, particles, particles such as viruss and sub-pocombinan proteins and some of them have been tested in an animal model.
Safe and effective vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 for unimumed individuals is a necessary and important task to control the current episode.
However, it is difficult to overcome difficulties because of a long time period of time (purata 18 months) is required for the development of vaccines and the variation of CoV dynamics.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just showed a full clinical path in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be healed slowly without being infected again.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbiditi rates and high deaths in patients with severe cases.
So building a professional model for the illness is vital for health care agency to put their services first in a region where there is no resources.
According to the study of the clinicals that are reported so far, the following factors may affect or associate with the CVID-19 patient prognosis (Jadual33):
Umur: Umur is the most important factor for the SARS prognosis, which is also true for CVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurred at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of the patient is over 50 years old in research on 8,866 cases specified above.
A patient who needs more rapid treatments may have a comorbiditi and a hidden and much more than those who do not need it (at the age of the median 66 over 51 years), suggested age as a prognosis factor for the CVID-19 patient’s patient’s decision.
Jantina: SARS-CoV-2 has ranged more men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as specified above.
Commorbidi and compilation: A patient with COVD-19 who needs a rapid treatment more likely to be suffered by a quant cardium and aritmic injury.
The kardium problem is also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be bound to the positive colangiosite ACE2, which may bring to the disfunction of heart in COVD-19 patient.
Having observed that the secret age and disease are related to each other and can interfere with each other.
The abnormal lab study level: the C-reactive protein level (CRP) in blood indicates a cubicity or asu injury and has been recommended as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to final therapy and recovery.
Hubung CRP's stage of clutches and prognosis CVID-19 has also been recommended.
In addition, the laktat dehidrogenase (LDH), apart of aminotransferase (AST), aminine aminotrantferase (ALT), and kreatina kinase (CK) can also help predict decisions.
This monstrous vegetable in many organs, especially heart and heart, and being released when asu damage.
So it's a traditional marker for a heart function or heart.
The main clinical symptom: the hypography of the chest and the progress of the clinical race by time has to be considered together with other issues to predict the due and the CVID-19.
The use of steroid: As mentioned above, steroid is an imunotinmination used as a morale therapy for clerical disease to reduce the damage damage.
The view of the high dos of kor whensteroids have been used widely in severe SARS patients, many patients suffer from an avaskular osteonekrosis with a lifetime and a bad life quality.
So if necessary, steroid must be used to the lower dos and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mentional pressure: As mentioned above, during the 19 COVID, many patients have suffered from severe pressure because they have often experienced severe quarantine period and extremity and witnessed death of close family members and patient friends.
It's important to provide psychology and long - term support to help the patient recover from pressure and return to normal life.
According to the demography study, COVID-19 appears to have different features of epidemiology than SARS.
In addition to multiple in lower breathing salurs, SARS-CoV-2 can be doubled with efficient in the top breathing salatoes and cause a light simptom or no symptom in the early jangtom, equal to the other CoV which causes common cells.
So the patients who are infected at the beginning or the time of the discretion can produce a large number of viruss in their day - to - day activities, causing it to be very difficult to control epidemik.
However, SARS-CoV's expression is considered to be happening during a severe patient, while most logics don't occur at the beginning.
So the COVID-19 plague is much worse and hard to be controlled than the SARS plague.
It's a great effort on the road in China including a cemental command in Wuhan and the city around it and the quarantine continues almost the population with the hope of breaking SARS-CoV-2.
Although this may result in economic and other sectors in general, the number of new patients decreased, marking epidemik slowness.
The most optimistic thing is that the plague is going to end at the end of Mac and the lower phase will run for 3-4 months.
However, some experts do not become overly optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al, estimate that COVID-19, which seems much easier than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., make models to predict the episode and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can extend two per third populations of the world.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both turbinats and cramped patients who had healed and left hospitals two weeks earlier, which marked that a virus that was recently known that could be a recured episod like influenza.
However, a solid signal in China has been based on the number of new cases that are progressing, showing that they may have responded well - founded in some ways.
The Ebola at first was predicted would cause a million cases with half a million deaths.
Yet, with quarantine and security, the disease finally managed.
So, like SARS-CoV, maybe SARS-CoV-2's infections are weaker and finally end up or be a less patogen that exists with humans.
The comparison between the epidemik CVID-19 and SARS and MERS is available below (Rajah55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to shake through a rock or skick, and can also infection through direct contact with the device that has been contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in shit, which led to a new possibility of remarking from unclean to mouth.
Recently on 138 cases report that 41% cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health officers.
So careful measures should be used to protect people, especially health officers, social workers, family members, friends, and even people on the other side of the road connected to patients or infected people.
The first line that can be used to reduce the risk of ourjang is with a face mask; both use the flowing mask and N95 mask (siri # 1860) help control virus penyebaran.
A surgical mask prevents cairant from drawing from individuals who are likely to be infected by traffic or attached to the surface of the material, which can spread to others.
However, only the N95 type mask (siri #1860s) that can protect from the virion dense of the 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion that can cross N95 type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost equal to SARS-CoV of the size where both are less than 85 nm.
Since the virus particles can go through five surgery masks that are used together, the health officers that have contact directly with the patient need to wear N95 masks (siri #1860s) not the body face mask.
In addition to the face mask, health officers need to use self - protection equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also extend individuals through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 even though he has wearing N95's face masks; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes that have been affected.
In a similar manner, health personnel often need to use transluent face armor when confronted with patients.
To the public in areas that are dangerous or dangerous, it is recommended that all inhabitants of the population wash their hands with the soap of a quantches often stay at home and cut off contact with individuals who are likely infected.
The three - foot distances are considered an appropriate distance to distance themselves from the patient.
These steps are a effective method in lowering the risk of infections instead of preventing the cellularity.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 gives warning to China as the SARS plague hit in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020 Director of the Control Control Center and Prevention of Wuhan’s disease is trying to reduce its people’s anxiety by saying that this novel virus has a low infection rate and a limited reproduce to humans and the evacuation and the damage of disease is not a problem.
The message was successful to ease public anxiety, especially when the entire country was making the Lunch Festival, and it could not be held to block the plague at the minimum scale of Wuhan.
The medical control agent in China can learn from this and make further adjustments in the future.
For example, the syndicate (1) is more careful in making announcements to the public view every detail that affects people’s attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and renovative information received from the clinics than waiting for a formal report of doctors or officers; (3) more strict in blocking a public plague; and (4) it is more frequent training for public disease and fixing the social reactions.
COVD-19's statement is due to the SARS-CoV-2 novel virus that starts at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world when this writing was made.
Since this virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptom is also similar to SARS, the CARS statement of CIV-19 has created the SARS plague has repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in blocking epidemik and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects the individual of young people as well as more to a man than a woman, abjection and death rate is also higher to parents than to buy.
SARS has higher death rate than CVID-19 (10.91% than 1.44%).
CVID-19 patients can spread a virus without any symptoms while SARS patients spread a virus in pain, which caused trouble in the CVID-19's collision of SARS.
This explains the source of SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wide than SARS-CoV.
RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVD-19 patients.
However, the healing patients can be found on positive viruss.
This meeting is indirectly increasing the risk of the cellular risk.
According to progress in research to COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be held, some of them:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homologys were found on SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs like SARS batwar, we can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also came from the bat.
What animal is the species of the intersect that spread the virus from the houser, for example ofwar, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to #1 and 2, we can't decide a simple expression, and the plague can repeat at any time.
Although the molecular model test and biochemy has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how is the virus actually entering the air channel cell and the next result of the change of patological?
Does the virus tie ACE2 expression cells on other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we can't reach the quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this episode last?
How does this virus develop genetically through the harmony between humans?
Is it going to be a pandemik all over the world, erased like SARS or rebooting like a fluesma?
It's important but it takes time to find answers to questions above and many other questions.
However, no matter what expenses we're being approved, we have no other choice but to stop this epidemik as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The origin of the zoonotic human coronavirus.
Mutation and adapt have motivated evolution with coV (coV) and his main host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) have been known to cause a mild disease, such as fluesma.
A bad quantal Sydrome and the Middle East Sydrome has changed the view and reveal how HCoV is terrible and could threaten life.
The SARS-CoV-2 community in China at the end of 2019 has attracted attention to CoV and surprised us with the simple credentials but less patogenics than SARS-CoV.
The HCoV's disease is the zoonosis and understanding of the origin of HCoV's environmental environmental faculties can help us.
Most of HCoV comes from the innovative bats.
The interservoir host of some HCoV is also known.
Identifying the animal host has continued to deal with human illnesses.
The presentation about CoV's host interactions in animals allows the importance of understanding of the patogenesis CoV in human beings.
In this study, we're drawing the whole description of knowledge there's about seven HCoV, focused on his history of his discovery and the origin of the zoonotic and transmission between species.
Which is important, we compare and distinguish the differences of HCoV from virus evolution and rejoining genoms.
The epidemik disease when COVID-19 was addressed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange and replications against virus evolution to the disapproval of disease.
Koronavirus (CoV) is from Coronaviridae's family, made up of a single virus group of RNA threads, positive, consecutive.
This genome length is between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the biggest genome among RNA viruss and is given the name "CoV" because the form of his morfology looks like a crown under the electron microscope.
In the structure, CoV has no congreent genome that shares the same instrument.
It is estimated that two thirds of these genoms have two open - frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) large and large, which is later translated to pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein repse.
Poliprotein later processed to produce 16 non-restructed proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The genome is composed of ORFs for structured proteins, including pepic (S), cover (E), membrane (M) and nleoprotein (N).
Some special protein accessory proteins are recorded by CoV.
Based on the difference of protein sequences, CoV is identified to four generas (alfa-CoV, I-CoV, gama-CoV and delta-CoV), where I-Cov is composed of most HCoV and divided into four sequences (A, B, C, C and D).
The filogenetic evidence indicates that the bat and the rats are acting as a source of gene to most alpha-CoV and My-CoV, while the bird is the main reservoir of gama-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, the CoV has been passing through the challenge of the species and some of them have appeared as an important patogen of humans.
Until now, 7 human coronavirus is known.
Among them is HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 is an alpha-CoV.
The five other coV-coV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, bad dot breathing syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East breathing syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 have a simple spimptom, such as a fluesma and/or a root-t.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are known to be very patogenic, causing a severe renovator of the patient that has a high probability to get the respirator respirator.
The first HCoV-229E Strain, B mulberry, has been separated from the patient's nose discaj who had a fluestic in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was collected through a vast study on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of them have caused the self-control.
This contract has been received widely that HCoV's infection is in danger until the SARS plague appears.
The SARS plague occurred in 2003 and was one of the worst destructions in history, infected more than 2,000 people with more rough death rates than 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East synthematical syndrome (MERS) has caused an ongoing epidemik in the Arab Semena visited by the spread of sporadics throughout the world.
Novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), who later was named SARS-CoV-2, is an agent of the current coronavirus plague of 2010 (COVD-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and has spread over 91,000 individuals to March 2020.
Warning has been given and the world needs to be willing to face the SARS-CoV-2 pandic.
All seven HCoV has the origin of the zoonotic from the bat, rats and domestic animals.
There are various evidences that support evolutional origins all of HCovs from the bat, where the virus is easy to adapt and not passive but shows a great geneticity.
Epidemik CVID-2019 has brought medical, scientific, social and moral to China and the whole world.
HCoV's original-tooV's original encoding gives a frame of historical understanding so, alarmic power and partition factor for species jumping.
This may also drive and ease the search of a reservoir host, interservoir, intersect and reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2, with an important application in the gracey in the future.
In this rehere, we're suggesting the whole image of the zoonotic origins, transmisi between species and patogenesis of HCoV.
Especially, we're referring to and discussed the common theme where virion HCoV is not patogenic in reservoirs to be hosted but to be patogenic after intersecsising to a new host.
We're reexaminating HCoV's evolutionary direction where the increase of resemblancing is often showing up with a patogenic reduction.
The results from the SARS-CoV-2 plague which are continued to be discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E decipher from a patient's nose discaj who had a fluesma, a different CoV has been separated in many infected animals, including belanded chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In a few decades ago, seven HCoV has been identified.
A simple summary of the HCoV discovery history in a chronic rule (Jadual 1) can give information and lessons.
The first HCoV-229E stream has been separated from the patient’s breathing channel that has been infected with a culpriting channel on the top of the breathing channel in 1966, and the next one has been adjusted to grow in the line of WI-33 lung cell.
The infected patient with HCoV-229E is seen with a flufeatic symptom, including headaches, disins, and teasy pain, with fevers and rocks seen in 10~20% cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 has been banished from the organ cultures and the next section of the serial in the mice brain.
The HCoV-OC43 clinical picture looks like a calibrated by HCoV-229E, which is generally unrecognizable from the infection with other breathing channel patogens such as the virus influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread throughout the world and tend to spread more in the winter in the simple midweight land.
Normally, these two-thirds of this virus are less than a week, followed by disease for about two weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, a healthy individual who is infected by HCoV-229E has a light of common fluess.
Only a few patients have been compromised show a severe bottom breathing infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia atipical", is a pandmik which is due to the first HCoV was recorded well in human history and his etiology agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS could be detected back to the end of 2002 in the Guangdong Region in China.
Epidemik SARS caused 8,096 cases reported to 774 death, spread throughout many countries and continents.
In addition to super evangelizers, it's estimated that every case can cause about two secondary cases, with the term between 4 to 7 days and the violation of the virus on the 10th day of illness.
The patient who was infected SARS-CoV at first showed the mialgia, headaches, feveres, cold and cold, followed by dispnea, rockks and respiratory respirators.
Limphofenia, a live-up heart function test and creatina cinase growing is SARS's normal abnormality.
Infusion of alveolars, the development of epitelium cells and the increase of the macrofaj also noted in the SARS patients.
About 20-30% patients later need rapid treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the infections on the bottom breathing cycle, several organs include gastrous scalurs, hearts and waists can also be infected in this terrible case, usually accompanied with a satokin storm, which can cause death especially in the obligatory patients.
The first virus was banished from the lung biopsy open a brother to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Hystri.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been run for HCoV investigations.
HCoV-NL63 was banished from a 7-year-old kid from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
At first the virus was found spread among children, gold people and patients have been compromised with breathing disease.
Koriza's presence, conjunktivitis, fever and bronkiolitis are normal in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free study tells us about the same virus detection of a nasciment of a eight-year-old boy who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although known in the Dutch, the virus actually spread throughout the world.
It's estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the root of about 4.7% normal respiratory disease and when the peaks cause the disease is in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive escapes, as well as corrupt.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who had been put to the hospital with pneumonia and bronkiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronkiolitis who are infected in community, HCoV-HKU1 also reported being associated with the account of myth acid.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found all over the world, causing a light respiratory disease.
All four HCoV infected in this community has been adapted to human and generally less likely to mutation and cause a very tragic disease, even if an accident has been happening for an unknown reason because there's a rare case about a more dangerous HCoV-NL63 sub-N63, which recently reported has caused a severe breathing jangage under China.
In general, when this HCoV gets the ability to spread with efficient and to remain permanently in the human body, this virus also becomes less harm or malt.
The first MERS-CoV was banished in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had a quant pneumonia and a pinggang failure in the Arab Saudi.
Although most cases have been confirmed by the lab from Central East, the case was imported with a secondary expression to a contact has been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases that were confirmed.
The clinical Manifestation for MERS is compiling SARS, defined by the progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have been suffering from a quart belt failure, which is unique to MERS between the disease caused by HCoV.
More than 30% patients show gastrous simptoms, like sifatts and puddings.
By February 14, 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed in labs have been reported with the death of a tall of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruss that hit humans.
When the middle of December 2019th, the pneumonia patient collaterally known to the SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Wuhan, the area of Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization declares the death of an underwear sARS-CoV-2 clarity of the International Health Committee and also named CIVD-19.
As far as 3 Mac 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported all over the world, with death of a rough three.
Ketara, the death of a case in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the death of the case outside that area is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes terrible breathing infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, to appear as fever, cospnea and dispnea.
The properties are also happening to some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the worst symptoms and can rise quickly to be an insect syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because the high nucleotida sequence of nucleotida so many 82%s, the virus is grouped to be different to the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be less patogenic but more easily contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
A automated aspiration subject that infected SARS-CoV-2 has been reported and may contribute to a simple expression throughout the world.
Crying and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCoV that would reveal the equation and a very interesting difference.
First of all, the time of the reconing and the time has become HCoV's disease was very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follow the other six HCoV trend.
Second, the Cimptom COVD-19 is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVV found from the community (cth. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
From one triangle, the SARS-CoV-2 infections show the more commonly seen feature by HCoV is found from the community, including unspecified simptom presence, light or no symptom.
In another way, a little subset of COVD-19's case can also be seen as in SARS-CoV's infection case, although it's a little bit low.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 is also showing an interesting pattern for both HCoVs found from community and SARS-CoV.
From one triangle, the SARS-CoV-2 may be at least as high as HCoV is found from the community.
In other terms, it's hard to confirm that the SARS-CoV-2-coVity is reduced after human beings like in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV case.
Finally, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a shit sample.
Whether the evacuation of shit to the mouth for SARS-CoV-2 play a vital role like in SARS-CoV case at least under certain circumstances waiting through research in the future.
It's interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 might fall by the season like in HCoV's case that's infected in community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including the contagiousness, efficientness and ongoing preaching after man will affect the end of the COVD-19 plague.
All four of the HCoV infected in the community cause light symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoV four.
In other words, both of them may be saved from the HCoV finale.
HCoV, who has caused serious illness in humans and humans, who had been diagnosed with disfellowshipped HCoV.
To allow this to happen, HCoV needs multiple in human beings to make enough stages to allow the group of mutation to adapt that against host partition factors.
So, longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague holds and more people infected, more likely the chance for the virus is fully adaptable to human beings.
If the virus is adapted properly, the cellular in humans will be difficult to block with quarantine or other jangtine control step.
For many years, four CoVs were infected in community leaving in human populations, causing common fluess in the shared subject.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoirs.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well andular in human beings.
The virus had to remain and reproduce in his petnotic reservoir and find a chance to spread to a simple human target, perhaps through one or more intersects and reproduce.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same feature as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the fourth-four HCoV infected in community.
It's very easy to spread like HCoV that's infected in community, at least at this time.
However, the virus is more passive than HCoV who is infected in community and is less passive than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time that will determine whether the virus will adapt fully to human beings and spread among humans without a transfer or an internship host.
Before we discuss the origins of animals that become the source of HCoV, it's better to discuss the definitions and aspects of evolutionary hosts, again, reservoirs, intersections and HCoV.
A animal acts as a evolutionary host for HCoV if he has a very close heir that shares high homology at the level of the nucleotida sequence.
The virus of the offspring is usually adaptable and not passively in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host keeps HCoV ongoing and for long-term.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally, and it's a natural host for the HCoV or the virion.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV was introduced to a host before or about his identity to humans, the virus was not properly adapted to a new host and usually a phigenic.
This host can act as a source of zoonotics for human infections and play a role as a reproduce host by allowing the virus to double and then spreading the virus to be man to strengthen the human infection scale.
HCoV could have a dead road infection if it can't maintain it in the intersect host.
Instead, HCoV can be adapted to the intersection host and also create a long-term term.
In this case, the host became a reservoir host.
The epidemiology data exposed directly that the SARS index has a history of contact with an animal hunt.
The next termroprevalens claim that animal sales have an anti-SARS-CoV IgG higher than the public.
The lamri Musang (Paguma larvata) and the larvata dog at the first-a-life market must have been identified to bring a virus like SARS-CoV almost similar to SARS-CoV.
It's not directly supported by the fact that no SARS was reported again after killing all musangs in the market.
However, it has been reported that the musang lamri from the woods or farms without exposure to the market of animals in most of the lives of SARS-CoV, suggested that lamri musar lamri might only be a host to strengthen the intersect but not reservoirs to be SARS-CoV.
At most obvious, considering 80% different animals in the market in Hystri have anti-SARS-CoV antibodi, that many species of small mammals may become a host to the SARS-CoV can't be ignored.
All of this looks like a dead street host for SARS-CoV.
The next search for the animal hoses is for SARS-CoV to expose the interrelated CoV HKU3, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-RatCoV HKU3) the RKU3 bat is related to SARS, which exists in the Chinese ladar.
This is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodi and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
This bat and the other CoV bat shares 88-92 homology nucleotida sequence with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided a basic basis for a new concept that the rose host produces a human patogen.
Some CoV like SARS (SL-CoVs) is also known to be identified from the bat, but none but one named WIV1 could be separated as a living virus.
Human angiotensioner 2 (ACE2) is known as a receiver for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from the immune samples shown using bats, musangs and ACE2 humans as recipients for cell entries.
It's interesting that the SARS patients that are now recovering are able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related generation for SARS-CoV in the bat, sharing 95% namology of nucleotida sequence.
Although there's a high homology between these two viruss, in general believe that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and awar isn't a live SARS-CoV host.
The filogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU4 batwar CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and conwar MERS-CoV using the same host recipeor, orptidated 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA polymerase sequence depends on RNA of MERS-CoV is a filogeneticly close to the virus in the I-CoVwar known of Europe and Africa.
Until now, there's no MERS-CoV living can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the most close family of CoV-HKU25 shares only 87% mallology nucleotida sequence.
So, the bat may not be a live host to MERS-CoV.
Instead, studies in the Middle East indicate that arab has a positive effect to the special antibodi MERS-CoV, just like a camel in the Middle East from many African countries.
The MERS-CoV life similar to the virus that was found in humans has been isolated through the arab camel's nasab, then it indicates that camels work as a host of MERS-CoV-coV.
Also, it needs to be noted that the commonly simple symptom but a large bulletan of the virus has been observed in the camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Especially, the camels that are infected releases the viruss not only through breathing paths but also through the unclean path, which is also a path for the virus released from the bat.
However, the question remains since many cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the symptom began, it's likely to be associated with the human penyebaran path to mankind or the unknown penyebaran path which involves unknown species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% homolog with CoV RaTG13war separated from Rhinolophus affinis.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the conspiration of between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent's relationship.
It could be said, the roses may not be the nearest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 but the most similar CoVwar was found in the future.
Perhaps, the host of the intervening animal to SARS-CoV-2 is from a wild species sold and killed in the Borong Food Sea of Huanan, which is associated with many early COVD-19, showing the possibility of a animal penyebaran event to humans.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic order have suggested that a small mammal-like group known as javanica (Manis javanica) can also save me-CoV descendants related to SARS-CoV-2.
Genom CoV is sharing 85-92 homology nucleotida with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they're both connected to RaTG13 with about 90% identity on the nucleotida sequence.
They're gathered in two sub-lines of viruss like SARS-CoV-2 in pilogenetic tree, one of them share a prescriptor binding domain similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of an amino acid identity.
In a real difference, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is more distinct, even though having a higher jimology sequence of homology.
A previous study of the infected tenggling also reported a virus contig of lung samples, which later found the same connection to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses a group method and select manual milk to generate a part of a partial genome that includes about 86.3% of a full virus genome.
We can't explain the possibility that the circle is one of the internship hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, at this time, there is no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 is going to continue from tenings of conspiration between SARS-CoV-2 and I-CoV are related to SARS-COV-2 tenggling.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than SARS-CoV-2 and I-CoV are related to SARS-COV-2 tenggling.
SARS-CoV-2 evolution path in bats, circles and other mammals still need to be set.
As the highest homology order has been found in RBD between SARS-COV-2 and tenggiling, I-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 that shares the highest sequence of genes.
A strong speculation states that high-level equation between RBD of my-CoV-CoV-2 is related to SARS-coViling and SARS-CoV-2 is packed by evolution is divided between choice.
A favor of resemblances between me-CoV-CoV-coV-2 tenggling and RaTG13 in third wild species.
As the power of evolutionary drives, recommended happen widely in my me-CoV.
The study is still done about the origins of the Motornotic directly SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to a very popular HCoVoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been reviewed.
The filogenetic evidence indicates both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have come from CoVwar, while virion HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 has been found in mouse.
It has been reported that the CoVwar was called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the three North Americans have shown a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E is genetically related to the other coV of thewar, called Yusufsideros/GhanaKwam/198, which has been detected in Ghana, while the camelid has also been suspected as the intercede host.
To be clear, the current knowledge of animal origins for HCoV known in Kingh 1 and Table 2.
The filogenetic analysis has given evidence for HCoV'sular events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 hits species to extend humans from the domestic livestock about 1890, the celebrities of breathing have been recorded.
HCoV-229E computing history between species is equal.
But the alpha-CoVwar relative to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is an alpaka alpha-CoV.
Some of the evidences support the cellulars of the immune to humans directly.
First, man but not an alpaka may have contact with a bat in a shared ecological ethology.
In contrast, it is possible for humans to have contacts with an alpaka.
Secondly, the alpha-CoVwar is related to HCoV-229E is a variety and not a patogenic on the bat, while the alpha-CoV alpaka is leading breathing disease in the skin.
Finally, alpaka alpha-CoV was not found on wild animals.
Well, it's probably not possible that alpaka gets an alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E of mankind.
In reality, the immune is the direct source of human patogenic virus including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
So it's not too dramatic that we can move HCoV-229E directly to humans.
As an alternative, even though alpha-CoV Kelawar became the bottom of the HCoV-229E gene, alpaka and arab camel may be a host that moved the virus to humans, exactly like in MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is the best example to the expression between the species of arab to arab camel and arab camel for mankind.
MERS-CoV's origin of knownwars at the beginning of introduction and has been introduced with the next discovery.
Clearly that the bat provides the bottom of the virus species for genetic fragment exchange between species and space between species.
A long, coloni was packed, a social interaction that was close, and a strong flying ability is all the circumstances that encourage the rose to become the ideal virus.
Besides, MERS-CoV has been introduced to an arab camel for freed-dekad.
It adapts well to these camels that have changed from intersection host to a stable and reservoir host.
MERS-CoV caused a very light disease and kept a low mutation rate relatively in this animal.
His sporadic logics to humans are innocent and humans remain as the last host to MERS-CoV because the impostor can't be preserved.
It's different if there's an SARS-CoV-coV function in the field of MERS-coV, if there's, in the SARS-CoV-2ular is different.
Especially, I-CoV tenggiling is very patogenic in the circle.
They're probably the last host for me-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2, the same as a musang in the SARS-CoV case.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2's ventilation between species of animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in research in the future.
First, the rose can be a reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 related viruss that are almost equal to SARS-CoV-2.
People may share ecology niche with a bat through a bowl or a stone mining.
Second, the circle can be one of the new internsor hosts known by SARS-CoV-2 related viruss.
People are infected by a virus through a sacrifice and eat an animal hunt.
Maybe a lot of mammals including domestic animals are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
One review of domestic animals and wild animals for antibodi is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, combined and adaptable SARS-CoV-2 may have happened in third species that have contact with both bats and tengglings.
The original animal search of SARS-CoV-2 still continues.
In addition to different type of host animals, three main factors on virus parts are also important in simplifying CoV over the species's obstacles.
First of all, relative their mutation rates are high in RNA's mark.
In addition to a single RNA stort virus, the coV mutation rate that can be considered as "only" to the average exchange rate is ~10-4 exchange a year every two bases, depending on CoV's Fasa adapt to novel host.
CoV has an exoribonukleas of pruf reading, his eraser caused a very high and weakness or may also lack of life’s resources.
Interesting, the nucleotida Redesivir's nuclear analog was known to press CoV's exoribonuklease through this exoribonuklease and the RNA’s polymerase that depends on RNA.
Redesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical tests.
Even so, CoV mutation rate is about a million times higher than the host.
Besides, the mutation rate is always high when CoV is not adapting well with the host.
From SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, mutation rates on SARS-CoV-2 seem low, suggesting a higher adaption to humans.
Maybe he's already adapted to another host near human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it's also used to MERS-CoV, which adapts well with arab camel.
Theoretically, it's impossible that genetic shifts will make vaccines and vitamins against SARS-CoV-2 doesn't work in a short period.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses extra density in genome changes for mutation and reboots, and then increases evolutional probability together between species, which are useful for the appearance of CoV novels when the conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a unique open sequence and protein function encoded toward the end of 3' genom.
Third, CoV changes randomly and often during RNA marking through unique "tiru-select" mechanism.
In a host that works as a former mixer, thread exchange often occurs during the RNA CoV transcryption.
RNA subgenom and full of homologists can be rejoined to produce new CoV.
The filogenetic evidence of rejoining so has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals like SL-CoVwarwar and CoV-HKUU9.
The virus host interaction is related to the expression.
In addition to three virus factors that are specified above, interactive viruss with host recipetors are another factor that affects the cellular between species.
Here, rejoining SARS-CoV is taken as an example of special, which also indicates a positive option during theular event between species.
According to comparison analysis between human pencils and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV expected to be on a fast adaptable in a different host, especially with mutation in RBD on protein S.
Generally, RBD on S proteins on CoV interacted with cells and was chosen strong by host antibodial responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is inside a three-18 amino acid to 510 on the S1 piece, which binds to ACE2 and prescriptors together for the virus entry.
RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify a recipeor ACE2 of various animals, including bats, musangs, rats and dogs, allow virus penyebarans between species.
In reality, only 6 amino acids are noted as different than human virus pencils and musangs in RBD and 4 of which are located in the recipetor's key motive for interaction with ACE2 recipetors.
SARS-CoV mutation of K479N and S487T on his RBD, which may increase the intersect protein interaction with the ACE2 prescription of the human.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges might be important to adapt the virus to humans.
Should be taken to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same prescriptor cells with SARS-CoV.
30% differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units of S1 protein S have effect that this protein bond between ACE2 people may have changed.
Of course, the cryo-EM research shows this bond that 10 to 20 times higher than the ACE2 human and protein SARS-CoV.
It's also interesting to determine whether any prescriptors along may be necessary for the ministry of SARS-CoV-2.
More interesting, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV recipients that exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and the selected goddamn acid of 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
It might be the responsibility to adapt to this CoV successfully in human being after the expression between species of his animal host.
In addition to cellular reception, the result of the diversion between HCoV species is also depending on host depending and other barrier factors.
These protein differences between humans and the reservoir hosts so HCoV is such a bat, arab and roden camels may create barriers between species.
HCoV needs to take the host dependencies factor and convert the host partition factor forular between successful species.
In this case, the molecular molecular molecular in the important area of these virus interactions still has not yet been identified yet and be considered.
The rest of the unimportant genome for host dependence and partition factor for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology might result.
novel HCoV conflict: back to startup
CoVwar's experience gives a great chance for novel HCoV's appearance.
From this point, CoV Kelawar is acting as a HCoV gene.
In addition, a quick and reboot of genetics also struck HCoV evolution and acted as two important steps in this process.
For example, approval or loss of novel protein encoding gene has potential to customise virus fenotipsly.
Between SARS-CoV's accessory protein, ORF8 has been considered as important in adapting to humans, because SARS-CoV's related virus has been removed but found ORF8 code.
The effects of nuclearleotida-29 SARS-CoV have been found in a range that was kept separate at the start of the human epidemik.
This ORF8 separates ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered as an adjustment mutation that encourages host exchange.
Besides, SARS-CoV has the possibility of revolved history with the descendants of CoV alpha and gama, which is a large number of smaller combinations have been identified in RNA polymerases depended on RNA.
Recognizing location is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, MERS-CoV's epidemik has been shown a resemblance between different descendants, which happened in the arab camel in the Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, registration events are also noted in another HCoV, who sees HCoV rejoining with the other coV animal in the genes.
Warning also needs to be given that false selection can contribute to an indifference change in the virus genome, which may be largely produced from liberating virus from the pressure of the selection, such as the host imunetic system.
An example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 longest in the HCoV-229E prototype thread, the result of two nukleotics.
When solid ORF4 can be seen in a bat virus and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka displays a single nukleotida scan, which generates a series of qualation.
Finally, the HCoV novel evolution is also packed by the pressure of the selection in their reservoir host.
The light assocated or symptoms have been detected only when the bat is infected by CoV, marked the adjustment between CoV and the bat.
It appears to be a very adaptable bat to CoV in anaatomy and psychology.
For example, the damage in pro-adrant response efisient efisien reduces the pathology based on CoV.
In addition, the killer cell activity is back so in the bats are blocked due to the increase of the re-examination of the killer cell controltors so the NKG2/CD94/CD94 and the low expression level for the class molecules 1 complexs of histokesation.
In addition, the level of the species of reactive oxygen (ROS) which is generated from high metabolism activity can both hold CoV's mark and impact the pruf reads by exoribonuklease, while giving the pressure to the virus's irtogenic forces are very common when they are introduced to the new host.
More Juans of the patogenic CoV may also have been evolved through rejoinment, brought to novel proteins or protein properties for adapting hosts.
So it's not a coincidence when three HCoV novels have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV is not patogenic or cause a light symptom in theirservoir host like a bat and camel.
It's double without leading a powerful host's immunity response.
This is where the secret of the source of an asstor is visible and the source of a terrible case in human disease.
Bad symptoms are most of the lung hypothetic activity and the conspicuous storm where the more powerful responses are imun, worse than lung damage.
On the other hand, in an asimptomatic feeder, the imuncient response has been out of CoV's exaggeration.
The same strategy that unlinks the imuncient response may have a beneficial effect in the anti SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very powerful in the bat.
So the interferon of type 1 is at least in the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 clause.
Besides, inflamasom activation is not working.
With this reason, the NLRP3 ingenuity with MC950 might be useful in caring for COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 consecution follows the common theme of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Even if I-CoV Kelawar share 95% the nucleotida homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also CoVwars that shares 96% nukleotida homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the other musangs and animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, a direct intercessor host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
The very homologist Beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicate that the tenggling may be one of the intersecutions or mine-CoV tenggling can contribute gene pieces to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there's a question, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans on purpose or intentionally.
The CoV has returned to being focused on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 recently.
A study of CoV in the bat and other animals has changed our view by contracted about the original interest of the zoonotic and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human space.
The widespread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a origin of the constraint and transferred to humans through the interval hosts.
Since SARS-CoV's infections are a matter of contact between humans and musangs in the market, closing wet markets and killing musangs should be able to end the SARS epidemik effective.
For the same reason, the tenggiling must be removed from the wet market to prevent the digging of the zoonotic, because by the discoveries of multiple of my descendants-CoV are related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through the circles and other mammals need to be described in the future investigation.
Instead, MERS-CoV has already been in an arab camel for a long time.
This unta has been an important tool for transportation and a major source of meat, milk, skin and hair products for the local society.
This unta is all over the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as they did in the Chinese market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent the resemblance of MERS, the complete approach must be taken to wake up effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, which are combined with other jangchance controls.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, the new genotype may appear to cause plague.
A bunch of CoV's petnotics spread in the woods.
Especially, CoVwar with the potential of the zoonotics is very different.
There's a lot of chance for the CoV zoonotics to transform and rejoin, cause a new CoV appearance that's more contagionable and/or can kill in human in the future.
The culture eats wild animals in some places in China must be stopped to reduce contact that doesn't need for humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, preparation and a better response plan should be made.
In fact, a lot of viruss have been on this planet for a long time.
The virus remains in reservoirs so that there's a chance to spread.
Although thewar has many features that simplify the spread of the virus, the opportunity of humans to have contact with the immune and other wild species can be minimized if society is diagnosed to avoid the animals.
The ongoing monitor in mammals is necessary to understand the ecology of CoV and the return host, which will prove to be useful in preventing animals to human beings and plagues in the future.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoos is to be with people from the reservoir ecology nics so for the zoonotic virus.
Some of the things that have been about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still unanswered.
First, if the sARS-CoV-2 legacy virus is contagious to tenggiling, it must be interesting to see the way the roses and the circle can share the same ecology nic.
Second, if thewar plays a more direct role in parallel to human beings, we have to determine how people can get contact with the bat.
Third, if the third mammals act as a real interpolation host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, the roses and the circles need to be explained.
Finally, seeing many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitors and infections have to be run.
Whether the roses, the circles or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar parent virus will be identified in the host again so in the future.
The ongoing presentation in this area will explain the path of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with the most important implication in the control and CVID-19 control of the human beings.
Updates the dignostic dignostic "kes suspected" and "kes authenticated" for CVID-19 required
On February 6, 2020, our team has published a quick guide line for diagnosis and coronavirus novel treatment 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide line provides our experience to be a good reference against this pandemik all over the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge has gradually increased in progress based on research discoveries that are running and clinical experience; thus, diagnosis strategies and treatments are also in the end of the day.
In this letter, we have answered a comment on our guide line and provided the new diagnostic criteria for the "exciable" and "excorded" according to the Diagnosis Guide line and CVID-19 (the seventh version) which was released by the Chinese National Health Committee’s National Committee.
In December 2019, coronavirus novel 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused a plague, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) and that virus has been named a very badly coronavirus synaviruse 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO announced COVID-10 as a pandemik.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has awakened a quick guide line and the guide has been published in the 06 February 2020 06 Research Research.
The guide has taken a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please tell me that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge of our ability has grown slow on the research discoveries that are running and the experience of clinical work; so, the diagnosis and treatments are now being updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Rawity to COVD-19’s National Health Committee released by the United States Republic of China (http://www.ncn.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 Mac 2020, has removed a number of editions of editions with a number of context changed on the rights.
Now our guide line received comments by Zhou et al, they introduced easy communication suggestions based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence for our guide line and also become a precious reference to this pandemik around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and thank you.
However, their efforts also need to be neatly followed by the Diagnosis Guides and Rawatans to COVID-19 (Edisi seven trials) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 Mac 2020), to confirm the case that it requires a combination of any item from the epidemiology history property with two cellotic items to produce a thorough analysis, or need to meet three medical event if without a clear episode history:
epidemiology history: (1) History travels or lives in the city of Wuhan and environment, or other society where COVD-19 is reported in 14 days before simptomtomtoms began; (2) history of SAR-CoV-2 case (with a positive asid nukleic test); (3) history communicates with patients with patients from the city or symptomtomtoms of the city of Wuhan and elsewhere in the history of CIVD; or the history of the 14th day before the past is related in the history of the past, or the middle-cent of the past, in the middle of the school, in a small, or the middle school, in the middle school, in a few weeks, in a class, in a few days, and in a few days, a few years ago.
clinical Manifestation: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) by the feature of COVID-19's calibration; (3) the number of white blood cells indicate normal, reduced, or less limfositions at the initial level.
The case diagnosis that has been confirmed should depend on cases that are trusted with any patogenic item or serological evidence as the following: (1) a positive time test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence the entire genome genome show a high virus homogenesis known to a known synavirus novel; (3) positive for the U.V.S.S.S. IV. IV.S.E.A., or IV.S., a special supportion of the U.S.
We can see that the real time PCR test for a nucleic acid in a breathing channel or a blood sample has added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The patogenic of the blood samples have been entered into the fourth edition of 2.7 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then the serology evidence is entered into the seventh edition.
This adjustment is based on the continued research work that seeks the optimal nucleic acids of acceleic acids to acceleration immediately, as well as samples of the breathing channel including blood samples, which increase different spesiment supplies, and supports a special antibodial positive result into the conditions that have been confirmed.
Besides, there's more evidence that reminds us to be careful with tipic patients or asimpomatis.
So, the flow charts from Zhou et al. must be updated now, because they're efficient invidivu without a clinical symptom as low.
The score system also needs to be authenticated in the practice and further clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more evidence will come and call the reader to give a comment.
To diagnosis to the suspected "kes" and "ex confirmed", we suggest to track and follow their new guide line.
Our team will also update our guidance line from time to time to offer help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVD-19, the highest number of daily lives.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths of COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in a day because of the virus.
Until last night, the Epidemiology Institute, Control and Pestion of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported the number of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 of recovery in the house.
A number of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online news, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death including four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also told the two victims are from Dhaka.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 as a pandemik on March 11.
The hospital officer told a local news source, Agent Anadolu that one of the sick is Jal Saifur benefitedan, director of Anti Rasuah Bengali, who was hospitalized at the Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in the online video announcement, the Minister of Street Transport and Bangladesh Bridge, Obaidul Quader said the public transportation would be closed longer than the original plan, so Saturday will come.
This public transportation was originally started on March 26, and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
An important transport -- drugs, oil and food -- still enabled.
The first CVID-19 infection that was recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8th, in two people who came back from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19th, the three of them have been healed.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections throughout the world.
On Thursday, the total number of coronavirus koronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is over one million in all over the world, according to the data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a plague that is coronavirus.
The sign of this level was present on the same day Malawi confirmed the first infection of koronovirus and Zambia had the first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea claims, until Thursday, it's some of the free countries of koronavirus infections.

The country in Australia has sent down the toilet paper limit once a business deal.
On Sunday afternoon and Saturday, the chain of Australia Woolworths and Coles dropped their purchase partition against the toiletsu to two and one package at all businesses in all the country stores in the national level.
ALDI also introduced a pack limit on Monday.
This limit was broadcasted as a message on the exit list, and on the Facebook page of the chain.
The buyer was reported to buy a stock of COVD-19's fear if the individual needs to separate himself.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the toilet buyer to the delivery buyer to a pack of every order.
This change is followed by a four-backed partition for every business that Woolworths and Coles are introduced to each of them at 4 and 5 Mac.
Coles, in media broadcast on March 8, reported that with a four-block run, "many stores are still out of stock in an hour after the delivery, and publishing requests as "belum ever happen", while ALD, in the Facebook delivery on Tuesday, called "untrusted".
The artifacts were increasing in the "security" last week, according to Woolworths' talks.
Costcos in Canberra also limited the amount that was allowed to two weeks ago.
To keep lighting low, Coles spilling packages greater than providers and increase the delivery friar, Woolworths spill extra stocks, while ALI made stocks for a special Wednesday plan can be obtained early.
Russell Zimmerman, the director of the Australian Construction Department, said that the lockdown was trying to add the stock but the local party partition at the time of the shipment by the truck made it difficult.
He expected to raise the product cost, when the provider tried to meet the request, and a little special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that the initial release of the stock, some stores could not engage in special Wednesday.
In News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, the runcit experts from Queensland Technology University, said the store was compiling stocks every night.
He told me the toiletsu is a big item, brought to low quantity on the stock amount, and, when it's sold, left the wider rack space, strengthening the feelings of lack.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there's all kinds of stuff on the shelf, if the product is like a toilet and unconditional material can have a quantity, you might reduce the panic that Russell Zimmerman said at ABC News.
The cycler of ours retrieving publishers Who Gives a Crap on Wednesday and they're out of stock.

The people of the country refused to wear a partition, according to one report from ABC Australia on the 3th Mac who watched them say they have no plans to introduce the limit on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also got high requests, including masks, unqualified materials, dry foods, washed hands and floors.
On the other side of Australia, on the Sunday of the highway market in the talian of Ocado was seen to limit the Andres' buyers to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as a pandemik
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVD-19’s CRID-19 plague — the disease of the SARS-CoV-2 coronarus.
Although the word "pandemik" is only referring to the whole area where the disease has spread, not how dangerous that case is, WHO is aware of the need to pressure the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemik course.
If the country is detecting, testing, treating, mengasingkan, tracking and moving their people to act, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director WHO.
We're so worried about both of the culprits and calibration stages that are competing and the stages are unreachable.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Control Center and Prevention of the United States disease, the pandic " never happened."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "from the influenza, no other breathing virus has been detected from the appearance of the entire world of communications."
Ghebreyesus says the same view, "We've never seen the pandemiks based on the coronavirus."
He continues, "and we've never seen a pandic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemik was milking the WHO's decision in January to announce the plague as a public medical emergency on international level.
The director of the Alahan and Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the plague, "The word, the situation will get worse."
As far as Thursday, the Asciated Press reports there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases all over the world, causing more than 4,600 death.
COVID-19, because of a terrible coronavirus cancer of the coronavirus. (COVD-19).
The beast was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was announced as the Public Health Department on January 30, 2020, and was proclaimed as a harvester on March 11, 2020.
At 10th April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and region, causing about 97,000 death.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The death rate of the case has been estimated 4% in China, while in the whole world between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Many common Simptoms include fevers, coughs and breaths.
Complications may include pneumonia and syndrome atstres respirator.
Time of exposure to the beginning of the symptom is usually about five days, but it may be between two and twelve days.
There's no known vactions or special treatments.
The main treatment is the automated therapy and support. Preventure measures include washing hands, closing their mouths, keeping distances from other people, and monitoring and monitoring themselves for those who suspected themselves.
The authorities all over the world have been reacting by running travel barriers, quarantines, prison orders, dangerous controls at work and fasility covers.
This Pandemik has led to global sosioekonomi disorder, bans, sports cancellation, religious, political and culture, and lack of supply covered by panic purchases.
The schools and university have been closed either across the country or at the local level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world students's population.
The wrong information about the virus has been spread online, and there's a source of xenofobia and discrimination to Chinese people, other people raced and looked in and East Asia and Southeast Asia, and they were from the area with a significant virus case.
As the reduction of travels and heavy industry covers, there are drops in air pollution and carbon releases.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (ibu of the Hubei region) reported pneumonia’s pneumonia in December 31, 2019, and the investigation was launched at January 2020.
Most of the cases have a connection with the Borong Food Sea of Huanan and led the virus to the origin of the zoonotic.
The virus that causes the plague to be known as SARS-CoV-2, the new virus that was closely connected to the rose coronavirus, the tenggilrus coronavirus, and the early SARS-CoV. The person was found sick on December 1, 2019, and that person had no contact with the wet choir market.
For the early case collateral reported on December 2019, two thirds are found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 2020, a report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case detected back to November 17, 2019, in a patient from the Hubei region, probably the first case. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that when a new case was reported in Italy, Iran and Iranea South, a case outside of China was greater than the first case in China.
There may be a number of cases not reported the match, especially among them with lighter symptoms.
So 26th February, it's relative to only a case that has been reported among the teenagers, with those who are 19 years old and down to 2.4% cases all over the world.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested to CVID-19, and the test has been positively confirmed by official protocols.
At 23th March, no state has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries that have officially had to not test those who have a light symptoms alone, such as Italian, Dutch, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, it has estimated 86% of CVID-19 not been detected, and that this uncoded infection is a source of 79% cases recorded.
statistical analysis published in March 30 estimate that the number of infections in Italy are larger than the case reported.
A initial increase number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of the U.S. Disasing that the number may be 5.7.
Most of the people with the COVID-19 are recovering.
In the case of the development of the symptom until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common one is 14 days.
At 10th April 2020, about 97,000 death has been associated with COVID-19.
In China, the 5 February of about 80% of death is within them over 60 years, and 75% health problems are available including cardiovaskular and diabetes.
The real death number of COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include those who die without being tested in the house, at the nursing center, etc.
A half of Italy data found that the number of deaths were overrundated during the pandicks exceeded the official COVID's death count with a 4-5x factor.
A woman's talker for the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of the A.S. (C.S.) states: "We know that [specified death] is less than a few", the statement that was supported by a report about less than counting in A.S. A.S. A. A. Activation often occurs in a demiciation, such as during the H111N1 flu flu epidek of 2009N1, the first death was confirmed on January 9,20.
The first death, outside China, occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and first death outside Asia was on February 14, France.
Until February 28, outside of China, more than a dozen dead countries have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italian.
So 13th Mac, more than forty countries and region have reported death, in every continent except Antarctica, some steps have been used to say death quantity.
This number is different from the area and by the time, and the number of tests, health care quality, treatment options, times since the initial outbreak, and the population properties such as age, body, body, and the entire health. Assumptions of death are divided by case being divided by the case of the diagnose in a given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death with global cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) sets up 10 April 2020.
It's different than the area.
In China, the estimates for the ratio of death with a case down from 17.3% (to them with a symptom of January 2020) to 0.7% (for them with a symptom start after 1 February 2020). Other reference to the case rate of death (CFR), which describes the percent of their disease, and the death rate of the stroke (IFR) which is described as the percent of the infected and the disease they have not been killed.
This statistics are not bound to time and follow a special population of infections through the case solution.
A number of academys have been trying to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Union Center based on the Oxford University's proof that the death rate of infection for the pandemiks is a wholely between 0.1% and 0.39%.
Upgrade for this range is consistently dnegan results from the first random test for CVID-19 in Germany, and statistic research that analyzes the effects of the test at CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that the pandics can be controlled.
The length of the top and the top of the plague is unrecognizable and can be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from the Penn State University states: "Let's not check, cramped plagues usually spread around and then begin to suffer when the disease is out of a houser.
But almost impossible to make any sense now about the time it will happen."
The right medical advice of the Chinese kingdom Zhong Nanshan is determined that the "pandemik is to end up by Jun" if all countries can be moved to obey the advice of WHO's steps to stop the cellular.
In March 17th, Adam Kucharski of the Kingdom School of Tropica London, said that SARS-CoV-2 would continue, perhaps for a year or two.
According to a Imperial College study that was led by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps will be required "to make the vaccine available (perhaps 18 months or more."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I don't think it's possible this coronavirus -- because it's very easy to spread-- it's going to be completely lost" and it's "may be a seasony disease, coming back each year."
The return surface will depend on the imunition of groups and mutation level.
Cimptom CVID-19 can be relatively unspecified and those who are infected may be asimpomatic.
The most common symptom is the fever (88%) and dry rocks (68%).
The rare Simptoms include tired, respirator sputums, loss of smell, breaths and spawns, abjection disease, emotional pain, cold pain, hemroptics, hemtics, hemotics or sianosis.
A.C. Control Center of Disease Control and Prevention, A.S., list an emergency symptom as a breathing problem, pain or pressure on a constant chest, misfortune failure, sleeps, and eyes or lips become behavioral; medical treatments are soon charged.
Some who are infected may be asimptomatically, with no clinical symptoms but with a test that confirms the infection, researchers have suggested that they are contacted with infected individuals to be infected and checked to make sure that there is no infection.
China estimates the ratio of asimptomatic to a little bit of 44%.
The common reconing period (the time between the infection and the cycle starts) is about half of one to 14 days; most commonly five days. For example, the fraction of a person who suffers from CVID-19 who loses their smell at first 30% and then fall to 15%.
Some details of the way the disease continue to develop are still being determined.
The disease was often widely distributed during a close contact and through a small typhoon that came up during a cough, spread, or speaking; with contact is at the distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Investigations have found that unprotected rocks would cause a 4.5 meters (15 m) to 8.2 feet (27 m).
Some have concluded that the virus might also be transferred through permanent small typhoons in the air, which may be generated when speaking, perhaps during a breath - way, including when it talks, even if the virus is generally not an air carrying.
The Titican can land in the mouth or the nose of the nearer or may be held into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubtion and cardiopulmonari are possible to cause respiratory respirators to melt and thus produce air’s spread.
The virus can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then they touch their eyes, noses or mouths.
Although there's a virus anxiety that can spread through shit, it's trusted risk is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of observant to SARS-CoV-2's mouth is the most simplest infections in the first three days after the first three days of simptoms, but the infection may happen before the simptom appears and then the stage of the disease.
One has been tested positive for the disease until three days before the symptoms suggested that the expression could happen before a significant symptom.
Just a little bit of a symptomatic case report that exists, but an invetomatic expression has been identified by some countries during contact investigation.
The European Disease Control and Control states that even though it is not so easy to spread, a person usually spread two to three other people.
Specially, the virus was found to be detected for three days on plastic (polipropilena) and the rheasant takes 304, for a day on a cardbod, and for four hours on copper.
This, however, is different from the energy and temperature, the pets and other animals have been tested positively tested for COVID-19.
There's no evidence that animals can move the virus to humans, but the British authorities suggest to wash hands after touching animals, like after touching other surfaces that might have touched them.
Bad quant snail syrrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus novel, beginning to be separated from three people with pneumonias related to the quantary disease of Wuhan.
All of the aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virus novels are related to coronaviruses in nature.
The virus expected to have the origin of the zoonotic.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically exclusive with the Gene Betacoronavirus genus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (B) together with two threads that are obtained from the bat.
The virus is 96% similar to the level of genome full of other chronavirus chronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in a particular part of the genome sequence between the virus from tenggling with the virus of humans.
The difference of the whole genomes so that it's now found at least 92% genetic materials shared between the coronaviruss and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove a circle as a intersection home.
The infection by the virus could be diagnosed for a while based on a symptom, even if the business finally goes through the transcency of a polymerase response (rRT-PCR) for a infected brake or CT.
A study that compares the PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, even less specific, with most of its identical features overlapping with pneumonia and other diseases.
As far as March 2020, the American Radiology Kolej recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as the first test of the line to diagnose CVID-19".
WHO has published some RNA test protocol for SARS-CoV-1, with the first one released on January 17th.
The test uses transcryption to turn the polymerase response (rRT-PCR) for real time.
This test can be run on a respirator sample or blood.
Test results are usually available in a few hours until a few days.
Normally this test is running with the nasofaringeal swab but the cords can also be used. A number of labs and companies are up to the serology test, which detects antibodi.
So by April 6, 2020, no of this test has proved pretty accurate to pass for use widely.
In the U.S. ecology test built by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by the laboratory only.
The feature of the descriptions on radiographs and a computer tomographs (CT) for a conspicuous oang including an asimetrik and pleura fusi.
The Italian Radology unit is collecting an online database between the flying to find identical for a valid case.
Since the scanning with other infections such as adenovirus, the confirmation of the PCR is limited in identifying CVID-19.
A big study in China compares the CT's chest results with CR and shows that even though the identicals are specific for infections, the method is faster and more sensitive, using the method considerations as a saring tool in the epidemik area.
The neural network based on artificial intelligence has been built to detect the implication of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
The strategy to prevent illness from keeping cleaned, wash your hands, avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouths with unsanced hands, and tucks or stoves and then put the tubes into the trash.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgery masks in public.
The physical prison step is also recommended to prevent the impulsion, and many governments have restricted or advised to avoid all travels to and from countries affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the range of community in the big part of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in community, and some community experts don't know where they're infected or how they're infected.
The use of the location of a cell phone by the government for this purpose has raised anxiety about privacy, with Amnesty International and the other 100 organizations bring the reality that ask for limitation to these surveillances.
Multiple mobile apls have been applied or recommended for volunteer use, and as far as 7 April 2020, over as the expert group is working a nicely privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth to log a user near him with another cell phone.
The user then received a message if they had contacted someone who had been tested positive to CVID-19. Wrong reactions are running about how to prevent infections; for example,biling noses and washings with mouth washing are not effective.
No COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are trying to wake up vaccines.
Sanctifying hands are recommended to avoid the plague's displacement.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands regularly using soaps and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after giving a nose, cough, or snuck.
It's because it's outside the human body, the virus was killed by the soap of the house, which destroys the refugee loop.
The CDC next recommends using alcohol based hands based on at least 60% alcohol according to the content when soap and water are not available to use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, noses, or mouths with unconditional hands.
Surface may be contaminated with a number of late (in a minute of disabling to calibration to currice surface, including 62 (1991% etanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% hyoklorit sodium, 0.5% hydroxide, and 0.2%.5% povidon-iodin.
Other Lautans, like chlorida and chropicsdina glunat, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID case was suspected or confirmed in facilities such as the office or the center of the day, all areas such as the office, the water room, the public area, the electronic device shared like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and the ATM machines that are used by the sick, should be unqualified.
Health organizations recommend that the people close their mouths and noses with their arms bent on rock or slings, and removing any type of tissues immediately.
The surgery masks are recommended for those who may be infected, because using masks can limit the number and elusive distances that are spread while talking, insects, and rocks.
WHO has taken orders about time and way to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, the virology at the University of Leeds, "Fie a mask can reduce the tendency of a person to touch their face, which is the primary source of hygient hands." To the mask is also recommended to be used by those who care for the illness.
IF YOU've been using the masks by those who are healthy just if they risked high risks, as they care for those who are affected by CVID-19, even though they also acknowledge that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by community members.
In A.S., the CDC recommends using non- medical masks made from cloths. China has specifically recommended the use of medical masks to remove the health experts, especially when they are meeting (13 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask while using public transportation or in a crowded area.
We were encouraged by the Thailand health officer to make a monetary mask at home and to wash it every day.
Czech and Slovakia Republic forbids to go out to public places without wearing masks or closing noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austria government decreed that all who enter the race store had to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all inhabitants to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid Mac, requesting passengers trains and buss between the city to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has made up a face mask when it comes out, as well as using a mask in the house for those who can't buy face masks.
Even the appearance masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social spacing (also known as a physical prison) accompanied by the actions of the infection that are intended to slow the disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel partitions; and school covers, jobs, stadiums, theaters or mathematical centers.
People can do social prison methods by staying at home, by limiting their journeys, by exaggerating areas, by exotic manners, and physical abuses.
Many governments are now required or recommend social prisons in areas that are affected by the plague.
Maximum assembly size recommended by the U.S. government body and health organizations quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no CVID-19 CVIDUD in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, German forbids public assembly by more than two people. The older adults and they are with deep health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, hypothesis, and the immovative systems are compiled for serious diseases and have been advised to remain in the area of the community.
The use of the " social education" has brought to replication that people should have a full social distribution, rather than encourage them to communicate with others in alternative ways. Some of them have removed sexual health manuals to use during the harvest.
This includes the suggestions to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who has no virus or the virus symptom.
The self-recognizing in the house has been recommended to those detected by COVID-19 and those who suspected had been infected.
The health agent has issued detailed instructions for the correct self-reproduction. Many governments have given mandats or suggesting the quarantine to the entire population living in the crashed area.
The strongest quarantine order has been removed to those who belong to a high risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with CVID-19 and those who had traveled to the country or region with an extended remark had been advised to undergo an endless quarantine for the last 14 days of the last period of reduction.
The strategy in control of the plague is blocking or oppressing, and reduction.
Assumptions are run at the beginning of the plague and targets to track and separate the infected ones and introduce the jangcinations and other vaccines to stop disease from spreading to population remnants.
If it's no longer possible to block the cerebral of the disease, the effort then switch to the distribution level: steps are taken to slow down and reduce the effects of health care and public care system.
A step combination is blocking and cutting down may be run at the same time.
Pressures need a more strict step to resign the environment by reduceing basic reproduces to less than 1. Some of them manage the calibration of infections are trying to lower the epidemik peak, known as the sum of epidemik.
It reduces the risk of health service to be more burden and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be built.
The hand is not a pharmacy that can manage the reinterlact including personal physics, such as handwriting, wearing face masks, and quarantinentins, which are targeted in the physical prisons like closing school and canceling the big event; the community's renovatives to encourage the reception and intersections in such as the surface of the surface; and so the way the environments are made to disclosures to be taken after the city’s cotation and the substation.
Other countries also take many steps suggested to limit the cellular.
South Korea introduces the great and local development, and warns about infected individuals' movements.
Singapore provides financial support for those who infected themselves and put on high amounts to those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the income of face masks and devising medical supplies. Simulation for the Great Britain and the United States indicate that reduction (ensumption but did not discontinue the spread of epidemik) and delaying (returning epidemik growth) was a major challenge.
Optimised reduction may reduce the demands of health - care that cover to 2/3 and death as well as a half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of death and the health system to be at risk.
The reason can be a choice but it must be kept as long as the virus goes into a population of people (or until the vaccine is there, if it comes first), because the spread will soon resurface when the steps are obliviated.
Long-term hands to push the pandemik result in social and economic cost.
No specific drugs are passed for COVID-19, but the attempt to wake it is running, including testing the existing drug.
With the fluestic medicine given in the dinter, drink water and rest will help lighten the symptom.
Depends on credentials, oxygen therapy, liquid intravena and breathing support may be needed.
The steroid use may cause the consequences.

The laboratory test for the death chronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus associated including the method to detect the presence of the virus and the method that detects the antibodies produced as a response to the infection.
Violent presence in samples confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA chronavirus.
This test is special and designed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
That test was used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibodi (serology) will be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibodi tests indicate the number of patients who have suffered from the disease, including those who have symptoms are too light to report or asimpomatic.
The death rate due to an accurate disease and the imunition of groups in the population can be determined from this test decision.
As a limited test, as far as March 2020 no state has the data that can be expected of the virus areas in their population.
Until 23 Mac, no state has tested more than 3% of their population, and there's a lot of noise in the number of tests that have been done all over the countries.
These are also likely to damage the death rate that is reportedly reported, which may be overly distributed in some countries.
Using transcryption changes polymerase response (rRT-PCR) the real time of test can be performed on samples of respirators obtained through various methods, including nasofaringeal and sputum samples.
His decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test that was done with a cord can only be trusted in the first week of illness.
Then the virus could be lost in the throat and continues to double in the lungs.
For those who are infected in the second minngu, alternative sample materials can then be taken from in a tig airway using a denominator or material that causes rocks (sputum) to be used.
One of the early PCR tests was built in Chari Tamwan in Berlin on January 2020 using a transcryption of polyemerase response (rRT-PCR) real time, and being the base for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also awakened a test by January 23, 2020. South Korea Company of Kogenebiotech awakening SARS-CoV-2-based PCR, the kilinic gerChek Coronavirus on January 28, 2020.
It's looking for a "E" gene shared by all my coronaviruses, and a special RdRp gene to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first companies who received emergency use of the United Nations Plants of the United States's C.C.D.
One of the three genetic tests in the old cit version of the test result of a broken reagenement, and the bottle's neck test in CDC in Atlanta; this is about less than 100 samples this day successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Test using two components could not be trusted until February 28, 2020, and before that country lab and locality are allowed to start the test.
The test was passed by by food and Dadah's administration under the Percemasan Use Truth, the U.S. commercial Makmal started a test at the beginning of March 2020.
As far as 5 Mac 2020 LabCorp announces COVID-19's test supply based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics is also the same test of the COVD-19 is available in the whole country from 9 Mac 2020.
No quantity limit was announced; specimen group and processing must be run according to the CDC needs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was built and produced by the Virology Research Center and the Biotechnology of the U.S. State V.E.
On February 11, 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for the Watching of Health on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinics were reported to awaken the test to detect CVID-19. on March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's graduation for test that could be done in 3.5 hours, and allow one machine to perform 4,8 hours in the test.
On March 19, 2020, FDA released an emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test over the m2000 Abbott system; FDA before doing the same truth to Hologyc, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has failed the test that used the nucleic nucletermal acid technology instead of PCR.
Since this test doesn't need a change of temperature cycle that changes this method can give positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At this time there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expected to accelerate 50,000 tests a day. The test used antibodi monoklons specifically tied up to a nuclearleoksid proteon (N protein) the chronavirus novel is being built in Taiwan, with the hope of this test in 15 to 20 minutes like the fast influenza test.
On March 2020, a written review concluded that "radiograph chest has a small diagnostic value at the initial stage, while the CT discovery of CT [komputerography] may have been present even before the simptom starts."
The CT tipics include the opacity of a multilobar-wisthesis of multilobars with accurate distributions, asimemetrics and postteriors.
Subpleura domination, openings and merges are formed when the disease is efficient.
A study that compares the PCR to the CT at Wuhan's original point at the current pandemiks has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, even less specific, with many of its identical features act with pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Kolej recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as the first line test for CVID-19". Set up Mac 2020, CDC recommends PCR for early saring.
Some of the imunciation response to infections are antibodiings including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect the infections in individuals starting 7 days or so after the simptom starts, to determine the gradient, and in the population surveillance. The evaluate can be done in the center lab (CLT) or via point-of-care (PoCT) test.
The system's automated high in many clinical labs will be able to run this judgment but its availability will depend on the development rate for each system.
For a single specimen of specimen of blood usually used, even the serial specimen can be used to follow the imunal response.
To PoCT a single spesiment of blood is usually obtained through the tubes on the skin.
It's not like the PCR method of scouting is not necessary before judgment, on March 26, 2020, FDA named 29 entities who presents the agency as needed and so it can now pass their antibodi test.
At 7th April 2020, only one test was passed by the FDA under an emergency usage. I at the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the European graduation for their test kits, which could detect the antibodidi IgA and the virus in the blood samples.
Test capasity is a few hundred samples in a few hours and so it's much faster to the PCR of the conventional PCR for the virus RNA.
Antibodis usually can be detected 14 days after the infection began. In early April, UK found no antibodi tests purchased pretty well to use.
Hong Kong has provided a schema that watches the patients can stay in the house, "it will provide a spessian tube to the patient," they send back and get the test results soon later. The British NHS has announced that he's been pioneering to test the case in the house, which is moving out of the risk that the patients to cross the hospital, if they need to go to the hospital or the E.D.
Last drive center has helped South Korea to do some of the most common tests of the country, in Germany, the United States’s Integration of the Statutori Health Health Department said at 2 Mac, that they have a 12,000 a day’s capacity in a series of amhori and 10,700s have been tested in the past week.
Suggestions are held by health insurance when a test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has the entire capacity of 1600,000 test a week.
As far as the 19th Mac test drives has been offered in several large cities.
At March 26, 2020 the number of tests done in Germany are unknown, because only positive results are reported.
The first lab review reveals that until the first week of the calendar 12/202020 is as many as 483,295 samples have been tested including the week 12/202020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) test positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, the study of Technion Hospital and Rambam will test the samples to test samples from 64 patients at the same time, with a positive sample and a positive sample after which is shown. In a year after which a sample is shown. In a year 2000-round, which is shown by "Ho-day Chinese" is called "Matchan" or "Picking more than 2000" in a more than 20th century.
With the building that was monitored by the BGI Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown cases in Hubei will be over 47% high and collaborated to control the quarantine if the test capacity doesn't reach target.
Makmal Wuhan has quickly been examined by Hou Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a number of 12 cities throughout China.
So 4 Mac 2020 per day's total amount is 50,000 test a day. The open source, designs multipleks which are released by Origami Assays have been released to test 1122 patient samples for CVID19 using only 93 evaluates. This balanced design can be run in small labs without needing robotic liquid control.
Until Mac, lack and lack of enough reagens have been packed for the big test in EU and in UK and in the United States.
This has moved some authors to explore sample setup protocols that involve the samples at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove RNA genomes for the next test. On 31 Mac Mac has announced that the United Arab Emeriah was testing more people for the Coronavirus each head than any other country, and being on the right path to improve the test scale of the population.
It's through the last driver's abilities, and the buyer of the population-stunes of the 42 and BGI group. (formed to the emergency station "Hou-Yan" in China)
Constructed in 14 days, this lab was able to run thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and was the first in the world in this scale to control outside China.
A different test edahrah which targets different parts of the chronavirus genetic profile has been built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization received the use of German income that was sent to the country’s lack of power to wake our own kits.
German method was published on January 17, 2020; protocol built by the United States Disease Control Center is not available until January 28, slowing down the existing tests in the U.S. and the United States have a problem with the belief of the test at the beginning of his cetus, and the Australia is not enough to provide enough kits to meet the demand and suggestions for health experts.
Instead, experts tell South Korea’s vast use in making tests to reduce coronavirus novels.
Test capacity, most of them are in private sectors, built in a few years by South Korea government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called to increase a test program as the best way to slow the COVID-19's pandemik speed. A high request for a test of a vast virus collision caused hundreds of thousands of tests in the private lab A.S., and chemical duplicity supply is limited.
On March 2020 China reported a problem with accuracy on their test kit.
In the United States, the test kits built by the CDC have "weakness;" the government then removes the bureaucracy partition that have blocked a private test. The Spanish nation bought a test kit from the Chinese Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found his decision to be unfair.
They suggested that it was wrong to collect samples or to right - hand cits.
The Spanish Ministry says it's going to retract that returns the wrong decision, and will replace it with a different test kit that Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the Chech Republic bought a wrong decision from China.
The Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit was removed to Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Department told the Chinese test kit that was bought from China and not "only a high mistake". The UK government bought 3.5 million kit tests from China but at the beginning of 2020, this test kit is not to be used.
Tests, followed by the recommendations of those who were tested positive and detecting those related to positive individuals SARS-CoV-2 in, giving positive results.
Researchers working in Vo in Italy, the first death base of COVID-19 in Italy, run two rounds of tests at the entire population almost 3,400 people, about ten days.
Almost half of a positive person has no symptom, and all the cases found have been quarantined.
With the trip partition, this has eliminated the new infection completely.
With a aggressive contact check, a partition of traveling in, a test, and quarantine, coronavirus 2020 in Singapore has moved slower than another building country, but without a strict partition like the disposing restaurant and the shops of runcit.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore has begun to advised the people to sit in the house on March 28, but the school will be opened again on time after a vacation on March 23, more.
Some other countries have also been controlling the domination by detecting contact aggressively, travel partitions, test and quarantine, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistic study found that more countries make more tests, relative to the number of deaths, had a low death rate, perhaps because these countries can detect those who only have a light cycle or nothing better.
WHO suggests that countries do not have a test capacity and a national lab with limited experience about COVD-19 send five first positive samples and ten negative samples CVID-19 to one of the 16 references labs to the verification test.
From 16 labs references, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positivity column as % test" is held under a state test base.
The country who is just testing the individual who entered the hospital will have a higher positive value as % test than the country to test all the people, whether they show a symptom or not, the rest is the same.
Breating hands, also known as the hygiene, is the works of cleaning someone's hands that are meant to remove the land, fat, microorganism, or other unwanted materials.
Takes hands with soap consistently on certain critical times in the day preventing many diseases, for example of the vet and year, which is spread through the unclean path to mouth.
Also, people may become infected with breathing disease, such as influenza or common fluesa, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths (cth., membrane of mukus).
Five times critical in the day that watches wash hands with soaps are important, including before and after throwing large water, after cleaning the child's back or turning the lampin, before feeding children, before eating and before and after preparing food or feeding raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap are not available, the hand can be washed with ashes.
Before you can eat, for some time you need to prepare.
Before and after controlling the sick.
After changing the lightin or cleaning the children who used the toilet.
After sniffing the nose, cough or sniffing.
After touching animals, animals, or animal shit.
medical reinanct hygiene can refer to the clean practices that are associated with medical procedures.
Takes hands before handling medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the disease.
The primary purpose of washing the hands is to clear the hands of the patogen (chent, virus or other microorganism that can cause disease) and chemicals that can lead to dangers or illness.
It is especially important to those who control food or work in medicine, but it is also a major practice in the public.
Hands had a lot of health benefits, including degrading fluentness, coronavirus and other disease; preventing causes of certification; reduce respirator infections;
And lower the baby's death rate when it's born at home.
A study in 2013 shows the practice of washing a good hand will bring to a small growth in a child's high growth under the age of five.
In the country builds, death rates in the childhood that are related to breathing disease and suits can be reduced by introduceing easy behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This easy step can reduce the rate of death due to this disease to nearly 50%.
The intervenction that encourages hands can lower the episod of the sheept as much as one per third, and it can compare with providing clean water in the low-seed area.
48% of the episod implication may be associated with washing hands with soapse. With the hand with soapse is the only effective and unusable way to avoid the features and clauses of breathing (ARI), as an automatic act performed in the house, school and the entire society.
Pneumonia, the main ARI, is the cause of death number one among children under five years, sacrificed lives about 1.8 million children a year.
The sheept and pneumonia are taking almost 3.5 million children's death every year.
According to the UNICEF, planting the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilets can save more lives than any single vaccine or drug mixing, reduce death due to half and death of a single quantity.
Needs hands are generally combined with other sanitation hands as part of the water program, sanitation and cleanness (WASH).
Needing hands can also protect from the violation that is moved via physical contact directly.
A small effect that the washing of hands is too often the washing of hands can lead to cramped skin damage in the skin.
A study of Denmark in 2012 found the washing of hands can take a lot togatals, a sideic skin known as the eczema of the hand or hand hartis, which used to be among the health care workers.
Too often the hands are seen as one of the obsesive obsesif disorders (OCD).
There are five days critical times during which washing hands with soap is important to reduce the obligatory transfer of unclean plague to the mouth: after using the sign (kencing, peck), after cleaning the child's backs (cattering), before giving the child, before eating and before/selepas provides food or keeping raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when the way to wash the hands should be properly practice to avoid diseases including before and after caring for the cuts or wound; after having a cought, or a nose; after touching shit or animals; and after the trash.
The washing rate using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, studies washed hands in 54 countries found that average 38.7% of the property had a washing hands with soap. In 2014, the research shows the Arabs have the highest size of 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle of 77 percent; and China at the low rate of conductal changes are now available to improve their hands with socucians at the soap at the critical time.
Special Health Control Programs that are implemented by the Educational Department in the Philippines are an example of a great act to provide health and child education.
cing twice a year, added by washing hands every day with soaps, and rubping teeth every day with florida. It's the core of this national program.
It has been successful in Indonesia.
The microorganism of the skin can be enhanced by adding soap or detergen into water.
Soap and detergen's primary action is to reduce obstacles on the end, and increase the silence.
The water isn't just a good skin cleaner because fat and protein, which is a organic component, not sloppy in water.
However, a proper flow of water helps cleaning.
Because of the nature that can be reused, the ketul soap may save the bacteria that are obtained from the previous use.
A few studies about bacteria transfers from contaminated soap found that transfers are not possible because bacteria are removed when washed with the busa.
CDC site still specifies "security flowed without using a hand is better".
The antibakiac has a high promotion to most of the healthful people.
There's no evidence of this so far that using antieptic or disinfects that are recommended to choose antibiotic control organisms.
However, the antivisibility soap contains a regular anti-sticter agent such as tricolosans, which have a list of exaggeration of organisms.
So, even if antibodi's arrest was not chosen by an anticreation soap, it might not be as good as it was.
In addition to surphact and skin cover agents, this advanced formula, this is probably contains asid asetic, asid tanyaorbik, asid streaktic acids, as pH, antimzocs active asids and more skinapis (aloe vera,lactor, puts, substantial, extraks). The collisionist analysis of the University at the University University’s University shows that the normally has the same elemental effects of the intersectation of the user’s synaps which contains pH and non-s phedicate disease.
The water isn't too much hot to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bakter multiplys faster at the temperature (37 °C).
In contrast, warm water is more effective than cold waters to remove oil so that they have soil and bacteria.
As many people believe, scientific research indicates that using silk water has no effect on the lowering of microbs.
The sleever or the antipick is an agent who's not based on water.
At the end of 1990-an and part of the 21th century, the alcohol of the cleaning agent based on no water (also known as a gososo based on alcohol, the anti-separtic hands, or the cleaningr) began to be popular.
Most of them are gliserin's alcohol isopropils or ethanols that are organized along with the denominary agents like Karbomer (polimer craric acid) into the gel, or humpertane like gliserin into liquid, or busa for use ease and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
By adding the hydroxide hydroxide that will increase the antimikroba activity, the cleaninger that contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol is an excellent quarantine.
Gosole alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria hold friends like drugs and VRE, tuberculosis and several viruss (including HIV, herpes, Rhinovirus, vacinia, influenza and heptis).
The alcohol cleaner that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (e.g. 3.5 log reduction, is equal to 35 desibels) bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (relection 4 to 5 logs) bacteria on the hands of 1 minutes after use. The most effective hands on bacteria and less effective bacteria.
The grueling of alcohol is almost almost not working on the Norovirus virus (or Norwalk), causing the most common gastretivity. Anticipity of the alcohol or gustation that must be used to dispose or protect both hands properly.
The front and the back of both hands and between the ends of all the fingers are rubbed for less than 30 seconds until liquid, busa or gel becomes dry.
The finger tip must also be washed well, with clutching it in both hands, the Control and the U.S. Control Center, washed the hands instead of the cleaning of the hands, especially when the hands look dirty.
The use of this agent is increased because it's an easy use and a quick murder activity against microorganism, however, it can't replace proper hands unless there's no soap and water.
The use of the sculpture is often based on alcohol can cause dry skins except eolien and/or skinmbers added on formulas.
The effects of dry alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding gliserin and/or other emolien on formulas.
In a clinical test, a glover based on alcohol that contains eoliens cause a significant reduction and frequency on skins rather than soap or antimic deternations.
Deactivate contact of an ally, contact urtikaria or hyersensity of alcohol or extra material in alcohol’s carts are rare.
The power to lower the clutches of contact over which is to pull into the pull instead of using soap and water to wash hands.
Agents are not water, although effective, not cleaning hands from organics, it just erases the quarane.
Because this is the cleaner not so effective than soaps and water to avoid the spread of many patogens, because patogens are still on hand.
The waste of alcohol cleaning is talled to its ingredients and formulas, and in its history it is less successful than alcohol and alcohol.
In recent years, a formula that uses chlorida benzalkonium has been proven to have an ongoing antimikroba activity and quarantionatively after use, not like the alcohol that proves to be reduced after many times, it's possible because the reactions are not appropriate to the skin is progressif.
In contrast, the majority of people feel that they cannot afford soaps, using ashes or soil.
Abu or land may be more effective than using water but may be less effective than soap.
Poverty exists if land or ashes are contaminated with microorganism that may increase from lowering disease.
Abu is also an agent of a quaman such as soap because it shapes alkali's solutions if you have contact with water.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap if soaps are not available.
The U.S. Dispose of the U.S. Dispose the correct hand technique to prevent illnessal use such steps as the following:
Smells with water flowing or cold.
The water flows suggested that the stand may be contaminated by, at the same time the water seems to have no effect.
It's got a handcut with a lot of soaps, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under my nails.
Sabun threw a cube from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when they used soap instead of water.
Sental at least 20 seconds.
Interesting creates the shift, which helps rid the quarant from the skin, and isyaing with longer wasteing more cubes.
Whens well with flowing water.
Assuming in the besen can reenter the hands.
Closing with clean tuala or letting it dry up by the air.
The wet hands and glue are easier to be dirty again, my mother, my wrists, the parts between the fingers and the finger below are part that always misses.
Mikroorganism may be stored in false nails and my misfortune paints.
Loection can always be recommended to avoid hands from dry; dry skin may cause skin damage that can increase the risk of jangchication transfer.
There are many cheap options to ease the handwashing if there's no pipe water and/or soapse water, e. g. from tucking or pumping with a proper hole if it needs to be in the country. If it's limited water supply (as in school or out of building cities), there is a solution that saves water like "paippi" and another cheap choice.
Tipe tips are easy technology that use the jags hung on a rope, and the towels which are controlled by feet to bring some water over their hands and a sketch of soap.
The important part in the cleaning process is a effective handring, but there are debates about the most effective form of drying in public waterrooms.
The more studies show the paper tuals are much more cleaner than the electrical sculptures found in most of the airrooms.
In 2008, a study was made by University of Westminster, London, and was held by the paper tuala industries of Europe’s Tisu’s Tisu, to match the cleanest level when using paper tuala, warm air ceiling and modern air - handing.
After washing and drying hands with warm airrings, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingerhelds are found at average over 194% and at the hands of 254%.
Produce with jet airring causes the increase of bacteria at the bottom of the finger to be average of 42% and at the hand site of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper tuala, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the end so average is reduced to 76% and on the hand base until 77%. The Saintis also performs the test to determine whether the intercesssive scanners occur from other waterrooms and the environment of the water room of each kind of work.
The jet air supplyer, which shuts out of the unit at the speed of 180 m/s (650 km/jam; 400 bsj), was able to simulate microorganisma from the hands and the unit and potentially disarming the other water room user and the environment of water room two feet [2 m].
The use of the warm airrings spread microorganism until 0.25 meters from the scout.
In 2005, a study made by the und Umwelt und Umwelt examines a different handring method.
The following changes are available in bacteria count after the hold of the hand:
There are many different scouters of handwriting, and the scaling is compared to paper tuala for drying.
Sancking hands using the sleeves into alternatives when traveling on no soaps and water.
The collisioner needs to contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Sancking hands for medical has long been an obligation when Ignake Semmelweis's doctor from Hungary found his success (at 1846) in the obligatory disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices who warn hospital personnel to wash hands when they forget.

It avoids the hands being dirty when touching the surface.
Sancking hands in health care environment is meant to remove the patogen microorganisma "" and avoid spreading it.
New England Journal of Medicine reported that unsublished hands are not allowed in many medical environments, with a lot of doctors and nurses routinely forgot to wash hands before touching patients, and then spread microorganism.
One study shows how to wash hands properly and other simple procedures can reduce blood flow rates related to 6 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing the standard to wash and rub hands in health care sectors.
The draft guides on the hygient hands that this organization can also be found on his website to comment others.
A recent study that is relevant has been done by Whitby et al.
The commercial device can measure and confirm the hand hygiene, if the controller is required.
The World Health Organization has "Lima Momen" to wash the hands:
after exposed to the body/security
Before the aseptic task, and
After caring for patients. Additional antipic chemicals on soapsea (before "bat" or "antimikrobial" act to kill agents of washing hands.
The murder action like that may be wanted before doing surgery or in the state where the antibiotic control organisms are very widespread. For the hands of someone's surgery, there's need to be able to turn on and off without touch with hands, some of klorhecines or iodins, the iodins to dry hands after wash up, and the ilsters to ilsters and other aids to clean me under my fingers.
All the jewelry needs to be held.
This procedure needs to wash your hands and arms down until my elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
The long gosok time (10 minutes) is not required.
While inbiling, water on the bottom arm must be blocked from flowing back to hand.
After we finished washing hands, the hands were covered with steril cloths and the surgery clothes were used.
To lessen the ministry of quantity, it would be better to wash up or use an anticipation before and after caring for the sick.
To control the staff's infection in the hospital, it's the biggest benefit of handwashing coming from the first 20% cleaning, and it's very few benefits when the washing frequency increases over 35%.
Closing with soaps used to produce more than three times the currical disease rates that are moved to food than to wash the antitches.
But soap and water is more effective than the artifacts based on alcohol to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spora disil Klostridium from the hands.
There is a need for more research on which intervensi is the most effective in your health environment.
In the country of building, washing hands with soaps were recognized as effective and vital tools to achieve good health, as well as good foods.
However, the shortage of water can be hoped for, soap or cleaning hands in the house, at school and at work makes it a challenge to reach global washings.
For example, in most of the cities of Africa, plumbered hands close to each private and public toilets are very rare, even though there are available cheap options to build a washing station.
However, a modest washing rate could also be caused by a habit that is encirced by soap or water’s loss.
Promosi and advocation to wash hands with soap can affect basic decisions, increase awareness of the effects of washing hands and bring to a long-term behavior change of population.
For this thing to work effective, it needs to be monitored and judgment.
The systematact check on 70 studies found the approach based on the community to improve the handwashing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of washing hands at school is "Blance of Stars" by UNICEP which deactivated the school to take easy and cheap steps to make sure the students wash their hands with the sabun, between other clean conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to the end of three stars,
Building a washing station can be part of the production campaign to wash the hands performed to reduce disease and death.

Excess of wash hands for human health – especially for people in the condition of a child or a soldier who has just given birth to a child or a baby — first known in the mid--19th century of a cleaned pioneer: doctor of Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, "The modern engineering engineering".
At that time, most people were still trusting that infection was caused by the smell of smell called nasmas.
In the 1980s, food and infections were related to health care, causing the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of the U.S. to promote the hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandic in 2020 brought to an upgrade in many countries about washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such disease.

The danger control of work on COVID-19
The danger control of the work to COVID-19 is an application for health and security for the risk control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
A real danger control at work depends on work and jobwork, based on risk consideration for the dissenting sources, the disease in the community, and the risk of any workers that might be exposed to CVID-19.
According to the Security administration and Health of the A.S. (OSHA), work with a low risk of discretion has a minimum contact with public and other employees, which are basic evacuating measures, including washing hands, encourage workers to sit in the house if they're sick, and keep a routine of breathing, and maintain a routine and hypothematical condition at work.
A simple scheduled risks include jobs that require a regular contact or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected have CVID-19, but it may have been infected because of the contact in the community that is currently happening or international travel.
This includes the workers who have contact with public people like in school, work environments with high population density, and some runcit environments with high volumes.
Violence control for this group, instead of the basic jangchiativity measures include air filters with highness, constraint guards, and have self-produce equipment if it connects with people who are infected by CVID-19.
OSHA considers a health care worker and a corpse home exposed to a known or suspected CVID-19 as the risk of higher dissenting, which is increasing to a very high risk of dispersion if the workers are doing the aerosole procedure on, or collecting or handling the spesimen of known or suspecting the CVID-19.
A dangerous control for these workers including engineering controls like a ventilation room with negative pressure and self-defending equipment that fit to work.
Cbak COVID-19 can have some effects in work.
Such work may not be an opportunity to attend because of illness, be at first assigned to care for someone else or to fear someone else.
The trade Pola may change, either of the property requested, and how to get this stuff (like shopping outside the top time or through the past delivery service).
Finally, the shipment of a dangerous geographic area continues by CVID-19 may be disturbed.
Relicating risk risks associated with various jobs and jobs, including the resources of exposure, the riskal risks that arise from the environment and community, and the risk of any workers like old age or chronic medical condition.
It also calls for control to overcome the risk, and the constant plan for situations that may have been caused by a plague.
Employment and responses of disease may be subjected to national rainbows or substantial.
Objectives to respond to the outbreak include cutting down the impulsion within the staff, protecting high - risked people to composure bad health, maintain business operations, and minimizing the bad effects of other entities in their supply chain.
The condition of illness in the community has been affected by the business response.
Violence control prevents are commonly used in security and employment health to exploit the risk control of silence.
When COVID-19 can't be lost, the most effective control of engineering, followed by administration control, and the last one is self-defension equipment.
kejuruteraan control involves the worker's investigation from the danger of the work without depending on the work behavior of the worker, and can be the most effective solution to be done.
administration control is a change in the base of work or procedures that require a worker or employer action.
The protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administration but can help prevent some disciplining.
All types of PPE must be selected according to danger to workers, installed correctly according to the harmony (cth respirator), used correctly, regularly checked, protected and replaced, if necessary, and rightly suspended, cleaned and saved or removed to avoid marriage.
According to the A.S. Security administration and Health (OSHA), it has lower risk risks to have a minimum contact with public and others.
The basic jangtinenity step that is recommended for all jobs including washing hands regularly and well, encourage workers to sit at home if they're sick, respirator ethic ethics include closing when the rock and pecks, prepare for workworks or turn when necessary, and don't encourage workers to use other tools or equipment, and keep the routine to work.
The identification and recognition of the individual potential potentially potentially potential is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
Control Center and Prevention of the A.S. (C.S.) is suggesting that the workers who have a customary ceramics sitting in the house until they are free of fever, other fever or symptoms without using a cure to reduce the other fever or symptoms, and the basic medical leave, allowing the workers to sit in the home of the sick family, and know this basic workers.
According to OSHA, a simple scheduled job includes a work that requires a regular contact in six feet (1.8 m) from people who are unknown or suspected by CARS-CoV-2 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to a commerition that is happening around the business location, or because these individuals have recently made an international trip to the most widely COV-19.
This includes the company who have contact with civilized people, such as at school, working environments with high population density and high - ranking environments. The engineering Control for these groups and risky risks include putting water filters at high rates, raising physical weights, and installing physical barriers, and installing physical barriers, and installing windows for client services, which include intervenancies that work in order to make it hard to keep, in order to diseaveling people, in order to be more comfortable, not to be able to support, to get their current workers, to support, and to be able to support, and to get more physically, and to use more practical training, to support, to the artwork, and to provide more practical training, to help, to support, and to provide more practical training, to support, and to the ability, and to get more important work, and to get more important, to get more important, and to the research, and to get more important, asy, and to the research, and to get involved.
Workers in this risk group are rare to use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, the correct control of the work and the other passengers including removing the sick person from a distance of 6 feet, assigned a krew to care for the sick, and gave a mask to the sick or to ask the sick to close his mouth and nose when he's rock or skin.
The cabin Creeks need to use medical gloves once while caring for a sick traveler or touching a potentially monstrous body or surfaces, and perhaps an extra protection equipment if the sick traveler has a fever or a constant struggle breathing.
The gloves and other items need to be removed in biobahaya bags, and the polluted surfaces need to be cleared and unconnected after that.
As soon as the medical milk was required to be made in a private cabin, for school and child care facility, CDC recommends a short term to clean or eliminate a quantity if the infected person had been in the school without counting the community.
When there is a minimum collaboration that is simple, social distance strategy can be applied like cancelling field visits, assemblies and meetings like physical education and choir class in the cafeteria, adding space between the table, the time came and the back of the crowd, limiting the visitor is not important, and using a separate health site for children with a flutom.
When there's a highular expression in local community, instead of social distance strategy, the further displacement of school is considered. The CDC considers the risk of the array health for members of the routine activities that are low.
The law enforcement officer who must have made contact with the person who was confirmed or suspected has CVID-19 recommended to follow the same guide line as the emergency medical technicians including the right protection equipment.
If a close contact occurs during the arrest, the workers need to keep their belts and task equipment off before using back with a reinstatement or smearing of the house, and following standard operation procedures for the PPE maintenance and repairs that are used and to clean and to wash the clothes.
OSHA considers the health care workers and the morgues are in a high or high category for the risk of exposure.
High - risked jobs include health care presentations, supportive labs and medical transportation personnel that are exposed to COVID-19’s well - known or suspected patients.
It's a very high-deed risk if the workers do aerosol income procedures on, or collecting or controlling the spesiment of the CVID-19 patients known or suspected.
Aerosol production procedures include intubs, collency procedures, bronkoscopei, some procedures and allegations, or invasive spesiment groups.
The job of a high displacement risking including the workers involved in providing a body of known people or suspecting the CVID-19 case in the time of their death; it is a very high risk of dispersion if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering control for these risks include the awareness room for the CVID-19 patients, including the result procedures of an aol.
Engaging with special negative pressure may fit in some of the health and morgues.
Spesiment needs to be handled by the supervisor of 3 Bioke safe levels.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that patients will be separated to a different waiting place depending on whether they are the COVD-19 case. However, OSHA recommends the respirator of those who work in 6 feet of known patients, or suspected, infected SARS-V-2, and they do the procedures of the corruption.
In the United States, the N95 - filter respirators that are approved by NIOSH or better have to be used in the context of the thorough breathing and writing including fit test, exercise and medical exams.
Other kind of respirators can provide a higher cover and increase the construction of the workers. WHO does not recommend the cover because COVD-19 is a breathing disease that does not spread through the liquid body.
WHO recommends only the operating mask for the entrance check staff.
For those who collect breathing spesiment from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol produce procedure, WHO recommends surgery masks, eyeguards, or face covers, armor and hand sarunges.
If the aerosol income procedure is done, the operating mask is replaced by N95 or the FFP2 respirator.
Since the global PPE supply is not enough, WHO recommends to minimize the needs of PPE through teleperubment, physical barriers like a clear window, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter CVID-19 patients, using only PPE that need to do a specific task, continue using the same respirator without taking care of it while taking care of many patients with the same diagnosis, and monitoring the PPE chain, and the supply supply supply supply not for individual use.

SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Rendering burden and ready for future
TARIKH/MASA HANTAR: 14 Mac 2020, 00:24 UTC
ESCENCE: CC0: No rights preserved
We found ourselves in a very incredible state of this month.
Epidemik CVID-19 is something that upsets us in the world and the responsibility we have against each other becomes clear.
We don't have any challenges like this before, but we know that our best responses depend on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community construction in the middle of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our fellow workers through e-mails, the phones and rations are incredible for the extraordinary human beings we're lucky enough to work together.
I'm so grateful and proud of being your workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of what the world means now when it's referring to Wikipedia, and how much it becomes a powerful symbol because this critical source stays online and is available to all.
Your work makes all this possible, whether you make sure your website remains active or your workmate paid or our community survived.
The world needs more information available by Wikipedia, over now.
It's a moment that's not what we do but how we do it, it's gonna mean to the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some significant adjustments about how we work, starting next week.
Synchronization to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the day and the moon will come.
In that discussion, we consider what we think is going to be the response to what we're dealing with and the best way to make sure that this organization can survive at this time.
Together, we want to remove stress and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to slow down a little, it's okay.
To all staffs, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily jobs will be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours per week until they come to know.
We don't announce vacation-- if you can work at the usual time, the mission can use you.
However, the world is now unrealable, whether you need to care for a loved person, buy a kitchen or meet our doctor, your well-before.
We won't write your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't be told, but we told him.
No need for days ill or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team to recheck the calendar and schedule to make sure that the main work is covered.
(I guess you're diagnosed positive COVID-19, informing Bryan in T congregationC Ops to help with support and make sure that your situation is given the exact attention to the management side).
Those who are paid according to the hour will be paid full.
We've already told and insisted commitments to respect our contractors' commitments and staff workers paid by hours.
Each person will be paid according to their normal hours of work.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we're doing can be so satisfying us, especially in these times.
Again, this is about your care.
We're just asking you to communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and get to adjust it directly.
Some jobs are considered important.
There are things we must keep going.
The SRE team, HR Ops, Amanah & Security, and Dana Recognition (in between them) doing critical work that might need additional help.
We're going to start a process with all the departments to examine the current objectivity and move our focus to support what matters for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just gonna focus on the most important project.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We don't plan to move twice to pursue what's left" as soon as this pandemik went.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet the current nonrestinal date.
We admitted that things have changed, will we try to set targets and new lines if necessary.
What happened with APP (Memorial Plant)?
To adjust to real reality and our daily working hours, we want to adjust our 2020-2021 presentation presentation.
Our desire to recommend the plans of 2019-2020, which allows more time to buy workers to give priority to their secular work, to care for themselves and to care for their loved ones while helping them to need or to work for a few weeks to come.
Timelines exceeded much of the work and pressures of plans throughout the organization.
We'll introduce our suggestions to the Lembaga next week and inform the representatives and troops of the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team on your safety in this.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our fellow fellow fellow SF might be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a careful step, we've hired a cleanup team to uncover all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use hospital gred solutions to uncover every surface and lobi and elevator system that reaches our level.
This building received its own caret protocol using a product that supports the safety of the tenants.
We felt at ease that the office would be available very well when we decided to return.
Our DC's office is located in WeWork, who shares the COVD-19 protocol with us and all the staff's hazarded in DC.
In the past week, our DC's office switched to a remote supply completely paralleled with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of the colleagues were known in NYC, we're also talking about the discovery of one location in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues but may be late.
Some of our fellow workers were working hundreds of miles away for the first time.
Workmates long ago we knew that it could be a adjustment and want to give you some advice:
Restrict the meeting period for the older one or two hours.
If a session is longer needed, consider how it can be divided for a few days.
Determines the meeting clearly, has the agenda and send the literature first.
Makes the default video, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to simplify the collaboration and direct connections.
Have a leader to control every meeting, someone to monitor buals for questions and track the speakers, and someone helps to take notes (or do notes collaborationly).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headline.
Use your spare payments for light food.
Join the #remoties in Slack to talk to your colleagues about assigned tasks
The HR Operation team is looking at the ergonomic Webinar guide to support the increase in the task that is distributed to the entire Foundation.
Since the last few weeks we've been asking all community receptions to cancel the public event that Wikimedia was financed by Wikimedia, like editaton so that WHO announced the end of the pandemik.
We told them that we understood our request for renouncing and other partitions could be something impossible to prepare the activities that were approved by them and that none would be punished for delaying or modifying that goal.
In the next week, we'll make milk with additional guide about Wikimania and other region community and themeity trial.
The common Sentimen of all global communitys seems to be a sadness on the disorder but feel relieved at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and the opposite.
Forwarded forward, CRT tried to wake up a page about Meta-Wiki to provide room to community to monitor our imposter and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch about COVID-19's related issues
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special personnel meeting.
We're going to use this time to share additional pack now, answer your questions and spend some time in contact with each other.
We're together in this and we're here to help as far as we can.
For now, you can keep looking for information from this email, and all information related to COVID-19 other important information at the Wiki Office.
CRT will ensure that all this pages are updated and all information are at one place.
We also strive to make sure that regular communications with staffs in the country are very impressed at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, event, a primary flow of work, or a liputan challenge, or any help you need, do not hesitate to check and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help in providing support and to be a securer if needed.
If you have a hard or sensitive matter, please e-mail to Bryan Judahn - Director of International Operation HR.
There's nothing this change to be seen as our work and our responsibility.
But all of these are recognitions at this time, our work and our responsibility may have to be adjusted in a way that's not the past.
These are the steps that we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue working, provide our movements with the support they need, and the world services that they can expect.
Our designer will be there to wait for us in the day when the end is near.
For now, it's when it's time to support each other and create space for an important task to arrive in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need you all to make it real, and we need you all to take care of yourself and the family so that you will be ready at the best stage when that needs arrive.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

The human version of enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensionerer 2 is azink that contains metaloenzime is located on the endotellium surface and other cells.
ACE2 Protein contains domains M2 peptidase N-terminals and the amino amino amino amino rleidentin C-terminal.
ACE2 is a protein membrane of a single path, with its enzyme domain is actively distributed on the surface of the cell in other lungs and tissues.
ACE2 cell domains are attached from the transmembrant domains known by other enzims as sheddases, and the resulting proteins are released into the blood flow and finally put them into urin.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 bars at most of the cell membranes of alveolus both lungs, small societs, artites and cell endothelium vena and the gentle muscle cells in most organs.
The mRNA ACE2 experiment also found in the crebrum corteks, stiatum, hipotalamus and brain trunks.
ACE2's primary function is to act as ambang to ACE.
ACE sticks the hormone I angiotension into an angiotensional cup of angiotension II.
ACE2 is sticking the amino-terminal asboksil-terminal of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrotensions it into agiotension of vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tle-H-H-Tle-He-Pro-H).
ACE2 can also stick a number of other peptidas including [des-Arg9]- bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 is also controlling the membrane of the sLC6A19 amino amino amino neutral acids and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As transmembrant proteins, ACE2 acts as the primary entry center into the cell for some koronavirus including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus due to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the result of CVID-19).
Especially, bindings for the S1 proteins of thepaid SARS-CoV-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 proteins on the ACE2 domain on the cell interface cause the endostosis and the transmission of the virus and the enzyme to the endosom is located between cells.
The entry process also requires S protein stopping by the TMPRS2 host seriesing protest, perpendure under the current study as potentially attached. This has caused some to make hypothesis that reduce the ACE2 level in the cell might help against the stroke.
However, a variety of professional groups and cell controls are recommending to continue the standard ACE account and ARB therapy.
The systematact and meta analysis are published on July 11, 2012, found that "ACE accounting user is associated with a large 34% increase in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced to patients who are treated with the ACE account which have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially they with strokes and heart failures.
The use of the ACE is also associated with reduction in pneumonia related rates, even though his decision is less mantap than the whole risk of pneumonia."
The human rejoinment of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered as novel therapy for the lung injury, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodinak and the oxygen in the pig's son with the veres respiratory lipopolisida.
A half of the lives of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes as additional in the effects (tempoh) for 24 hours.
Some discoveries suggest that rhACE2 can be a drug that can be expected for them with the inlerant of the classic angiotension renient system, or in the disease that surrounds angiotension II was enhanced. The rhACE2 infusi's research for the medical treatments are restresed.
The application of b'COVD-19 is a mobile software application designed to help the contact as response to the coronavirus pandecarus 2019-20, which is the process of identifying people " related") they may connect to individuals who are infected.
Many applications are built or charged with government officials supporting in some areas and in power.
Some jobs to build the contact update application have been built.
The privacy balance is loaded, especially about the system based on the user's geographic location.
Alternative less interrupting including Bluetooth signal use to record user proxymiti log on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would unite functionality to support Bluetooth applications directly into the Android's operation system and iOS.
In China, China's government, collision with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they ever had a relationship with those who were infected by COVID-19.
It's used throughout 200 cities in China in Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was built by local IT community, launched as an open source and will be passed to the government. North Macedonia launchs "StopKorona", an application based on Bluetooth to tracking up with a potentially infected person and giving an immediate response to the medical government.
The application was built by communication and Technology and Health Ministry.
By April 14, 2020, an application is waiting for a graduation by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the projection application was on an extended development level, and it was available to launch in a few weeks. An same application was designed in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand considers an application based on TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. The Russians want to introduce geobtop applications to patients that are diagnosed with CVID-19 who live in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listing a number of practical problems that are potential to the application, including positively and potential lack of success if an implementation is limited to only a small part of the population.
Controls the concerns of "cooronavirus" applications that are confused or dangerous, Apple sets the limit for types of organizations that can add the corresponding applications to its Apps Store, limiting them to the "power only" or organization named.
Google and Amazon have run the same partition.
The private campaign campaigns expressed their concerns about the effect of the mass surveillance using the koronavirus application, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure is created to handle the coronavirus's concrete would be stopped as soon as the threat is passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have made the fact that they're asking for a limit of surveillance like this.
Organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
Controls must be "in legal terms, if necessary and merely,"
Further monitor and surveillance should have the klausa set;
use of data should be limited to COVD-19's purposes;
data and recognition security should be protected and shown as protected by evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid damageing discrimination and marginalization;
any data share with the third party should be defined in the law;
Keep protected against abuse and citizen rights to respond to abuse;
Alibacy means that all "fixed sides" should be necessary, including public health experts and a handful group. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also removes the check list.
Google/Apple plans wish to handle an ongoing surveillance problem by removing the projection mechanism from their device's operating system as soon as it doesn't need to be needed.
Some countries use the location based on a network instead of an application, removing both necessary needs to download the application and the ability to avoid misfortune.
In Israel, audition based on networks.
A network that has access to raw location data has a great potential privacy problem.
However, not all systems with the focus server need to have access to private location data; a number of privacy maintenance systems have been created using the focus server only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, one system based on an application used to create a relationshipjack.
Instead of using special applications, system collecting information from various sources including mobile device removal data and card transaction data, and join this all generated notice through the text message to individual potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn the potential contact, the government also makes the location information available for public, something allowed because of a major change in the information law after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to people through a number of aplictions and websites. The countries include Germans considering the system of priorities and privacy.
Sixth April 2020, details have not been broadcasted yet.
Emergency contact with privacy maintenance is the concept that is recommended by body study literature began since 2013. Set up 7 April 2020, over as well as a group of experts working for privacy solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Bluetooth energy (BLE) to log the user proxymiti on other cellular phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination endeavor that contains a central and intersect, and not a single protocol. The protocol is included the Privacy Prevention of Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Service Number (CN, CEN, Contact Number, Privation and Privation Protocol).
In this protocol, known private data never leaves the device, and all the matchings occur on the device.
The Lab Media MIT group is waking SafePaths, one platform to use privacy maintenance techniques when collecting and using locations or data to trace CVID-19.
This is based on the study of the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: maintain Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The same thing is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a private development company based on the MIT Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share the sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without endangering data privacy.
On April 5th 2020, global TCN Coalition was established by some groups that were united about the same method and a large overlapping protocol, with the goal to reduce the impact of the partition, and to operate global global operation and warning alert, an important aspect to reach the widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had already made an open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by the official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS platforms, announces one initiative for the contact that they claim to keep privacy, based on one lower Bluetooth energy combination and private cryptography.
They also publish the core technology specification used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the desire system to launch in three levels:
Tool launchs for allowing the government to create private management applications
Integration of this function directly into iOS and Android plans Google and Apple to deal with the problems of execution and surveillance continue before efficient the system through the current operating system, and then then remove it in the same way as the threat is passed.

nukleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fasa 1 and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (Fasa I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5)
As told by the CEPI scientists in April, a number of 115 candidates are in the early stage of development, by 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with a little public information available (i.e.e. to design or being created).
The Fasa I-II test the early security test and the regent, usually randomly, controld and multiple sites, while it determines the dos work more correctly.
III stage trials usually involve more impairment including control groups and tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for negative effects on optimal dos.

Broadcasts on social media encourage conspiration theory that claim a virus behind COVID-19 have been known and one vaccine is already available.
The Patens that are distributed by many social media broadcasts refer to existing patenes for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus forces such as SARS coronavirus.
The disease of b'Koronavirus 2019 (COVD-19) is a infection disease because of the concrete syndrome coronavius 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The regular tejalas include fever, coughs and breaths.
Another crowd may include the tiredness, the muscle pain, the direa, the sick of the throats, missing the smell and the abdomen disease.
The time has been set up until the first of a five days is usually set up between two and twelve days.
While the major cases cause light symptoms, some go forth to become virus pneumonia and multiple organ failures.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported throughout 210 countries and region, causing more than 153,000 death.
More than 568,000 patients have been recovered, and this virus especially spread among humans when close to the relationship, it's always made by small typhoons produced by rock, snucks or talk.
While these titis are produced in the breath, it usually falls to the ground or on the surface rather than being jangchant for a distance.
They too can be infected by touching their contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
Virus can stay on the surface until 72 hours.
At least after the first three days of symptoms, though the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and in the next disease level. The standard method of dignosis is with a transcripsi chain reaction to real time (cRT-PCR) from the nasofaringal swab.
The use of masks are recommended to those who suspect themselves carry their virus and their guards.
The trial for the use of masks by common public use is different, with some authorities recommend not using them, some recommend for it and others require their use.
At this time, no vaccine or a special virus treatment for CVID-19.
The local transfer of disease is recorded in most countries all six areas of WHO.
Those who are infected with virus may be aspirations or show symptoms like flus such as fever, rocks, exhaustion and breath.
Emergency-glows include breathing problems, pain or pressure continue, confusion, difficulty running and faces or lips; medical attention immediately prompted if these stigmas show up.
Less is the same, the top-party breathing ribbon, the watery nose or the abjection might be noticed.
The gastrous-gejala is like loya, puppling and diarea is noted in multiple percent.
Some cases in China at first show only data and celebrities.
In some cases, diseases may develop pneumonia, multiple organs and death failure.
It's called the tube period.
The period of inkubation for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but it may be between two and 14 days.
97.5% patients that show symptoms will do it in 11.5 days since the infection. Report shows that not all infected show symptoms.
This asstoran in this transfer is still unknown; however, the initial evidence suggests that it might contribute to the spread of disease.
The infections of those who are infected do not show the symptoms of the time and are now reviewed, with the Korean Control and Prevention Center (KDC) reports that 20% of all cases that are confirmed to remain in their hospitals.
Chinese National Health Commissioner began to enter an automated case in their daily cases on April 1; from 166 efficient on that day, 130 (78%) is an aspiration at test time.
Kahak and muddy can carry a lot of virus loads.
A strong talk releases more tits than talking normally.
One study in Singapore found that a cough could not shut up your mouth, causing a ties to move until 4.5 metres (15 m).
Although the virus is not by means, the Sains National Academy suggests that bioarosol transfers are likely and the air collision in the hallway outside the room shows a positive sample for the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubulation and cardiopulmonary respiratory (CPR) may cause respiration to be an aerosol and so on.
Though there is a fear that it spreads through the tinja, this risk is believed low, the virus is very contagious when the impostory person; even though the spread is possible before the signs, the risk is low.
The European Center for Prevention and Control Disease mentioned even if the whole thing was not clear about the mudah spread, a person spread two to three commonly, the virus lasted for a few hours until a few days on the surface.
Especially, the virus was found to be detected for a day on a cardbod, so three days on plastic (polipropilena) and the rustic revers (AISI 304), and until four hours over 99% copper.
But this is different from the intensity and temperatures.
Sabun and detergen are also useful if used properly; soap products weaken the layer of virus fat protection, deactivate it and release it from other skins and surfaces.
Other Lautans are like cloridas and cloricesdina glunats (disable operational infections) are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, this was taken for median for two days after the beginning of the hospital entry.
In five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus burden, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus burden on the second day tested.
The cosonavius syndrome of bad respiration 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bad coronavirus syndrome novel, first separated from three people with pneumonia related to the conspiration of the respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All of the aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virus novels have been related to the coronavirus.
Out of the human body, the virus was killed by the soap of the house, that puts its protective bubbles, SARS-CoV-2 almost associated with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVD-19 because the virus accesss the host cell through angiotensin enzyme enzyme (ACE2), the most much in the alveolus cells of the II types of lungs.
Virus uses glikoprotein special surfaces called "plomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
The quant clerium clerium was found in 12% people who were infected to the hospital in Wuhan, China and more often in a terrible disease.
High cardiovaskular symptoms rates, due to systemic treatments and imuncient disease during the progress of disease, but quant miokardium damage may also be related to the ACE2 prescriptors in the heart.
ACE2's apartment is very much in the heart and involved in a heart function.
The level of trombosis (31%) and trombobolism vena (25%) found in an ICU patient with CVID-19 and might be associated with a weak prognosis. The autopsy of the world because CVID-19 has found the alveolus crash infus (DAD), and the limfosition of lysis contained in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicalme for ACE2 expression epitelial cells on breathing channels, patients with the bad CID-19 have systemic hiperacts.
Especially, the GM-CSF cell is shown to closures with monositing sections of IL-6 and the bad lung lung patology in CVID-19 patients.
The limfositic crash also reported during autopsy.
WHO published some testing protocols for disease.
The standard testibility method is the response to transcryption polimerase chain changes in real times (rPT-PCR).
The test is usually done on a breathing sample obtained with nasofaringeal swab; however, nose swab or kahak samples may also be used.
His decisions are commonly available within a few hours until two days.
The blood test can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks to do and his decision has a little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to separate the current forces and publish genetic sequences so that the whole world's labs can freeze a test of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to detect the infections by the virus.
At least four April 2020, an antibodi test (perhaps the active infection and either one has been infected in the past) is in development but is not used widely.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States reported the first security test in March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month, a diagnostic guide line was published by the Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan University suggested the method for celebrities based on clinical properties and the risk of epidemiology.
The glass opacity is broken when it comes to pictric, asimmetric and postterior is normal during early infections.
Dominans subpleura, a lot of turbulences (the closures with multiple alveolusisions) and the compatibility may appear when the disease progresses.
Some data can be found about monoscopeic lesi and CVID-19 patofisionology.
The main pathological finding during autopsy is:
Makroscope: pleury, pulmonari hystery, lung lungs and pulmonari edema
Four types of credentials for the virus pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonari edema, pneumosit, hiperplacia, large atipical pneumositical, space- between limfositic and multinukat cell formation
Bad pneumonia: an alveolus damage infus (DAD) with an exudat alveolus infus.
DAD is the cause of the distres respiratory abstracts and the bad hipoksemia.
Restoring pneumonia: exaggerator in alveolus and fibrosis space between pulmonari
Blood: intravaskular coagration spread (DDC), leukoeristroblatic designation
Preference steps to reduce the possibility of jangchity including living in the house, avoid people, often wash hands with soaps and water and for at least 20 seconds, practice good breathing clean and avoid touching eyes, nose or mouths with untruth hands.
The CDC recommends to close your mouth and nose with a tisu when a cough or sling and suggesting the use of the part in the shoulder if there is no papers.
The proper hands are clean after any coughs or encouraged.
CDC recommends the use of kain covers in the public area, some of it to limit transfers by the individual asimpomatic. The social prison strategy is intended to reduce relationships that are infected by the large group through the school cover and at work, limiting the trip and cancel large public assembly.
The prison lines also include people who are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There are no known drugs as effective to prevent CVID-19. Because the vaccine is not expected until the beginning of 2021, the main thing in the CVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemik peak, known as "maginize the tyranny".
The CDC also suggested that individuals often wash their hands with soaps and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating or after cutting the noses, coughs or sling.
It's suggested to use the hands based on at least 60% alcohol but only when soap and water are not available.
In this exercise, an antimikrob activity appears from ethanol or isopropanol.
The condrogen peroxide is used to help rid the bacterian spora in alcohol; it's not active material for the anticipation of the hand.
Glaiserol added as a driver.
With the help of others, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and support other important organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves brings a virus to wear a simple face mask.
escactorporeum membrane (ECMO) is used to handle breathing failure issues, but the advantage is still under consideration.
Personal cleaning and healthy lifestyle and diet is recommended to improve imunition.
Support treatment may be useful for them with light symptoms at the early stage of infection.
Critical caregivers and pulmonology experts in the U.S. are collecting medical recommendations from various agencys as free source, IBCC.
By April 2020, there's no special treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of theprofen mother for the use of the first line.
Be careful step should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transfers, especially in health care settings when running procedures that can generate an aerosol, such as intubting or handracy.
For medical care professionals to keep those who are infected by COVD-19, CDC recommends to put the person in the Sicking Room (AIR) as an extra in using the standard berjaga-jaga step, the step of contact and alert steps. The CDC provides a guide line for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during the pandemith.
The recommendations are: PPE dress, respirators or face masks, eyeguards and medical gloves. If available, respirators (before face mask) are preferred.
Repirator N95 passed by industrial settings but FDA has already allowed masks to be used under the Truth of Kecemasan Use (EUA).
It's designed to protect from transport particles such as booc but it's effective to special biological agents are not secure for the use of the outside label.
When the mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of face armor or as the final option, the artificial mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are bad so that it requires mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percent needed it.
The type of breathing support for individuals with CVID-19 is related to breathing failures is active to patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubtation can be avoided with high-level nose lenses or positive air channel pressure two stages.
Whether these both benefits to people who are sick of critical are unknown.
Some doctors choose to stay with an invasive mechanical ventilation if it has been found that this technique restricted the spread of aerosol particles rather than the high flow could be found in the form of an older age (they are especially older than 60 years old and especially those who are more than 80 years old).
Many countries built not enough hospital beds per crab, which limited the medical system’s capacity to control a sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases need enough hospital entrys.
A study in China found that a 5% held into a rapid care unit, 2.3% requires ventilator and 1.4% support.
In China, at least 30% patients in the hospital with COVD-19 will be put to ICU at the end.
The mechanical Ventilation has become more complicated because the genetics restres respiratory respiratory (OVID-19) built in CVID-19 and the pharmacy is getting more difficult.
The Ventilator is able to control pressure and PEEP is required to film oxygen presentation while minimizing the risk of lung injury related to ventilators and pneumotors.
High PEP may not be available on older ventilators.
The research for potential treatment begins in January 2020, and a couple of studies are in clinical tests.
Redesivir appears to be the most expected.
Although the new drugs may take the time 2021 to build, some drugs are being tested for other uses are already in further tests.
The obsolete may be tested by many who have a severe disease.
Who recommends volunteers take part in a potential and potential medical attempt, a FDA gives the truth while for the recovery of the plasma as an experimental treatment in cases for their serious or easy life.
It's not yet through the medical research to show it safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched an easy application to cope with a disease plague.
User requested to enter their name and ID.
This application can detect 'expected' using surveillance data and with that risk of potential infections.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potentially detected, applications are not only recommending their own quarantine, they also warn local health authorities. Big data analysis on cellular phone data, face recognition technology, mobile phones and researching are used to track people who are infected and those they communicated in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israel government allowed safety agencies to track down their mobile phone data from the coronavirus.
Step is taken to control quarantine and protect those who have contact with infected citizens.
Also, in March 2020, Ulche Telekom shares the data of agregate phone location with the German government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to diagnose and prevent virus spread.
The Russians run the face recognition technology to detect quarantine's fault.
The commissioner of Italy Giulio Gallera said he was told by the mobile phone handler that "40% people keep moving everywhere."
The German government runs hackathon weekends 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Also President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid calls to global solutions to coronavirus.
People may experience pressure caused by quarantine, travel barriers, or even fear of the efficientation.
The 19th of the C.E. quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Encidenting, loneliness, health anxiety, pressure and economic disorders are thousands of perfect health that endanger people’s mental health and well-being."
Diseases will cause light effects with a little or no symptoms, such as the normal neurotical respiratory disease.
ringanness often heals in two weeks, while they are with severe diseases or critics, they take three or six weeks to heal.
A pregnant woman may have a high risk of getting a bad CVID-19 clutches based on data from the same virus as SARS and MERS, but data for CIVD-19 is less.
In most of them are affected, COVID-19 can quickly be an instres respirator respirator (ARDS) causing respirator failures, shocks or multiple organ failures.
Communciation is related to COVID-19 including a disability, unnormal abuse and damage to the heart, waist and heart fruit.
Unusual treatment, especially the increase in protrombin time, has been evident in a number of 6% of those who are put into the hospital with CVID-19, while the pinggang function is not normal in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% people who are infected by CVID-19 show the increase of the heart enzimsamination.
According to the same report, median times between the beginning of symptoms and death are ten days, with five days spent for hospital entrys.
However, the patient was transferred to ICU had the median time for seven days between the hospital entry and death.
In early cases study, median times of early symptoms so death is 14 days, with the cover of six to 41 days.
In one study by the National Health Commissioner (NHC) China, men have a rate of death over 2.8% while women with a rate of death 1.7%.
Hertopatology check on post-mortem lung samples show a monk of alveolus damage with exfrice cellular fibromisoid in both lungs.
The change of the virus is noted in pneumosit.
The lung images show the lung respirator respirator.
In 11.8% death was reported by the Chinese National Health Commissioner, a heart damage was observed with the increase of astroponin or kardium is stopped.
According to Mac's month Mac from the United States, 89% of those put in the hospital with health conditions available, medical resources and regional sociotype may also affect the rate of death.
As a result of death rates from different circumstances because of the difference of their territory, but also because of the difficulty of metodology.
A light case under case can cause more estimates for death rates.
However, the fact that death is caused by an infection case at the past can mean the rate of death in less estimates.
Smokers have 1.4 times more likely to have a bad symptoms of CVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely need care or die than that is not smoking.
The Hong Kong Hospitals have found 20% down to 30% in the lung ability in some patients who are cured from disease, and lung scans suggest organ damages.
This may also lead to the syndrome after the rapid care of recovery.
As far as March 2020, it's not known if the infection was before giving the imunition is effective and long term in the sick of this disease.
Imunity is seen as possible, according to other coronavirus conduct, but in the case of the recovery of CVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for the coronavirus on a date that was reported.
All this case is believed to be worse with long - term infections than remark.
Virus is remarked to be and comes from animals, through abundant infections.
The real origin is not known but until December 2019 of the entire cordion is almost all over it was packed through the transfers of human beings to mankind.
A study for the first 41 cases of CVID-19 was confirmed, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, exposeing the initial date of the symptoms was on December 1 December 2019.
The official Publishing of the WHO reported the beginning of the symptoms is on December 8, 2019.
Some steps are used to measure death rates.
These numbers differ from areas and by the number of time and are affected by the number of tests, health care quality, treatment options, period since early and population properties such as age, body and health.
At the end of 2019, WHO sets the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infection that confirms the lab and U07.2 death of the SARS-CoV-2 infection without a clinical or epideology.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death over global cases is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) is equal to 17 April 2020.
The number is different from the area. Other steps include the death rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of the person who has been diagnosed from disease, and the rate of infections that reflected the percent of the infected individuals.
This statistics are not limited in time and are subjected to certain populations of infections until the solution of the case.
While not everyone wakes antibodi, antibodi's presence may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the base of the plague in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
In Gangelt, disease was spread by Carnival party, andular to younger people, causing a lower death rate in comparison, and not all the CVID-19 death is officially distributed.
In addition, the German health system is not overly overweited.
In the Dutch, at least 3% may have an antibodi as worth of blood.
69 (0.004% population) was confirmed by the COVID-19.
The pandemic and the death rate is different for men and women.
The death rate is higher for a man in the study runs in China and Italy.
The highest Risiko for a man is they're in 50s, with a barrier between a man and a woman is merely at 90 years old.
In China, death rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The real reason for the difference of this sex is unknown but genetic factors and conduct may be a reason.
The imunological differences of sex, a lack of smoke in women and men form morbid conditions together like a hipertension in younger than women may be able to contribute to a higher death rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals are males and 72% of the world’s population because the COVID-19 was a man.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track the data of sex for CVID-19's infection.
Research indicates that blue disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, had a difference between men and women.
Percentage of health workers, particularly the nurse, was a woman, and they had higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that C shortage for korona, the VI for the virus, D for disease and 19 for the first time the outbreak would be known: 31 December 2019.
The name is selected to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e. China), species of animals or groups, according to international cosyoans to offer the name to avoid stigma. The virus that causes CVD-19 named the coronavirust respiration of 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Additionally that WHO uses "COVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19) in public communication.
Both diseases and viruss usually refer to as "conoronavirus".
When the initial expression in Wuhan, China, viruss and diseases are commonly reference to the "cononavirus" and "cononavirus Wuhan".
On January 2020, WHO recommends 2019-nCov's denomination and a 2019-nCoV respiration disease as a temporary name for the virus and disease according to the 2015 guide to the use of location for disease and virus names.
The official name of CVD-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is announced on February 11, 2020.
Because of the capacity limit in the standard supply chain, some digital intersects brought out health caret materials such as noses and ventilators.
In one example, when Italian hospitals need a ventilator quickly, and providers can't send it in a time scale needed, a new engineering turned local and produce 100 of the ventures that are necessary all night.
After the early COVID-19, conspiration theory, false information and untrue information appears to be the origin of diul, scales, controlment, treatments and other aspects of disease and spread online online quickly.
Human ability to spread a virus to some other animals.
A study failed to find evidence of a virus copy in a cohizir, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are passed to treat illnesses.
International investigations about vaccines and CVID-19 are being developed by governmental organizations, academy groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began "Discounting SOLIDARY" to examine the effects of the four-thirteenth treatments of the most expected.
No vaccines can be found but many agencys are waking up the vaccine candidates actively.
Previously on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 used a ACE2 recipe to enter the human cell.
There are three malfunctional strategys on the street.
First, researchers target to build a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus about either being active or dead, is intended to get an immediate action in the human body against a new infection with CVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is intended to create a sensitive vaccine with the imuncient system on some subunit virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research is focused on Spaku proteins that help the virus to break the ACE2 prescriptor.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine. (Vaksin DNA or RNA, novel technique to create a copy.)
The experiment of any of these strategies need to be tested for security and success on March 16, 2020, the first clinical attempt began with four volunteers in Arkansas.
The Vactionn contains a dangerous genetic code copied from a virus that causes a disease. The anti-bodi dependencies are recommended as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a controversit.
There are over 300 active clinical trials being run by April 2020.
Seven trials have been passed as treatments for malaria, including four studies above hydroksichoquine or chloroquine.
The change of the purpose covered most of the Chinese investigation, with nine experiments of fasa III to the brakes for some countries need to be reported by the end of April.
A clinical developmental development check for CVID-19 vaccines and medicine candidates are available, as well as April 2020. Some current medications are being judged for CVID-19, including the brakes, chloroquine and hydroxacloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir are joining with my interferonistonator.
There's evidence of the compatible evidence for the effect of the brakedevir set by Mach 2020.
clinical growth is noted in patients who are treated with a loving redesivir use.
The trial of the Fasa III clinical is done in the United States, China and Italy, was used to treat malaria before this was held in China in February 2020, making the decision early.
Anyway, there's a call for re-examination review.
Korean and Chin are recommending chloroquine users.
However, Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending daily dos as a gram, admit that double dos are very dangerous and can carry death.
On March 28, 2020, FDA published an emergency use for hidroksichloquine and chloroquine by medical talk of the COVID-19. The title of the 7 Chinese also included interferon, laptopvirin or umifenovir to use against CVID-19.
The early data shows that high laptopvirin dos is necessary to paint SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazo Peride recommended for further in vivo research after showing the lower intensity of SARS-CoV-2. A study indicates that early protein completion by the transmembrance series (TMPRS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through the interaction of ACE2 recipe.
The chloroquine and hydroksichloroquine together or without azithromycin has a major limit that prevents the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not match SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and no role in CVD-19 treatment.
The satokin storm can be a compilation in the next stage for the worst COVID-19.
There's evidence that hydroksichloroquine has the properties of antistokin's storm, Tocilizumab has been put in the control line by the Chinese National Health Commissioner after a small research was completed.
It's working on a non-deditional test at the national level in Italy after showing a positive decision with a terrible disease.
Joined with a serum feritin blood test to identify a storm of hookin, this means to fight the development, which was considered the cause of death for some infected people.
Antagonis interinctified by FDA based on retroptive cases research for the steroid refroctorian steroid steroid treatment was included by a different reason, CAR T.S.A. cell therapy in 2017.
Until now, there's no random evidence that tocilizumab is a effective treatment for CRS.
Moving antibodis are solid and sharpened by their imuncy system from the COVID-19 to people who need to be taken as non-existing vaccines to reflect.
This strategy is tried on SARS with no consultive results.
The neutralization of the virus is the mechanism of the action that the antibodi pasif therapy can be the defense between SARS-CoV-2.
Another mechanism, however, is like an antibodi and/or a bitorial artifact.
Another form of antibodiphif therapy, for example, using monoklon antibodi is produced in development.
Recognizing the recovery serum, which consisted of the blood liquid part of a recovery patient and contains special antibodies on this virus can increase for further execution.
Conronavirus disease, one of the closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor in Central Hospital of Wuhan, then infected and died by COVID-19 after a displacement of the virus.
