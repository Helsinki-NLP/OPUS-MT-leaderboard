In fact, the progressing of chronavirus illness (COVID-19) has increasing quickly in Europe/Wilayah Ekonomi Europe and Raya England, January 1,5 to March 2020.
In fact, the inflicial quantity of koronavirus disease (COVID-19) indicates that same strenues in the European Union/Wilayah Ekonomi Ekonomyan and Raya England who confirm that, though its stages are different, the COVIDOD-19 are rapidly developing in all nations.
Using Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase the preparation for CVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive treatments.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia case claster with etiologi was unknown to be reported at Wuhan, the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiongkok Disease Center and Prevention of the Tiongkok agents of the disease in which are now called new coronavirus syndrome koronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, illness has been affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections called koronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence until now indicates that some 80% of the CVID-19 suffers a light disease, which is a infection of breath with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers heal.
At some 14% cases, COVID-19 develops a more serious illness and requires hospital treatment, while 6% other cases are undergoing critical illnesses that require intensive treatment.
patient Mortality under hospitals due to CVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 COVID-19 countries of Europe/Wilayah Ekonomi Ekonomic Europe (EEEA) and England (UK) and compare it to the incident in the Hubei Province of Tiongkok.
Then we compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA and UK countries to the total number of cases in Italy for 31 January–15 March 2020.
COsus COVID-19 in the EU/EA and UK state
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has experienced a more remote Roman penyebaran and dynamic pandinas of COVID-19 on the other side of the world right now following the pandemi dynamic in Tiongkok.
Bidding on March 11, 2020, the Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) states CO. CO. VID-19 sebagai pandemi.
On Eurosurveillacy 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with COVD-19 cases based on the definition of WHO’s case.
IN EU/EA, three cases were first confirmed by France on January 24, 2020 on the return people from Wuhan, the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 case has been detected throughout 30 countries EU/EA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date included, 39.768 kes and 1.7277777, reported that, with 17.750 case and 1441 kematian from Italy alone.
Getting kumulatif numbers and quantitive incidents of COVD-19
THE number of European Disease Controls and Controls, the number of cases COVD-19 have been given every country in the world today to update only the official source of such as the Health of the state, national health and regional authorities, and individuals.
This data was used to evaluate COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK, and compare it to the tropn in Italy.
EU/EA and UK, in the period of January 1,–15 March 2020.
We also present the case quamulational number of cases that each country has been told to 15 March 2020 o'clock compared to Italian cases during January 31,–15Maret 2020.
TANPA-19 in EU/EA and UK state
In fact, the 14 COVID-19 case in the EU/EA and UK are following tropn in the Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Gambar 1).
EU/EA and UK secara keseluruhan, COVID-19’s quantimal incident began to rise about 21 February, and it grew sharp about February 28 February 2020 ( Tambahan support).
these Trens are especially moved by the fast increase of the case reported from Italy, but all other EU/EA countries and UK indicate that the increase of the CVID-19 COVIDUD-19 is similar in many countries.
Picture 2 menunjukkan bahawa the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UK countries are compared to the number of cumulatives in Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
The vehicle recorded that, until 15 Mac 800, 15 countries of other EU/EA and UK have reported a total of the case as well as a total of the Italian case before or less than that.
our results indicate that the total number of COVID-19 cases are increasing quickly in EU/EA and UK.
The Trequently noted in COVD-19’s quantity quantity quantified that the pandemis rose at the same rate in all nations.
This is far away from the differences of the countries that are experiencing, variations of society’s health responses, and possibly the difference of cases between countries and protocols to choose patients to be tested for the CVID-19 confirmation, which includes milking test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in Italy, often described the situation about 10% COVD-19 patients needed intensives and media resources to report that hospitals and medical care units in this area have reached the maximum capacity.
Today, COVID-19 case receive data in a hospital and/atau unit intensive treatments at EU/EA levels are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
But data should be gathered in a way that systematacts data to complete the current surveylan data, focused on the number of cases reported and death numbers.
The study conducted in 2010-2011 shows the variation of the availability of an intensive medical sleep and the intensive treatments in Europe, from 29,2 in Germany to 4,2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This article means that countries can have more resources or more than Italians (12,5 place to sleep intensive treatments and gila treatments per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
COVID 19 of the U.E. and UK UK related to the risk of >90% beyond the role of intensive treatment, provided in the sixth risk of ECVID-19 risks.
Because of this far - reaching case, the state of EU/EA and UK countries, and the hospitals and the intensive care units are often served with the population of certain regional services, information about cases and the intensive care carets should be provided at the level of the District for State 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and no longer in other countries indicate that COVID-19 developed very quickly in EU/EA and UK.
Thus, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 Community Communicate the amount of CIVD-19 patients that need health care, especially intensive care, as happened in a region in Italy.
As shown in the quick risks of ECCC recently, fast approach, proactive, and commission is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a transfer from the approach approach to mitigasi approach, as quickly as the increase of cases, may not give enough time to making decisions and hospitals to understand, and the responses that are not applied.
Those quick - risk evaluates also combine public health measures to minimize the effects of pandemi.
The window provides a short opportunity when the country has the possibility to improve its efforts in slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If fail, other EU/EA health health systems may have to face an intensive treatment in a few days or a week ahead.
The plague of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19), which is caused by the condition of the accountal syndrome of 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far that it defeated more than 3,000 people and invested over 800,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, which caused disaster to befall mankind.
Mirip with his homolog virus, SARS-CoV, which led SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from bat and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a level ofkeparahan and more manusia than SARS, but more contagious and more about aging than young people, and more to men than women.
As a response to the number of publications rising quickly about this recent disease, this article is trying to give us a review of time and commission about quick research subjects.
our aim will consider the basics of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and physics.
Although there are still many questions we have not yet been asked, we hope that this review helps our understanding and the development of disease that threatens us.
Festival Semi on January 25, 2020 was an unforgettable memory of all Tionghoa people who had been commanded to stay at home for vacations and a few weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus was called SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization (WHO) February 11, 2020, and the disease called CoVase-19 (OVase-19).
Epidemi was early in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and down to about 50 other countries worldwide.
Until 2 March 2020, this virus has led to 800,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with over 400,000 patients returned and 3.000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "sequalifyer number 1" and a potentially corrupter than terrorism.
paranounted PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020, which sets up a virus sequentation from some patients, over 200 therefore it has been published about CvirVID-19, epimologies, techologies, and diagnosis, and treatment.
This Tinjauan industry tries to summarize advances in the in progress of this advanced subject.
As possible, we would try to compare COVD-19 with SARS and disease because of other CoV, which is the Middle Eastapas (MER, outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider how this far learned about prevention and prognosis of disease and other questions that were not answered, but we will also consider.
According to tradition, CoV is considered non-letal patogen for humans, especially causing some 15% pileks 4.
Nevertheless, in the past century, we have found the CoV that is very popular for mankind twice, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each one caused a direct outbreak in Tiongkok in 2003 and Arab Arab in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with the terrible morbidity and human races.
Thus, COVD-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Gbr 1,1, pneumonia klaster first reported from Wuhan on December 31,19 to the National Health Committee of the Tiongkok Republic.
Seven days later, CoV sekuens was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan reported.
Meanwhile, epidemi went on to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a health provider infection reported, which claims that human transmissions might occur.
On January 23 of January, the karantina was held in Wuhan and the entire public transportation stopped.
On January 24, the first chlinist study of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with a chronically confirmed case, only 21 patients were consulted directly with the Wuhan Sea food market that was considered to be the early location of infections from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO identified this plague as a global health emergency.
During the time that this report was written, the disease had been spread throughout the Tiongkok and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr. 2).2).
Because of developing situations very quickly, the final and the death impact of the plague still has to be set.
According to February 11, 2020, a multipusat studi from 8.866 patients include 4.021 CVD-19 confirmed, presented the following episodes://mp.weixin.qqq.com/UlBi-HX_rPEHAbdA.).
SARS-CoV-2 detected people at all ages, but especially at the age of 3065.
Hampir half (47,7%) of the infected people over 50 years old, only a little longer under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people under age 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more investigating men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 meluass in klaster, especially inside and about Hubei.
COVID-19 eats average 5 (2-9) days from awitan until diagnosis.
Periode bakequency is 4,8 (3,0-7,2) day.
average time starts from awitant to death is 9,5 (4,8-13) day.
Base reproduksi angka (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 adapted 2,23-4,82.
The number of infected people are increasingly before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of masif transportation before the Winter Semi in Tiongkok.
patient Mortality with a case confirmed by 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality is defined for all patients at 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
Three major risks for COVID-19 are a type of amlamin (pria), old (Presbyt60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large virus intersection that contains only RNA camels.
KoV can be divided into four genus, which is alpha, me, gamma, and delta, with alpha-and I-CoV known to examine humans.
Glanprotein tonjolan or spike (S) envelopes are mounted with its cell reseptor, angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and are executed for 4 (DPP4) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membran fusion occurs.
Genom RNA virus genome passed into satolasma; after replikasiing virus genome, genomic RNA accompanied glikoprotein envelopes and protein nukleokapsid form vesikels of vesikels, which later suffered fusion by membrandering plasma to release the virus.
The first genomic Sekuens SARS-CoV-2 genomic reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more geneticity than 99,98% between 10 samples executed; the samples are taken from the original location of the Huan Sea of Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
via transmisi electron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles found in a very thin human’s breath plagued parts.
ACE2 human found a prescriptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 proteins testify to the human ACE2 more weak than the SARS-CoV proteins, which fits the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not related to SARS-CoV-CoV infections.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein which is associated with orf3b and proteins that are promoted by the orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in virus patogenisity and inhibisi expression IFN feeling; however, orf8 has no functiononal domain or motive known.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, eth al. reported the complete cryo-EM-EM ACE2 structure of humans on a resolution 2,9  example in complex complex with a B0AT1 ama transporter.
They found that complex, which had open and closed, designed digging and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which became evidence to identify and infection CoV.
B0AT1 can be described as a target in drug filtering to press SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original Inang and intercession
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV known from bat and each one was transferred to mankind by musang and camel.
Using the comparison of the SARS-CoV-2-CoV-2 with other CoV, Kelelawar is considered as the original inang of SARS-CoV-2 because these new virus 96% is identified by two CoV similar-SARSARS from the battils called the Bat-SL-CoVX45 and the bat-SL-CoVX21.
Nevertheless, in theangs that help a virus to prevent species from an unknown, and transmisi route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. menarik the snake as a bearer of virus from a bat to mankind involving homolog recombination in the protein S.
Menurut a study, researcher in Hystri, Tiongkok, suggest that the tenggling, ants’s long-doging mammals are often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potentially as innovative SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% homology on the CoV that was found in the Tenggling and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, 1% differences that spread throughout the genome are still a big difference; therefore, the result is conkonsusive as the evidence of conkret is still unemployed (Gbr. 3).
Most of them are unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can endure 48 hours in dry neighborhoods and up to 5 days on 20 °C and tans of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar traits.
Bidding is recommended that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and hot on 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, etanol 75%, disinfektans containing klorin, asam persetat, chloroform, and other fat linker, but not klorodin, effective use of virus.
umumnya, the entire population of mankind has no immature against SARS-CoV-2 and therefore it is vulnerable to this new virus.
At this time, there are no detailed studi that reports about imunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV study, especially to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
Creeptor-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like reeptor (RR).
via a different path, virus inflictically produce inflictries expression, dendritical cells maturation, and synthesis interferon type I (IFN) which affects the spread of virus and speeds the antigenesis of antigenics by makrofag.
Nevertheless, protein N on SARS-CoV can help virus avoid imuncibilities.
Soon thereafter, responsif immunity joined in battle against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, play a key role in this defense.
The T CD4+ cell cells are instimumating B cells to produce specific antibodis on the virus, and T CD8+ cell kills cells which are infected directly.
Sel T Helper Cell produce proinflite satin to help protect the cell.
Nevertheless, CoV can enslave T cells by processing apoptosis cell T.
The Imunity of humor, which includes the implementation of C3a and C5a, and antibodi as well as the antibodi in the fight of virus infection.
For example, the antibodi who was disfellowshipped from a patient who had recovered MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, more than a lot of imun systems reactions to produce a large number of free radikals locally, which can cause bad damage to any other lungs, and, on the worst skenario, failstur organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 Insected insects that were marked with awitan claster, much more of lansias with the cleric disease of the maidens and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to virus in large numbers or that their imunted functions have a higher chance of being infected than others.
Instrumental dakwat period Estimasi SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on studis against 425 cases first in Wuhan.
But a study of 1.099 cases shows that the average inkubration period is 3 days and is starting from 0 to 24 days.
More studies, as explained above, indicate that the period of inkubasi 4,8 (3,0-7,2) day based on demography 8.866 cases.
Penting sekali, health authorities adjusts karantina times effectively based on the most accurate modement period so that it prevents people who are infected, but without symptoms, emphasizing a virus into others.
As a general praktitik, infected or infected people are usually required tokarnina for 14 days.
Should the carantina time long to 24 days?
Yemam often included the major COVID-19 and early, with or with no other symptoms such as dry, breaths, muscles, limbung, headaches, throat disease, rinorea, dada pain, diare, nausea, and muntah.
Some patients experience dispnea and/or hipoksemia a week after a disease scene.
In a heavy case, patient disease developments have continued to be quickly - growing to quant disease syndrome, cramps, metabolik sydosis, and coagulipati.
Pasien who suffers from fever and/or the artifact symptoms, although without any other lung disorder, must be filtered against the virus to diagnose the dini.
The demography study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms of 98% for fever, 76% for dry rocks, 55% to dispnea, and 3% for diare; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar interviews have been reported in the two recent studis, which are studis on klasters and klasters because of transmisis from asimtomatiks.
Sebrun with that, demography study in 2012 indicated that patient MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry rocks (47%), and dispnea (55%) as his main symptoms.
Nevertheless, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than COVD-19 patients and consistent with the highest DES lethality of MER.
Shere (26%) and the throat pain (21%) also dies to the MERS patient.
On SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry batu (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diare (20-25%), and talks ill (13-25%) shows the main symptoms and ventilation support required for about 14% patients.
Till February 14, COVID-19, or COVID-19, manusia memiliki 2% with credentials, reaching 66.5766 throughout the world.
SARS mortality in November 2002 is a total of 10% of 8096 cases confirmed.
MERS, based on demografi study in June 2012, the mortality of 37% of 2.494 cases confirmed.
studies sebelumnya reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6,47 at the interval of trust (CI) 95% of 5,71-7,23, sementara R0 SARS-CoV-CoV hanya sekitar 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in gejalas, mortality, and R0 are given at Tabel 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher penyebaran abilities than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not unsecessing MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemi is much greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Travel Awitants often found in one family or one group or vehicles such as pesiar ships.
Pasiens often have a trip history or lived in Wuhan or anotherdam region or contacting with infected or patients in the last two weeks before awitant.
Suggested, however, a person may bring a virus without showing more symptoms than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital to bring a virus again, and it causes a sense of urgency to increase carantine.
In the early stage, patients have a count of penetrating white blood cells (limfosit) normal or lower.
For example, limfopenia with numeric white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes limfosit <×109/L, and as opposed to aminotransferase and viremimia that are increasing to 1.099 patient COVID-19.
Muzium rates of heart and muscles and mioglobin are increasing in total patient blood, as well as protein C-reactive and blood rates increased to most of the patients.
patients with heavy cases, the D-dimer rate rises, which is the product of fibrin distribution, and the lympsition counts increase in progress.
The different of the toraks photos were found in a large detail of COVD-19 patients and was marked by a live-up shadow or at the bottom-glass opasity in the paru.
Pasien has often experienced atipis pneumonia, kut lung injured, and quant breath syndrome (ARDS).
While ARDS happens, inflamasi non-interlacable, cairan ammunition, and progress fibrosiss are very insurmount to gas exchange disorders.
Jaranged by pneumosit type I and type II lowers the speed of surfact and lower the pressure of the surface to reduce lung ability to expand and increase the risk of lung slaps.
Therefore, the worst interview of the toraks photos is often paralel with the worst disease level.
18 Februari 2020, theologian analysis of COVID-19 menunjukkan pneumosit pneumosit, hialical membrane, and intersistrasi inflicrasis, and sinitibility in the death of many patients, according to this disease, according to the harmony of the virus infection and ARDS and similarities of the studies of SARS and MER.
The RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through a rekripsi polimerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for CIVD-19 diagnosis.
But as the height of a negative level, which can speed up the epidemi, the clinical statement began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in the 13 February 2020.
Similar situation occurred to the SARS diagnosis.
Thus, combinations of disease and clinissation, laboratorium test, and radiologis interviews are very important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang, a group of protocols menjelaskan the use of SHERLOCK-CRISPR techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA SARS-CoV-2 sintetik on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copy of the input cel per microliter copy in less than one hour.
May it be that these new techniques can have a very high effect on sensitivity and facilities if they areverified on clinic samples.
Because of experience with the new CoV, doctors are especially offering supportive treatments to COVD-19 patients, as long as they try to use or apply to other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other virus disease (Tabel 2).2).
Theseapis include therapies that are now present and potential therapy with medications, imunosupres, steroid, plasma of patients that are recovered, Tionghoa traditional medicines, and psychologic support.
Even the plasma of a patient who has been healed has been approved to be used in the therapy.
Farming companies have developed antibodi and vaccines against this virus.
At the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacked lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidneys.
But instigators and respiratory failures are the primary threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Because of that, breathing support is important to lighten up the symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasif ventilation, and invasif ventilation, depending on the level of disease.
The Pasien with heavy exercise symptoms must be supported by extrakorporeum membrane oxygen (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmoner technique used for heart failure treatment or a treatment that threatens the soul.
Additionally, electrolit balances, pengawalans, secondary infection treatments, and medical organ protection are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
MARS and MERS patients have been identified as much immunity as the most distant part of the system’s system reacts to the result of a storm.
Lantaining Badai satokin is the form of the systemic inflation marking the excretion release of lossans of satokins, which include TNF secara TL-1 berdoa, IL-2, IL-6, IFN church, IFN church, IFN church, and MCP-1.
These Sitkin-sitins are in harmony with the imuncient cells to release a large number of free radikals that become the primary cause of ARDS and failing organs.
The Imunosupresi is so important in the prevention of a satokin, especially on severe patient.
Kortikosteroid and Tocilizumab, a anti-IL6 antiklonal anti-IL6 anti-colonal, has been used to cope with a waokin storm.
The other imunosuprecies for the storm satokin include the response modules that were directed by T cells; the IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; inhibidies of JAK; blinatumomab; a sitokin signal 4; and inhibitor HDAC.
Steroid, as an imunosupresan, many are used in SARS treatments to reduce inflatiori damageparahan.
But the steroid on high dose is worthless to hurt the lungs on SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Sebaliknya, steroid can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which affects prognosis.
Nevertheless, a brief cor Hayesteroid gift at the dose is substantiated to be given careful to the COVID-19 patient.
On this review, there was not yet a effective therapy that had been confirmed.
Alternatively, however, a nuclearleotida analog, was found nutritious to a COVVID-19 of the United States.
Recognisevir was a new drug developed by Gilead, again for the health treatment of the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, redesivir also indicates inhibition to other single camels RNA virus, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
According to this way, Gilead prepares this gift for Tiongkok to try a test series on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the result is eager.
Additionally, baricitinb, interferon-head, lopinavir/ritonavir, and Labvirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with quanapas symptoms.
Diare, nausea, muntah, heart damage, and other side reactions can happen after combinations with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other treatments that a patient has to be carefully monitored.
The Plasma of patients that have been healed and have antibodi creations
There is a long history of patient blood gatherings that have been healed from a disease to cure other patients suffering similar illness or to prevent sick people from being infected.
Of course, sick patients often have relative antibodi rates in his blood.
Antibodi is an imunoglobulin which has produced lymphosit B to fight patogen and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in patogens, and directs them.
According to this, plasma is gathered from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are injected to 10 sick patients.
Their Gejala is fine in 24 hours, along with its downs are inflamation and virus loads and increases the saturation of oxygen in blood.
Nevertheless, verifikasi and clarification needs to be done to provide the methods for the use of big scales before specificrapies were developed.
Moreover, instead of the effects of his claspic effect, some of its knotifications are related to the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodi can analyze an innovative responses and causes the loss of satokin syndrome, which is a potentially potentially threatening soul.
Antibodi concentrations in blood are typically low and plasma is required in large amounts to care for critical patients.
Experts and antibodi production are specific enough to fight hard global episodes.
Hence, above all, more important and practically evaluating B cells from a patient who has been healed and identifys genetic codes that have effective antibodied or do effective antibodi filters that are effective to the proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase antibodi production rates.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of its effects depends on combinations of components in the formula.
Most of the effective components are still not yet known or are not yet obvious because it is difficult to extract or verify the components or its optimal combination.
Today, because effective therapy is specific for COVID-19 not yet present, TCM becomes one of the major alternative therapys for patients with light symptoms until now or for those who recover from heavy diseases.
Take, for example, kapsul Shu Feng Jie Du and the Lian Hua Qing Wen Wen found mangurs for COVID-19 therapy.
The top defeat rate of the COVD-19 patient therapy was observed in some Tiongkok provinces that used TCM on 87% patients, which included Gansu (63,7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei Province, use TCM only in 30% patient CIVID-19, had a low test.
Nevertheless, this comparison is still very rude because many other effects are, such as the amount and the loss of patients, and it has to be included in evaluasi.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends memplified a study that compares west drug therapy (WM) with the WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed for the body temperature recovery, the symptoms lost, and the instrument nurses are very short to the WM+TCM group instead of the WM.
The more impressive thing, the level of hunters (from weight to heavy) are much lower for the WM+TCM group than the WM group (7,4% than 46,2%) and the commonity is lower on the WM+TM group than with the WM only group (8,8%).
Nevertheless, TCM efficiency and security are still waiting for a better trial at a scale greater and at more research center.
Another interesting thing is that it identifies the work mechanism and indicate effective components in the TCM therapy or combinations, if possible.
Most patients who were expected or confirmed by the CVID-19 were apprehensive of severe disease and even dissatisfied of this, and those who were dikarantitioned, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, infections such as demam, hypothesia, and coughs and therapy side effects such as insomnia, due to corsteroid can cause greater anxiety and emotional stress.
At the beginning of the SARS plague, a series of psychiatristian morbidity, which includes depression, emergency, panic attacks, psychologists, psychologists, delirium, and even the suditionalities were reported.
Instigators of contact and carantina history are mandatory, as part of the response to the health of the COVID-19 COVID, can make people more anxious and more guilty of respiratory effects, carantina, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, expected people, and especially those with them, as well as the general general society needs.
psychologist support must include priminal mental - health team format, clear communication with routine update and accurate understanding of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and therapy articles and use device and professional electronic apps to avoid contact near each other.
effective Vaksins are very important to memutuize transmisi chains from animals' reservoirs and humans are infected to rented in the insecurity and often perfect therapies in control of the epidemis due to the existence of the virus.
The Upaya has been done to develop protein-based vaccine S, which is long-termly and effective, make antibodicipation and/or imunity that protects SARS-CoV.
The SARS, a life-separated vaccine, has been distributed to experiment animals.
Nevertheless, efficiency in the vivo candidat of this vaccine atsia and models of membiarkanal and protection against spiritual virus infection still has to be determined before klinis studi began.
This issue may have been because SARS had 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the contrary, sporadis and klaster MERS cases continue to go through the Middle East and spread to other areas because there was a source of kebun binatangnotics in the province ofawas.
pasangan vaccine strategys have been developed for MERS by using an disabled virus, DNA navigator, virus vectors, particles, particles, virus similar characteristics, and rekombinan protein subunition and some have been distributed in the experimental animals.
vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 safe and effective for non-imune is a very urgent and vital task to control the current epidemi.
But this difficulty is not easy to bear because of a long time to develop a vaccine (rata-rata 18 months) and variation of the dynamic CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started to show him the constant trip in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be healed without a measure of sequela.
But the same thing is true of SARS and MERS, COVID-19, also associated with high morbidity and mortality on patients with heavy cases.
Thus, prognosis models of prognosis are important to health care bodys in order to promote his service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Berdasarkan a chronic studis that are reported so far, the following factors can affect or associate with the prognosis of CVD-19 (Tabel 3) patients:
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurred for COVID-19.
COVID-19 has particularly been in 30-65 years with 47,7% patients above 50 years of drives in a study containing 8866 cases as explained above.
The Pasien who needs intensive treatment tends to have the end of the CIVIDICE and compossibility of elderly patients who do not need intensive treatment (nown 66 years) are required to determine age as prognostic factor for the end of CVID-19 patients.
Crying type: SARS-CoV-2 is more investigating men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0,27/100,000), as explained above.
Komperimensial and compilation: Casien CIVD-19 which requires intensive treatments has kemungkinan besar mengalami an intensive heart injury and aritmia.
Heart events also create a major cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reported that can also confront with alangiosit with ACE2-positif, which can lead to a success of heart on CIVD-19 patient.
The need to be noted that age and disease is very popular and that it can affect each other.
abnormal laboratory discoveries: protein rate C-reactive (CRP) in blood mencerminkan inflamanity or jaringan cedera and was approved as potential prognostik factor for disease, responses to therapy, and final recovery.
Korelation between the CRP rate and the parasenity and the Cgnosis of CVID-19 has also been approved.
Additionally, increase in dehidrogene (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), alanin amirantferase (ALT), and kreatinine kinase (CK) can also helppresecute result.
These Enzims are expressing very high in various organs, especially in heart and heart, and released during the network damage.
Therefore, these enzims are traditional markers for heart and hearts function.
Main klinis Gejala: Photos of toraks and temporal clinics have to consider together with other things to predict the end and the CIVID-19 result.
steroid usage: As such is explained above, steroid is an imunosupresan which are often used as a barrier therapy for infection disease to reduce inflate damage.
Because of the high - dosis kor Hayesteroids of synthesis patients of severe SARS, many people survived this disease eventually have avascular osteonekrosis with disabilities for the rest of their lives and harmful quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids must be used on a lower dose and run short time on COVID-19 patient.
Pressure pressure: As noted above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced remarkable stress because they have to exercise long - term carantina and unemployment and to witness death to close relatives and patients.
psychologists and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demography study this far, COVID-19 tampaknya has a description of epidemiologise that differs from SARS.
Besides replications on the lower internction channel, SARS-CoV-2 can form efficiently on topapas and causes light symptoms or symptoms at the beginning of infection, similar to other coVs that cause turbulence.
Thus, at the early phase or the cubation period, infected patients can produce a virus in large number of days of activity, which cause great difficulties to control epidemi.
However, SARS-CoV dipercaya transmisi happens when patients are injured and most people do not happen at early phases.
Thus, the COVID-19 outbreak is now far worse and hard to control from the SARS plague.
Today, great effort is being done in Tiongkok, which includes the karantina region Wuhan and cities around and the carantinas continued almost all populations with the hope of the SARS-CoV-2 transmisi.
Even though these acts are very damaged by economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients fell down, which indicate epidemi delay.
The most optimistic Estimasi stated that the outbreak will end in March and the phase of the year after 3-4 months.
But several other experts are not of the same age.
Paul Hunter et al. Identification that COVID-19, which seems much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Bidden Ira Longini, et al. make model to predict the result of epidemi and declare that SARS-CoV-2 can detect two per third populations of global populations.
The Grup Canadian researcher reported that SARS-CoV-2 detected in mid-konka and patient throats who had recovered from hospital 2 weeks earlier.
Nevertheless, the signs of promised to happen in Tiongkok, if seen by the drop of a new case, which indicates that the current strategy might work.
Predictioned Ebola will cause one million cases with half death.
But with carantina and observantation were tight, the disease ended up in control.
potentially, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, I weakened his ability to reach and finally disappear or become a virus not too patogen that can have a relationship with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 with the epidemi of SARS and MERS is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy being transferred through coughs or penetrating, and perhaps through direct contact with materials that are contaminated by the virus.
This virus was found also found on the feses that led to the possibility of a new transmission, which is a transmisi feses-to-lut.
Recently, studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosokomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health treatment providers.
Hence, proper treatments must be performed to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who kebetulan consult with patients or infected people.
The first defense Lini used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masker, both surgeon masks and N95 masks (answer 1860) help mengendalikan virus penyebaran.
Masker bedah provides a lookout to keep someone with a potentially infected sparks in the air or sticking on the surface of the material, where those ludahs can continue to go to others.
Bingo, however, only masker N95 (takmor series 1860-an) can protect against viration inhalation with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can concentrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV in size, both are considered about 85 nm.
Because particles can reorganized even five surgeons assigned to one, medical treatment providers that are immediately consulted with patients must wear N95 (ans series 1860-an) instead of the operating mask.
addition to the masker, health treatment providers must wear pasolation robe to reduce contact with virus.
Virus virus can have a vision of someone through his eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a N95 mask; the virus might go into his body through an eye - conditioning.
Therefore, health care providers also need to put on a breastplate of eyes or glasses while working with patients.
The public’s publicity in the region has been credentials or potentially clerked, is very suggested for everyone to wash his hands with soaps are covered more often than usual, trying to stay at home in the homes of man’s carantina, and avoid contact with the potentially infected people.
At least three feet are believed that they should keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus penyebaran.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the world, its high homologist with SARS-CoV, just as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a large reminder to Tiongkok who has a strong memory of SARS outbreak in 2003.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, director of Wuhan’s disease Center comforted the people by saying that this new virus has a low penyebaran and a limited reproductive capacity from humans and phesition and plumbing that this disease are not a problem.
This message really calms the fear of society, especially during the entire state, is preparing the Winter Semi Festival, so that this critical time is overturned to block disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The body of disease in Tiongkok should take lessons from this and make major repairs in the future.
For example, these bodys should be (1) more careful when it is making public announcements for every word being noted and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactivation information on clinics than waiting for official reports from a doctor or authorities; (3) more concerned to block the potential in the early stage, and (4) attempt not to ease public acceleration; and (4) more often disecute the public training and use public awareness of public disease and the environment.
COVD-19 Wabah due to the new virus SARS-CoV-2 which began to spread at the end of December 2019.
In less than 2 months, outbreaks have spread throughout the Tiongkok and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because these viruss are similar to SARS-CoV and COVD-19 and SARS symptoms similar to that same, the COVID-19 outbreaks make impression like the SARS outbreaks again.
Yet, there are some contrasts between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to block epidemi and handle patients.
COVID-19 describes more lansia than young people and more about men than women, and death is also higher than young people.
SARS Mortality is higher than CVID-19 (10,91% instead of 1,44%).
Casien CIVD-19 mengalihkan a virus even when they were without symptoms, while SARS patients often incurred the virus when they get sick, this makes a bigger difficulty in the spread of CVID-19 than SARS.
This article explains some reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Asai RNA routine to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVD-19 patients.
On the other hand, heal patients can give positive results in the virus checks.
This meeting really increased the risk of virus witnessing.
As soon as the progress of COVID-19, some important problems still need to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Walaupun genetic homology found a total of 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV similar-SARS bat bat, we still haven't able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bat.
What animal species of intervens to transmisi the virus from the original inangs, say bat, to mankind?
Without knowing the answer to first number 1 and 2, we can't remutating transmisis effectively and outbreaks can spread back each second.
Despite molekuler and biokimia moderation as well as biochema indicate that SARS-CoV-2 bond with ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the breath line cell and cause changes to next patological change?
Does this virus also communicate with cells that define ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach rapid and accurate and effective treatment.
How long will this episode go on?
How does virus develop genetically during transmisi between humans?
Does this pandemi become a whole world's pandemi, end up like SARS, or rereditionally like a flu?
The answers to questions above and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, we have no other choice but to stop this epidemi as soon as possible as possible to get back to normal life.
Human korona virus asal 338
ribuan years, mutation and adapt have moved korona virus korona (CoV) and inangs, including humans.
early in 2003, two human CoV (HCoV) known to membuat light disease, such as fluesma.
A heavy quant syndicate syndrome (SARS) and Central East Eastern syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveal how much HCoV infection can be very damaged and threatened by soul.
His Muncul SARS-CoV-2 at Tiongkok in the end of 2019 has made CoV sorotan back and surprised us with high transmissions, but with a lower relapsibility than his brother, SARS-CoV.
Because of HCoV Infessibilities, HCoV’s original understanding of the HCoV will be beneficial for us.
Most of the HCoV comes from bats, on this animal, the virus is not very patogenic.
Inang Inservoir reservoir of some HCoV has also known.
The indentification of the animal has its direct application in human disease control.
Investigators of CoV-inang anticipation on animals can also give us special thought about patogenesis CoV.
In this review, we present a public description of the seven HCoV, by focusing on his discovery history and its origin and intersecution transmisi.
The important thing is, we compare and adjust the HCoV from that view of evolution and the recombination of genome.
Epidemi disease CoV 2019 (COVD-19) is currently discussed in this context.
Also, the consecution of insecurity efficiency of the infernostics, or evolution, has also been sympathized.
KoV virusrus (CoV) berasal from the Coronaviridae family, which is made up of a group of RNA viruss consembled, positive, and single beeties.
This virus has the largest genome with the size of 26 to 32 kilobasa among the RNA virus called "CoV", because his morfology is like a crown under electron microscope.
According to its structure, CoV has unregnizable genome that has similar tiredes.
kira - kira two third genoms consisted of two large open outlines (ORF1b and ORF1b) each other overlast. Both aretranslated to be polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
Poliprotein has further processing to form 16 nonstructal proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remnant of genoms consisted of open read order (ORF) for structureal proteins, which include tonjolan or spike (S), cubung or a envelope (E), membran (M), and noloprotein (N).
A number of proteins specific for a specific line of descent are also included by various CoV’s descendants.
According to the difference between the differences of protein Sekuens, CoV terklasifikasi into four genus (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); between the fourth genus I-CoV, the genus must have at most HCoV and is divided into four line (A, B, C, C, and D).
filogenetic evidence indicates that the bats and the resilient animals are the source of genes that are most genes of the alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while unggas are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
Yet, for thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the species barriers and some CoV have become a fundamental patogen on humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs (HCoV) known.
between the seventh virus, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 were alpha-CoV.
5 otheraku-CoV meliputi HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 virus the most powerful disease disease disease (SARS-CoV), the korona disease of Middle Eastern Timur (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are usually causing light symptoms, such as pilek and/or diare.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patogenic, causing heavy breath infections on relative patients and has a higher chance to develop a quant disorder disorder (ARDS) and manifestation outside of the lung organ.
First HCoV-229E Strain, B asking for the diisolation of a patient ingusy in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, the more knowledge is gathered through a deep studi toward HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused a cure.
In fact, this concept has been widely received that the HCoV infection is more dangerous until the SARS outbreak occurs.
SARS Wabah that happened in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in history today, which infected over 2,000 people with harsh deaths about 10%.
Centuries later, a Middle East Eastern syndrome (MERS) epidemi has continued to continue in the Arab Semenanjung by preaching sporadiks to other parts of the world.
The new H.V.CoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later referred to SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the epidemi epirona disease 2019 (COVD-19), who has taken his life over 3.120 people and more than 91.000 people are reaching with 3 March 2020.
Alarms are already blown and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandom.
Seven HCoV all had the origin of the zoonotic from bat, rats, or pets.
streams of evidence supporting the origin of the evolution of all the HCoV of bats.
Epidemi COVID-19 has tested medical, scientific, social, and outstanding morals for Tiongkok and the whole world.
HCoV's original zoocle has given a job frame to understand natural history, alarm management, and deterioration factor that happens between species.
These studies can also drive or detect a search of invigoir animals, intervenanc, intervens, intersects, and SARS-CoV-2, which has a significant application in the penyebaran prevention at the time of the coming.
In this ossuary, we give a general description of kebun binatangnotic, intersecessi transmisi, and patogenesis HCoV.
Our body is primarily identified and discussed the general subject that the HCoV’s parent virus was typically non-patical in his naturalservoir, but it became patogenik after transmisi interspesies into the new interior.
We also commented on HCoV’s evolution that transmisi’s ability intensives are often accompanied by patogenitia drops.
The end of the episode of SARS-CoV-2 is also presented in this context.
The CoV animals have been known since the end of 1930s.
Genetics before the HCoV-2E mengleolation HCoV-2E mengheret the first patient ingus of fluesma, various CoV have been distributed from infected animals, which include kalkun, rats, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few basewarsa, seven HCoV has been identified.
The short history of HCoV’s discoveries in chronological order (Tabel 1) is an informative petunjuk.
The first HCoV-229E Strain was distributed from the patient's breath channel that had a breathline infection above 1966, which was later adapted to the lining of the WI-38 lung cell.
The Pasien that was infected by HCoV-229E showed a selesema symptoms, which include headaches, tunes, and ill health, with fever and coughs seen on 10~20% of the case.
Next year, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 diisolated from organ cultures and order seriess in the brains that were still sucking.
The description of the HCoV-OC43 infections seems to be similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E, which isally unbetended with other physical patogen channels infections such as the virus influenza A and rhinovirus.
H.CoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread throughout the world, and most likely most of them are ditransisited during the winters of the increase in the ministry.
Normally, the time for these two viruss is less than a week and they are followed by a sick time for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteer, healthy people infected HCoV-229E with light cells.
Only a few patients with a weak state of disability that reveal the infection of a heavy breath channel.
SARS, known as "pneumonia atipis", is the first during which the first HCoV was documented well in human history and its etiology agents are SARS-CoV, which are found three HCoV.
SARS’s first case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in the Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
Epidemi SARS mengakibatkan 8.096 cases reported with 774 death, which spread throughout many countries and continents.
Despite being released from superular, each case is expected to cause some two secondary cases, with time in tubes 4 to 7 days and virus load peaks are visible on the 10th day of disease.
The patient Pasien who was infected with SARS-CoV initially had a mialgian, a headache, a fever, and agilant, followed by dispnea, rocks, and breath disorders.
Limfopenia, test a normal heart function, and increase in the creatin kinase is a common laboratorium in SARS.
The flow of alveolar, epitel cell proliferation, and the increase of marofag is also observed by SARS patients.
Further, about 20-30% patients require medical treatments and mekanical ventilation.
Besides the lowerapale channels, some organs that include gastrointestinal channels, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, often accompanied with a wane storm, which can turn off, especially on patients that are weak.
The first member of the biopsy who travel to Hong Kong from Hystri.
Since then, great effort was dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was mengasingkaned from 7 months from the Netherlands in the late 2004 ’ s.
These viruss begin to be especially unusual for young, old, and weak patients who suffer from severe disease.
The image of koriza, cooritivitis, fever, and bronkiolitis are common to diseases due to HCoV-NL63.
Other Independent Station explains the same virus amolation from the necesimen of exhala son of 8 months of pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identification in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents some 4,7% public exercise disease and that the peak of the incident occurred at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 links with obstructive laris, called corruption.
At the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was concluded from a 71 - year - old man who had been hospitaled for pneumonia and bronkiolitis in Hong Kong.
Other than pneumonia and bronchiolitis komunitis, HCoV-HKU1 reported to the account of the int customa.
Cubicle with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found throughout the world, causing light pernapasan disease.
The four HCoV community community has been adapted to human beings and most commonly the possibility of having a little weight to be a very patogen disease, although the incredible case is happening because of some unknown reasons, such as in the case of the HCoV-NL63 sub-encrulen case recently reported a major breath infection under Tiongkok.
Generally, when it is the ability to move in efisien and maintain oneself within humans, viruency and navigator of HCoV are also reduced.
U.S. M.A., in 2012, from a 60 - year - old patient's lungs of patients who had a lot of synumonia and failing kidneys in Arab.
Although most cases have been confirmed by laboratorium from central Eastern lands, the import case sometimes has been reported to a secondary contact in many European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary Wabah occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The MERS clinical Manifestasi is similar to the SARS clinical slinis manifestation, which is related to the progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also failed myth kidneys, which just so far has happened to MERS among the disease caused by HCoV.
Lebih daripada 30% patients showed symptoms of gastrointestinal, such as diare and muntah.
Sehingga February 14, 2020, over 2500 the laboratorium confirmed are reported with a high case death, which is about 344%, making MERS-CoV into one of the most scary virus known by humans.
At midweek to the end of December 2019, the pneumonia patient clasters  retroptive are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections found in Wuhan, Province Hubei, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the plague of breath infections continue and are caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the Global Health Department and the name of the disease COD-19.
Until 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed throughout the world, with a severe case rate of death is 3,4%.
Requires to be noted, the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, a height of 4,2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei of 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by the image of fever, rocks, and breath.
Diare was also found on a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy symptoms and can quickly develop into a quant breath disorder syndrome.
Walaupun SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are much similar because the high- nukleotida sequence homoda, $ 82%, both raced into a different filogenetic tree branch.
SARS-CoV-2’s Patogonisity is somewhat lower, but more contagious than with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms had been reported and may have acted in the fast SARS-CoV-2 field throughout the world.
Cocosing and conforming to SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs indicate that the equation and differences are very interesting.
First, the time for tubes and the travels to HCoV’s disease are much similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the other six HCoV.
Second, the COVD-19 embassy lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoV-229E (yaki HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common description of the Community HCoV infection, which includes the description of the light nonsecifik or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVD-19 case can seem like SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmisi also shows an attractive pattern, has amiript with komunity HCoV or SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 transmisiability at least is equal to the height of the community HCoV.
On the other hand, it is not possible for SARS-CoV-2 transmission ability after some lines on humans still need to be verified, just as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV case.
Last, like other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from feses samples.
"Is the transmisi SARS-CoV-2 important fekal-oral fekal, such as in the case of SARS-CoV transmisi, at least in certain situations, it must still be organized by the next studi. "
The matter that is also important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasoned as in the case of community HCoV.
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmisi abilities, patogenity, and penyebaran in several lines of human beings, will greatly affect the end of the COVD-19.
Fourth HCoV communityity that cause light symptoms all have adapted to human beings.
Seeing from other perspectives, the human could say that people have adapted to this four HCoV.
In other words, HCoV and humans may be the species of pandemi HCoV of ancient times.
HCoV, who has causing serious illness to mankind, and humans who have suffered from a heavy HCoV illness have been destroyed.
In order to do this, HCoV had to form in humans enough amounts to enable adaptive mutation to resist the factors of the inang.
Thus, the longer the plague of SARS-CoV-2 endure and the more people infected, the greater likely these virus are adaptable to human beings.
If the virus is adapted properly, its transmission on humans will be difficult to stop with carantine or other infection measures.
His name was taken on to the population of mankind for many years, and he used a fluctuation to make it available for people who have been maximised.
This virus doesn't need any repservoirs of animals.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that are so patogenic has not been adapted to humans and its transmission in human beings can't be maintained.
Both of them have to defend themselves and do reproducing in the zoonotic reservoirs and search for opportunities to spread to a vulnerable human target, perhaps through one or some intercessor.
SARS-CoV-2 has a description similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four komunity HCoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy being transferred like komuniti HCoV, at least now.
But SARS-CoV-2 is more patogenic than komuniti HCoV and is not very common in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Gentle must still be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to human beings and coordinate in humans without the inservoir or interservoir animals.
these are aspects of evolutiononer, alami, reservoir, phenomenal, and HCoV impossibility.
Parawan Hes bertindak as an inang evolusioner HCoV if having a close - minded ancestors and shared high homology at a rate of nucleotida nucleotida.
Aspects of our ancestors are often adapted to good and unparaptogenic in thisang.
Similarly,servoir reservoirs carry HCoV terus and within a long period of time.
In those cases, the intuitionally infected and is natural inangs for HCoV or the parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV just entered the intersect before or about the time that the virus entered into mankind, the virus has not been adapted to the new influentials and often has become passive.
These intersects can be functioned as the source of human infections and act as an indentification by allowing the virus to appear temporarily, then transfer it to human beings to recognize human infections.
HCoV can undergo a buntu infection unless it is not possible to defend its transmission in the interior of the intercessors.
At the same time, HCoV, it may be adapted to the instrumentary and even cause long - term endemis.
In this case, in theangs of intersection became a natural reservoir.
epidemiologis data reveal retrospectively that case of SARS has a history of contact with an animal of hunts.
The next terminvalence investigation indicates that the sales of the animal have an anti-SARS-CoV common population which is higher than the common population.
The moon Mosesng (Alarvata Paguma) and the dog rakun at the market of life is the first to identify bring a virus similar to the SARS-CoV-like virus.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the musangs in the market were killed.
That's the case, reported that the moon musangs of wild animals or the farms that are not traced to the market of life animals are most likely to give a negative test for SARS-CoV.
Practice should be noted, since 80% of various animals at the market Hystri has anti-SARS-CoV anti-coV anti-coV antibodi, that many small mammal species also work as SARS-CoV.
All these inangs seem to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The natural animal search for SARS-CoV next revealed a close - knit bat CoV, called CoV bat bat Rhinolopus relatives-SARS HKU3 (SARSARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tiongkok kuda batlabar.
This Kelelawar has brought positive tests for anti-SARS-CoV anti-CoV antibodi and sekuens genom SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
these CoV CoV and the other bat CoV shares an innovative nucleotida nukleoda 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study has been a foundation for the new concept that the bat is the inang for new human patogens.
Some CoV similar-SARS (SL-CoV) also identified from bat, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a virus alive.
known angiotensin nargeter (ACE2) is a prescriptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1, a sample of bat bat batfes, is shown by ACE2 bat, musang, and man as a reseptor to get into the cell.
Interesting thing, serum patients SARS convalesen can secure WIV1.
far, WIV1 representing the most intimate ancestry of SARS-CoV in bat, with a homology of the nucleotida of 95%.
The release of the homology between these two viruss is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bat bat insurable reservoir is not SARS-CoV.
Analogenetic filogenetic syndicate MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bat bat and CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bat bat and MERS-CoV uses the same inang reseptor, which is called a 4-DPP4 (DPP4), as the entrance of the virus.
The RNA polimerase Sequency RNA depends dengan-RNA MERS-CoV- filogenetis secara filogenetis closer to his match at the quant of the bat-coV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, there are no MERS-CoV living in wild bat.
MERS-CoV and her closest relative, CoV-HKU25 bat bat shares 87% homology sekuens nucleotida.
Hence, Kelelawar may not be insemblant MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, study in the Middle East menunjukkan that Arab camels have been given an antiboditif for specific antibodi that promote MERS-CoV, just as the Middle East camel in some state of Africa.
MERS-CoV lived an identification with a virus that was found in human being found from the Arab camels weap, which indicate more about the camel is the actual reservoir instrument for MERS-CoV.
The very important thing is that the virus ammunition is masifibility with symptoms that are commonly identified to experiment camels that are diagnosed with MERS-CoV.
The need to be noted, the camels infected with viruss are not just through the renapas route, but also through the fecal-oral routes, which are the main route of the virus bulletans from the bat.
Nevertheless, questions still remain unanswered because many cases of MERS have no contact history with camels before the outbreak, perhaps the result of human transmissions or the transmission routes that are unknown to species of humans.
SARS-CoV-2 share 96,2% nukleotida homology with CoV batelawar RaTG13 which is distributed from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
Like in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sekuen difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to set parent connection.
In other words, Kelelawar may not be an inservoir of SARS-CoV-2 direct reservoir, except if CoV bat bat found almost identics later.
possibly, in the midst of SARS-CoV-2, there are some wild satwa species that sold and were killed in the Huani Food Mosir Assembly. Many cases early COVD-19 are related to this market, which indicate that the possibility of transmisi-human.
Some recent study studies based on metagenomic quantities indicate that a group of small mammals are threatened, known as trenggiling (Manis javanica), may also lead to the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2.
This new Genom CoV shared 85-92 homology as nukleotida with SARS-CoV-2.
But the CoV, however, is equal to RaTG13 with the same commonity as 90% on the rate of nucleotida nukleotida.
These two are groupsed into two virus subgariss similar to SARS-CoV-2 in filogenetic tree, one of which shares a prescriptor binding domain (RBD) which is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a similar form of amino acid of 97,4%.
The rest of the things that are drawn, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are much more different, even though the highest homology level of the entire genome.
preceding a study on a sick trenggil also reported virus contecrets from a scar sample, which actually interfered with SARS-CoV-2.
These studys adopt a different method of sculpture and manual ration to produce parsial genome that consisted of about 86,3% of complete virus genome.
Kini, we cannot summarize the possibility of trenggiling as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intervens.
Yet, at this point there are no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 by langsung from trenggiling because of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and me-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tenggil.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and me-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
Setelah melalui evolusioner SARS-CoV-2 recorded in bat, trenggil, and other mammals still have to be set.
Despite the highest homology on RBD found between SARS-CoV-2 and my U.S.V.-S.-SARS.-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share highest homology at the entire genome.
Encouraging too much to be said that the highest level between the  RBD-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 tropgiling and SARS-CoV-2 was moved by the evolution of convergens that are intervevity.
KoV-2 trenggiling and RaTG13 in the species of third wild animals.
As a evolutionary alarm factor, recombination took place among my members-CoV.
Researchers are still not able to decide what the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is.
Other than HCoVV, the origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been placed.
filogenetic evidence evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have come from CoV batwar, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 virus have been found in therat animal.
Ekoran is recommended that CoV batlat, ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), who was diagnosed in a three - color batch of North America, shows a closeness to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E geneticized with other CoV batewar, with the names of Hipposidesideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which is detected in Ghana, with Camelidae expected to be his intercede.
To be clearer, knowledge of the origin of the HCoV animals that are known to be in the image 1 and Tabel 2.
filogenetic Analisis has given evidence of intersepsi transmisi HCoV in history.
At about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 saw species of cattle to influate humans, there was recorded perapas infection environment.
antara transmisi history HCoV-229E is not too clear.
The bat bat Alpha-CoV Alpha-coV has been found with HCoV-229E.
between them, there are alpaka alpha-CoV.
evidence menyokong virus transmisi directly from bat to mankind.
First, man, not a alpaka, which may have been conspiring with batsemblans in the ecological relungs together.
Instead, on the other hand, people have contact with an alpaka.
Second, bat-CoV alpha-coV dealt with HCoV-229E has a variety of and non-stogenics in bat, while the alpha-CoV alpaka causes a disease outbreak to a infected animal.
Last time, alpaka alpha-CoV was not found in feral animals.
Hence, it is possible that alpaka get an alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E of humans could not be crossed.
In fact, Kelelawar is a live source of human patogenic virus, which includes rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Thus, it is not too surprising that the bate may directly transfer H.CoV-229E to mankind.
Other possibilitys, while the alpha-CoV bat functioning as the HCoV-229E gen lungkang, alpaka and Arab camels may work as an instrument that transfers the virus to humans, just as the case MERS-CoV-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for intersecution transmisi from bat to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The origin of evolutionary MERS-CoV of bat known at the initial identification of the virus is also reinforced with the date after it.
Jelas sekali, Kelelawar is a source of rich virus species to exchange intersecese and intersection transmisi.
Long-termurs, colonis that are intersectioned, close social interaction, and strong flying abilities, all are the circumstances that support for bat to become the ideal virus penyebar'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has already entered the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to camels that have changed from the inangs into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV has caused a very light disease and has kept the lower mutation speed that is relative to this animal.
His sporadic transmission happens by chance and human beings remain the end of the MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camel in the MERS-CoV transmisi, trenggiling peran, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmisi differs.
Especially, beta-CoV tegiling is very patogenik in trenggiling.
Tenggiling may be the final instrument for my SARS-CoV relatives-CoV-2, similar to musangs in the case of SARS-CoV.
Bimbing in the men's study-tour, some possibility of transmisi SARS-CoV-2 intersecesies from animal to humans must be viewed or executed.
First, Kelelawar could be a reservoir invigoir for SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus that almost identicated SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological resepars with bats through relating or bara rocks.
Second, trenggiling could be one of the intersects of intersectors for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
People mendapatkan virus through relaying and sparing meats.
Maybe, many mammals, which include pets, menyewas against SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodi Survei terhadap pets and wild animals must be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombining and adapting SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that can be done well with batars and trenggiling.
SARS-CoV-2's original animal search still stands.
Out of many kinds of animal inangs, three main factor on the virus side is also important to simplify CoV over the species’s barrier.
First, the highest mutation speed is relative to RNA replication.
Dibanding with another single RNA virus, the estimate of the CoV mutation rate can be considered "while" to "height" at an average rate of ~10-4 per year, depending on the CoV adaption of the new inang.
KoV has an eksoribonuklease of detecting, removal which causes very high mutabilities, inentasi, or even inviabilities.
The interesting thing is, the nuclear analog Redesivir known to menekan the replikasi of CoV through these exoperators and RNA polimerase hanging-RNA.
Recresivir was one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 most promising agents that would be tested in the clinical experiments.
Nevertheless, CoV mutation speed is about a million times higher than the instrument speed.
Besides, mutasi speed is often high when CoV has not adapted to inang.
Dibanding SARS-CoV with high mutation speed, SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, predicting higher adaption rates with humans.
Kemungkinan besar, SARS-CoV-2 had adapted to another influencing insecurity to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoV who have adapted an Arab camel.
Theoretically theory, it is unlikely that geneticyus will quickly make vaccines and agents of the SARS-CoV-2 become effective.
Second, the big RNA genome in CoV gave extra allocation in genome modified, to mutation and recombination, to improve the interspesion probabilitas probabilitas, which was beneficial to show him the new CoV when conditions were appropriate.
This is supported by a number of read outlines unique and protein functions that are recommended at the end of 36,000 genome.
Third, CoV often changes templates randomly during replication RNA through unique "option-salin" mechanism.
In aang that works as a coup, cameli transcripsi RNA CoV.
The complete RNA and subgenomics that are so homolog can face the recombination to form a new CoV.
alami rekombinasi filogenetic evidence evidence has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, so is CoV animals such as SL-CoV bat bat and CoV-HKUU9 bat.
The interaction of viruss in related to transmisi
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, virus interaction with inang recipes is another factor that affects intersecution transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered an example of special, which also indicates a positive selection during intersecution.
According to a collaboration analysis between the SARS-CoV-coangs and musang, SARS-CoV expected to be adapted quickly in many of the instrument, especially with mutation on the RBD protein S.
Generally, protein RBD S CoV interacted with cell reseptors and intensives into targets of antibodi inang.
Bidding on SARS-CoV, RBD is a 3-18 amino acid to 510th to S1 gragment, which corresponds to the ACE2 humans and his corescriptors as the entrance of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to mengenali the recipe ACE2 various animals, which include bats, musang, tikuss, and dogsuns, to allow interseces virus transmisi.
In fact, only 6 amino acid resemblanted differences between human virus and musangs in RBD and 4 are located at the recipeor's binding motive for interacting with the ACE2 reseptor.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T at his RBD, which may increase tonton protein interactive interaction with the ACE2 recipe.
In other words, these two amino acid substitution may have been very important to adapt the virus to humans.
Requires note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell reseptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV on the S1 protein S1 proteinS unit has published afinitas protein S with ACE2 people may have changed.
Moreover, a cryo-EM studi menunjukkan afinity of the ACE2 binding and protein SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than afinitas between ACE2 humans and protein SARS-CoV.
The important thing to know is whether there are other corescriptors that may need for SARS-CoV-2 transmisi.
Interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 also dealt with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other prescriptors of HCoV, such as aminoptidation N for HCoV-229E and asam fuckers 9-O-terasetilation for HCoV-OC43.
These Receptors may also be involved in the success of this CoV adaption in humans after intersect transmission from the animal.
Besides cell reseptors, intersecution transmisi HCoV results are also organized by the dependencies and bounds of other inangs.
These inang protein differences between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and impor animals can be a barrier to intersect transmisi.
HCoV must take over the insecurity factor and collaborate the instrumental factors that help it to succeed in the intersecution transmission.
In this case, molecular molekuler in the field of interactions of vital viruss must still be identified and maintained.
Filtering the entire genome is unnatural to see the factors of dependencies and bounds of inang SARS-CoV-2 use the CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCoV came back to the beginning of the outbreak
Kelelawar Kerrity has the great opportunity to show him a new HCoV.
In this case, CoV Kelelawar works as a HCoV gen lungkang.
Additionally, genetic mutasis and recombinations have also moved the evolution of HCoV and have worked as two important steps in this process.
For example, getting or losing a new protein derivative gene has potentially modified the virus fenotics.
The relationships between SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 are expected to play important in human adapt to human beings because a relative batch virus-SARS-CoV-coV that are found in a series of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the special aspects of removal 29 nukleotida was found on the object that was disfellowshipped at the beginning of the human epidemi.
The riddance of this ORF8 is ORF8a and ORF8b and expected to be an adaptive mutation supporting in the infasi.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a large number of recombining areas in RNA polymerase that depends on RNA.
Rekombination location also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the constant recombination between the many linis was shown in the epidemi MERS-CoV, which happened in the Arab camels in Arab Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination incident has also been observed at other HCoV where HCoV has had recombinated with other coV animals in his nonstructal gen.
Also should be understood that artificial selection can be involved in an inescapable change on virus genome, which is likely affected by the liberation of the semillion pressure, such as the insect systems.
The example of this effect is missing ORF4 complete on the HCoV-229E prototype effect due to removing two nukleotida.
Sementara ORF4 intact can be observed on bat virus and camels that are related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka indicates a single nukleotida side that causes a series of quartifies.
Last, new evolution of HCoV was moved by selekoh pressure in the reservoir.
Lighted Gejala or without symptoms were detected when bate in the CoV infected bat, which shows each other the adaption between CoV and bat.
Kelelawar may have been adapted well with CoV as anatomi and physiology.
For example, malformed on proinflamasi response activation on bat will lower the patologiesic CoVally efisien.
Additionally, a natural killer cell activity in the bat was pressed because of the increase of the regulators of the killer’s natural procurator NKG2/CD94/CD94 and the level of complex molecule expression of his main class I.
Additionally, the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is high from high-last metabolik activity that can push the repplication of CoV and affect the detection by exoribonuklease so that giving pressure to make an insectsecution of virus virus that are highly obsogents when they enter into the new in.
The more patogenic Strain may also be developed through the rekombination, which can cause new protein or protein features to adapt to the inang.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the new three HCoV had just appeared in the last two basewarsa.
CoV is non-paratogenik or causes light symptoms in the invigoir in the invigoir, such as bats and camels.
KoV is a strong application without triggering a powerful inang response.
This is the secret of a cart without symptoms and causing heavy cases on human infections.
Painless Gejala weighs especially because of an innovation innovative responses and a lookin storm, with a deeper lung damage if responses get stronger.
On the contrary, on the coup without the symptoms, the imunt responses have escaped from the replikasi of CoV.
The same strategy to decide imunci responsivity may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Responsive interferon especially strong on bat.
Hence, the interferon of type I, at least the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be beneficial.
Additionally, inflamasom NLRP3 in the frequency frequency.
With this reason, infybi inflamasom NLRP3 with MC950 might be beneficial in the COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2’s public alur will follow the arrival of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the bat-coV beta-CoV shares 95% homology nukleotida with SARS-CoV has been found, some of CoV bat shares 96% nukleotida homologis with SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the musang and other animals at the market were found to carry a virus identified to SARS-CoV, in direct intercessor for SARS-CoV-2 not found.
The most homologing Beta-CoV-conggiling with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that trenggilans may be one of the intercessor or me-CoV trenggiling may give a gen fragmensi at the end of SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although it is still asked, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans deliberately or deliberately.
CoV’s return to the center of attention because the plague of SARS-CoV-2 recently.
The CoV study Studi in the Kelelawar and other animals have changed our persepsi on the importance of the original animalnotic and reservoir of animals for the HCoV on human transmission.
Sangat many evidence show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from bat and transferred to mankind through the intercessor.
Mengingating that SARS-CoV infections from contact between humans and musangs in the wet market, maybe desecrating wet markets and killings all musangs in it that end SARS episodes effectively.
Along with the same reason, trenggilan should be transferred from wet markets to prevent the transmission of zoonotic transmisi, remembering a number of my descendants-CoV-strgiling lines that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth, and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism is transferred to human beings by trenggiling and other mammals are still to be classified in research in the future.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arab camels.
This Unta works as an important transporting tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, skin, and cartoons for local society.
The Arab Unta spread throughout the Middle and Africa.
Therefore, we can't possibly kill all camels to control MERS, as done at the markets of wild animals in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the MERS plague, the comprehensive approach has to be done to develop the vaccine for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection measures.
Before we managed to eliminate this virus, new genotics can appear and cause outbreaks.
He was also told that he would soon change his course.
Especially is CoV bat, who has a potentially potential for petnotics.
There are many possible possibilities for this coV zoonotic to transform and experience recombination, which led to the development of new CoV, which was easier to ditransision and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
Budaya eating wild animals everywhere in the Tiongkok area must be abandoned to reduce contact that is not required of humans and animals.
With the harsh experiences of SARS, U.S.A., and COVID-19, preparation and a better development article should be applied.
Sebenarnya, many viruss have been on this planet since then.
These viruss are in his naturalservoirs until there is an opportunity to preach the good news.
Despite many characteristics of bats of virus penyebaran, mankind’s opportunity to regarding bats and wild animals can be predicted if people die to avoid wild animals.
The Surveilans continue to be done with mammals to understand more about the ecology of CoV and the natural inaccursion, which will prove to be beneficial in preventing human-human transmisi and outbreaks.
In kesimpulannya, the most effective way to prevent virus kebunikis is human beings to keep distance from the reekological reservoir of the animalnotic virus.
SARS-CoV-2 teka-teki teka-teki section has not been found.
First, if the bats of SARS-CoV-2’s ancestion virus to go to trenggiling, conditions when batwars and efficiencing ekologis relungs are important to know.
Seconds, if bat has a more direct role in transmisi into humans, the way man has a deal with bat must be determined.
Third, if there are third mammals that are actually intervenanced, the way the mammals interact with other species, which include humans, bat, and tropics should be explained.
Akhirnya, as many mammals, including pets that might have rented against SARS-CoV-2, well experiment infections and surveylans should be done.
Either Kelelawar, trenggiling, or other mammals, expected that SARS-CoV-2 or that his parents' virus could almost be identified in her natural in the future.
Intensity research research in this field will decipher the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary jalur of animals, by implicationing important importance in control of CIVD-19 and operation on humans.
COVID-19 criteria regnostic "s unexpected" and "sonfirmation" COVID-19 must be done
On February 6, 2020, our team combined quickly counsel for diagnose and renovation of new koronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and becomes a good reference to the environmental worldwide.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a new disease, awareness and knowledge of our increased by advanced research events and plinis practical experiences; therefore, diagnosis and investments are also updated.
On this letter, we answered one of our comments and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "sensentials" and "were confirmed" based on the Diagnosis Guides and impension for CVID-19 (the seventh version of the National Commission) that was released by the National Committee of Tiongkok National Committee.
On December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has led a outbreak, which is now called koronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) and that virus was given the name of the quanaviruse syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) heavy quantrus.
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemi.
Addressing the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide of counsel and a guide has been published directly in the Medical Military Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has been a lot of attention since it was published.
Nevertheless, it is noted that the COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge of our increased research based on more efficient experience and the practical experiences of clinis; therefore, the diagnosis and impetus strategies are also updated.
Examples of Diagnosis and Constraints for COVD-19, released from the Tiongkok National Committee Commission (http://www.ncn.cn.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 21 March 2020, this commission issued seven editions with a number of context have been changed enough.
our Guides are given to the comment from Zhou et al., they introduce a simple scored proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work results add new evidence to our guidance and become a precious reference to this environment worldwide.
our studies support their significant and express our gratitude for the results of their work.
Nevertheless, their work in the same way required renovation based on Diagnosis and Constraints for the latest COVD-19 (e. seventh test) and latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the case intensives memerlukan a combination of epidemiologis descriptions with two klinisions manifestations to make komprehensif analysis, or need to impossibility three efficibility if there is no clear episode history:
epidemiologis: (1) travel history or dwell in the city Wuhan and its surrounding region, or other community in the case COVD-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before a series of syndicate; (2) contact with the SARS-CoV-2 disease case (with a positive nuclear nuclear acid)); (3) contact history of patients with a patient or synthematical news of the city of Wuhan and around the United States, or the last 3th day before the news had been reported in the case between the case between the case (or, or the case).
Clinci Manifestasi klinis: (1) fever and/or synapas symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection feature feature: (3) total calculates the total number of white blood cells indicate the limfosition of normal, down, or reduced to the initial awitan level.
Exposured cases are required to be based on case in case of an unexpected, with one of the evidence patogenic or econology as the following: (1) test a positive pre-time for SARS-CoV-2; (2) persensequency of the entire virus indicates that the new homogenity is known for new coronavirus; (3) the positive for the Igrimian anti-VIGS2 anti-VOV2; or the change of anti-VVVVVV2, in which is also a positive response to the end of the end.
WHY we can see that the real test of a nukleated acid in the samples of pernapas or blood is added to the second January 20, 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The patogenik Detects on blood samples are added to the fourth edition of 2.7 January 2020) and 5th (8 Februari 2020); then, acerology evidence is added to the seventh edition.
This Modification is based on continued research by researchers to find the image of an optimal acid for diagnosis quickly, and samples from the breath channel including blood flow, which increases the availability of various spesiment, and support a positive anti-bodi result into the confirmation of the prophecy.
Also, there are more evidence that we have to remind us of the patients with the synonymous symptoms and with no symptoms.
Thus, the form of an auth al. must be updated because they recommend people without clinis symptoms as "fusiko low".
also, however, the progress of the science system needs to be verified in the prektik and chlinis studis at the coming time.
As a cover, we hope that more directly evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
In the case of the "senseal sensitive" and "sonfirmed", we recommend that we follow and follow the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance as a help.

The Toko-toko in Australia has lowered the limit of toilet purchases per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth store and Coles each other's purchase limit to two and one major transactions in all the stores on the national level.
ALDI also applied the limits of one sir, on Monday.
This limitation was announced as a message in the sand and on the Facebook page of the network.
COVD 19's fear had to be committed in a self-relegation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also overturned toilet purchases for shipping home to one order sir.
This change followed the 4 mends of four comms per transactions that were applied to Woolworths and Coles each at 4 and 5 March.
On the statement of the media on March 8, Coles reported that with the four constraints, "many stores are still out in one hour since the delivery", and calling that request "belum has happened before", while ALD, in a Facebook posting on Tuesday, it says "untrusted".
Last week, according to one of the Woolworths talks instructors.
Kosco Toko Costco in Canberra also membede the amount that was allowed until two weeks ago.
While ALDI made preparations for special Wednesday promosi activities available earlier earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Peritel Peritel Price, said that peritel tried to improve supplies, but the local government limit for the time of transporting truck making it difficult.
As long as suppliers try to meet requests, and a little more specific promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the earlier preparations, some shops cannot have special Wednesdays.
According to a news report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, aritel specialist from University Queensland of Technology, says the store store fills supplies every night.
She stresses that toilet vessels are large things that are so large that the amount of supplies are low and, if it's finished, make many spaces in the shelf-rak until the loss of things gets worse.
Coles and Woolworths esteem [that] if there are many things in the shelf, if there are such products as toilet tubes and tortures that are [dibelit] and there are in large numbers, thepany may be diminatiable, ujar Russel Zimmerman through the News ABC.
The producer of the toilet tubes resuming Siapa yang memberi Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of supply.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Paper Solaris, which makes Sorbent, menekankan them to work 24/7 to keep supplying, according to the news report.com.au.
Domain.com, a estat sebenar site, reported that some property sales offer free toilet tubes to the first lelang cure in Melbourne, when a little lelang was held for the buyer to pass by the weekend Buruh.
Edisi Kamis NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, puts down eight pages meaning for cut and used as a toilet tube.
The Toko-toko literally refused to apply the boundaries, according to the report ABC Australia on March 3, they said that they had not planned to apply the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that the other products also included in high request, including masks, penetrating, dry food, soap dose of tangan, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on a Sunday of supermarket from the British Lanado, Ocado disassociated the buyer of Andres until two sirs filled with 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemi
On Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) specifies the outbreak of COVD-19 — a disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 Comdemi.
Although the word "pandemi" is merely linked to how much disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO records the need to move the government to act:
Of course, all countries can still change this pandemi journey.
If the country is detecting, testing, testing, mengasingkan, and memublikasikan its people as responses, ujar Tedros Adhanom Ghebyesus, Director General WHO.
Our studies are incredibly rewarded because of the level of our preaching and delay, even because of the fearful actions level.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Control Center and Prevention of the United States the United States, this pandmi "belum ever happened sebelumnya."
She said, in a record that CNND published in February, "But influenza influenza, there was no flucture virus that was once torn from its appearance to the global spread of globality."
Scholar Ghebreyesus defines a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemi that has been triggered by koronavirus."
He went on, "and we have never seen arami that can be handled at the same time."
The new status of pandemi followed the decision that the month January says this plague as a world’s magnificence.
Director of the National Society of Allergy and Infedentious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, say about this outbreak, "After this plague, this plague will be worse."
Till Wes, the Press Asciated reports are at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which cause more than 4.600 death.
Pandemi koronavirus 2019-2020 is a pandatory for chronavirus 2019 (COVD-19) who is continue and because of the condition of quanavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The Wabah was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, was specified as a Public Health Health that ran into the world on January 30th, 2020, and was specified as a pandmi on 11 March 2020.
PAGE 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 lands and the history of some 970,000 death.
Sekitar 36000 people have been cured.
Characters of cases fatality may be 4% in Tiongkok, while all around the world starts from 13,04% to 0,08% in New Cellandia.
General Gejala covers fever, rocks, and breathtakes.
Komplications can cover the pneumonia and syndrome of quant breath.
Day from time to time, however, the signs of symptoms are common in general about five days, but they can roll from two to twelve days.
However, no vaccine has yet been known or specific medications.
The primary treatment is a Simptomatic therapy and suportive. preventive actions that are recommended meliputis washing, closing mouths, keeping distances from other people, and monitoring and monitoring and supplying private pages for those expected to be infected.
Otorities around the world have been consulted by the exertion of traveling, carantina, at night, and at work a dangerous position, and the cover of facilities.
These Pandemis have led to severe global economic disorders, delaying or religious, religious, religious registration, and vast retribution has led to panic purchases.
School and university have been closed well at the national and local level of 193 countries, which affects about 99,4 percent of the students around the world.
Misinformation on this virus has spread spread fromng and there are phenomobia incidents and discrimination against Tionghoa, people with descendants of the East and Southeast Asia, and those from the area of the virus that are significant.
According to travels reduction and heavy industrial closing, air pollution and carbon emissions menurun.
Health organise in Wuhan, Tiongkok (ibu proinsi Hubei), melaporkan pneumonia case klaster by reason of the 31 December 2019 and the investigation was performed at the beginning of January 2020.
Those sensitive Kasussuss are related to the Huananan Sea Food market and therefore the virus was expected to have the original animalnotic origin.
The virus that causes outbreaks to be called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus found and debated with the bat chronavirus, the coronavirus tenggil, and SARS-CoV.
Among the early cases clasters reported on December 2019, two-per thirds have something to do with that market.
On March 13, 2020, an unpredicted report from China Selatan Morning Post estimated that a case we could be considered to 17 November 20,19, at the age of 55 years from the Hubei Province, was likely the first.
There may be a large number of cases that are not reported, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
PAGE 26 Februari, a relatively small number of cases reported among the young ones, with 19 - year - old men down to form 2,4% cases throughout the world.
The Kasus is referring to the number of people who have been tested by CVID-19 and the results of their test have been confirmed positively based on official protocols.
Sehingga 23 Mac, there are no countries to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries have arranged official policy not to test people with light symptoms, such as Italian, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, from January 23, 86% of CIVD-19 was not detected, and that this infection that this is not documented is the source of infections for 79% of the documentation.
A statistic analysis published on 30 March estimated that infection numbers in Italy are greater than the case reported.
The early estimate of the basic reproduction (R0) number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the United States’s Control and Prevention Center concluded that the number was probably 5,7.
Most of the CVID-19 sufferers are recovering.
For those who are not cured, the time since symptoms of symptoms and death between 6 and 41 days with the most common one, 14 days.
Dari 10 April 2020, about 97000 death is associated with COVID-19.
On Tiongkok, to February 5th, some 80% of death occurs in over 60 years and 75% has a health disorder that has already existed, which encompasses cardiovaskular and diabetes disease.
Despite the depths of fatality, the COVD-19 may have been much higher, since official numbers may not have left the dead without a test, for example, at home in the hospital, at the hospital of treatment, etc.
Parsial Data from Italy found that the total number of deaths during the environment exceeded the official COVID's death calculation with a 4-5 factor.
A woman’s talker for the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths being spoken] was lower than the actual numbers", a statement that was strengthened by a non-miah report about calculations too low in the United States.
The first death outside the coastal Tiongkok occurred on February 1, the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was France on February 14, February 14, a.
Till February 28th, beyond the Tiongkok land, more than the cellusin of death is recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Sehingga 13 March, more than 40 different countries and the territorial areas have reported death, at every continent, except Antarctica, in general, some measurement is used to count mortality.
These numbers vary according to the area and limit of time, and are influenced by the number of testing, health treatments, neglecting options, time since the first outbreak, and population character such as age, deep, and health.
statistics Johns Hopkins University, kematian rasios between cases globally are 6,0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number of numbers vary according to the territory.
On Tiongkok, death rasios description of a case down from 17,3% (for people with a total of a 1-10 January 2020) to 0,7% (for people with a series of symptoms after February 1 February 2020). Other measures include cases fatality (CFR), which reflects the percent of those who died of certain disease, and fatal infections, which reflected by the percent of disease (IFR), the percent of disease (dignosis and dyedinalinalice).
This statistics are not bound by time and by following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academy has been trying to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
Pusat untuk University Medicine-Based Medicine of Oxford memperkirakan infection fatality to cover the entire environment between 0,1% and 0,39%.
On the top of this estimate, this is a way by the result of the first acact testing for CVID-19 in Germany and a statistic understanding that affects the impact of the baptism of CFR estimate.
WHO menegaskan bahawa this pandemi can be handled.
As far as the end of this plague is subtle and may be different from the location.
Maciej Boni of the University State Penn state states: “In spite of control, infections often exist and then begin to fall down when the disease is out of an openang.
But at this time, it may not be possible to make a logical projection this time of the end. "
The medical adviser of the Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan said that “the plague might end June ” if the whole country can be promoted to follow the suggestions on steps to stop the spread of virus.
Pado March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine points out that SRS-CoV-2 "will leave, perhaps until one or two years."
The University of Imperial University according to the dealings that was led by Neil Ferguson, physical bounds and other steps will be required " sehingga the vaccine is available (ke possible 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of the University Vanderbilt says: “I feel that this coronavirus may be very easy to ditransision, can disappear all of it" and this disease "will turn into season disease, which comes back each year."
Recurrence Virulent will depend on the immune of the group and mutation level.
Gejala COVID-19 can be considered irrespective and infected people without symptoms.
The most common gejalas are fever (88%) and dry rocks (68%).
The less common Gejala meliputis kelelahan, the production of scum pernapas (flegma), missing the breath of breath, the pain and the pain of the joints, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the headaches, the headaches, the hemropic, hemticosis, or the sianosis.
The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are compiling emergency symptoms with disabling problems of breathing, emotional pain or emotional pain, sudden despondentity, persecution, and lips; medical attention soon to the surface of this disease can soon be more severe. Disease may become pneumonia, severe abs, synthesis, sine, and death.
Those who are infected may be asimtomatic, which is, without a clinical symptoms, but with the results that confirms infections, researchers suggest that those who are contacted with infected should be kept close to the infected people.
Tionghoa people calculated asimtomatic rasios from a few to 44%.
Periode inkubation (at between infection and symptoms) biasanya corresponding between 1 and 14 days, at most commonly 5 days. For example, the number of CIVD-19, which loses the beginning of 30%, and then is reduced to 15%.
The details of the way this disease is still being spread.
COVID-19 is believed in a close contact time and via a small droplet that was produced when cough, pecking, or speaking; close contact is a contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that unstoppable stones could cause 4,5 meters (15 m) to 82 feet (27 ft).
Para penyelidiks may also be able to draw from a small droplet which lasts longer in air and produced when speaking. Droplets of speech can also be produced when breathing, including while speaking, although these viruss are commonly not spoken through air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or the nose of the person in the closet, or it may be melt into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubtion and resusiate lung hearts (RJP), could create pertapas clerks of change into aerosol and then spread through the air.
During the same time, Services can happen when someone touches the most prominent surface, including skin, and touched eye, nose, and mouth.
Despite the concerns that a virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed in low.
The Tiongkok government menyokong possible transmisi SARS-CoV-2 fekal-oral. Virus the most infected in the first three days after symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms look and on more disease stages.
People give positive tests to three days before symptomswitness, which signal transmisi may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Just a few reports of the asimtomatic case confirmated by the lab, but the asimtomatic expression has been identified by some countries when contacting research.
The Central Center of Disease and European Disease Control (ECC) stated that although it was not as clear as easy as this disease was spread, one common people infected two to three others.
Specially, viruss have been detected to three days in plastic (polipropilen) and carritoons 304, one day on kardus, and more than four hours on copper.
This, however, has its vocabulary depended on frequency and temperatures, and other pets have tested positive CVID-19.
Gentle has no evidence that animals can betray a virus to humans, even though English authorities suggest to wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may already touch people who are infected.
Coronavirus artatic syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first being distributed from three pneumonia sufferers related to the condition of a quant disease disease in Wuhan.
All of the features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just been associated with coronavirus in the universe.
Virus thought he had an origin of zoonotic.
Genetic Analisiss reveal that the coronavirus genetically terklastered with Genetic genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (basis of B) together with two ostour downloads.
This virus has a similar role in the entire genome with other bat chronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
On February 2020, researcher Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome group between a dozen virus and human virus.
Until now, the whole genome found at least 92% genetic material common between the congestion koronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tenggiling is inang of SARS-CoV-2.
The transformation by the virus can be diagnosed with temporary symptoms, but confirmations are eventually performed through the rekripsi polimerion chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on a infected text or embarrass the CT.
A study that compares between PCR and CT in Wuhan menunjukkan that CT signifially more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many flowing features that are overlapd with pneumonia and other disease process.
On March 2020, the American College of Radology recommends "CT cannot be used for filtering or as the first test of lini in CVID-19. "
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which is first distributed on January 17th.
tests of testing using a polimerase chain reaction transcryption bothtime and real-time (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be performed on a rescuing sample or blood.
The common results are available in just a few hours till a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasof filter usap, but a bulk of throats can also be used.
On April 6, 2020, these ecserology tests have proved to be quite accurate to agree with the use of it in general.
U.S.A., technologies developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, just by the laboratorium specified.
The Karakteristic feature of radiography and tomography is computed (CT) on people who are symtomaticallyk includes asimetry glass environmental opasity and no pleura efusi.
The Italian Radiology Society is planning an international missile data for the finding of an imageing on the confirmed case.
Because the dam is overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, scistering without confirmation PCR has limited spesifises in identify CIVID-19.
A big research in Tiongkok compares the result of CT chests with PCR and shows that despite less specific for infections, the growth is faster and more sensitive until it is recommended to be considered as a filter tool in the epidemi region.
artificial intelligence neural neural networks have been developed to detect the system’s imageic feature with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disease might include caring for a good personal cleanness, wash hands, avoid touching an eye, nose, or mouth before washing, and use tubes when it calib or pecks and immediately removesues to the trash.
A person who may have been infected is recommended to use a surgeon’s mask in a public place.
physic barriers are also recommended to prevent resuming.
But the virus has reached the global scale of the world.
This tells us that the virus has spread in society, and some members of the community don't know where or how they are infected. health treatment treatment treatments that are likely to be infected with people who are likely to be infected with the standard prevention, contact control actions, and eye prevention actions. The contact control of the body is a vital step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further growth.
The use of the data from the phone by the government for this purpose has led to personal problems, to exit a statement from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations that call out the surveylans such a thing.
Biseluler apps have been implemented or implemented to be used willingly, and on April 7, 2020, over a group of experts working private friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance of the user to another cell phone.
Further, users will receive a message if they are nearing someone who tests positively to CVID-19. discrimination about how to prevent infection; for example, feed noses and celebrities with influential drugs.
Although there is no COVID-19 vaccine, many organizations are working to develop it.
washeding hands were urged to restrain the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after respiring noses, rocks, or slings.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus was murdered by a household soap that broke its shield.
Moreover, CDC recommends the use of alcoholic beverages with the contents of alcohol 60% based on volumes when soap and water are not available.
SIAPA menggalakkan people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before wash tangan.
The Faces can be developed using a number of late (infectant displays for the surface of the countryt), including streanol 62 (1991%, isopropanol 50–100%, hipoklorit natrium 0,1%, hydroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2,5%.
Other Larouutan, like chlorida benzalkonium and chlorecessidin glunat, kurang effective.
CDC recommends that if there are any unexpected COVID case or confirmed in the public facility, such as the office or the landing of the children, all areas such as the office, the bathroom, the public area, the electronic tool is together like tablet, touch screens, keyboards, control remotes, and ATM machines that have to be used by the sufferer, should be diagnosed.
Health Organization recommends that a person hides his mouth and their noses with his syneces, or use garpus when he is plowing or sling, and then immediately removes the helms.
Masker surgeons were recommended for those who might have been infected with the masks could limit the volume and distances of expirators that were spread while talking, kissing, and cough.
WHO has given instructions about the time and the style of masker’s clothes.
Menurut Stephen Griffin, a virologian at the University of Leeds, “Memakai masker's ability to reduce the tendency to touch their faces with unconditional hands, which is also the primary source.”Masker is also recommended to be used by people who are in care of this disease.
WHO recommends the use of the masker's use of healthy people just if they risked high, such as those taking the lead in CVD-19, although WHO also admits that wearing the mask can help help keep people touch their face.
Some countries have already begun to push the use of masker to society.
U.S.A., CDC recommends the use of nonmedic face masks made from kain. Pick specificly recommends the use of medical masker used once to a healthy society, especially when near (1 m) or less) people.
Hong Kong recommends the use of a surgeon’s mask when using common transportation or living in an crowd.
Thailand’s health Office encourages people to make kain masks at home and wash them every day.
Republic of Ceko and Slovakia forbids people to go out to public without wearing masks or cover their noses and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all his citizens to wear a face mask when going to the public to protect themselves and others.
State of Austria required that everyone enters the toserba to wear face masks.
Jehu asked all his citizens to wear their face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million maskers per day since March, has held train passengers and buses wearing face masks per April.
Panama menetapkans the use of face maskers every time out of the house, and recommends the designer’s facet for those who cannot buy face masker.
The face masker is also used as large in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
The social debilitation (which is also called physical debilitation) is a act of infection operation that is intended to slow down the spread of disease by minimizing contact near individuals.
Kosod social delimiter encompasses karantina; travelouts; and closing schools, jobs, stadiums, theaters, or budget center.
People can apply social barrier methods to stay at home, limiting their journeys, avoid areas, use greeting without any contact, and safeguarding physical distance from others.
Today, many governments have a Scriptural requirement or scanning social barriers in the region where outbreaks are affected.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. government bodies and health organizations are quickly reduced, from 250 people (if there are no known CIVD-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to be 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, German forbids meetings in the public area that involve more than two people.
The use of the term " social borders" affects people that people must socially separate themselves and that they do not force people to remain associated with others in alternative ways. Some of the authority has led out sexual health counsel to use during the time of the environment.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with those who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Employan Isolasis were kept at home recommended for those who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and expected to be infected.
Those health members have removed detailed instructions for the correct self-control, and many governments have mandatory or recommendating karantina for the entire population living in the region where they are dealt with.
The most strict man’s instruction in the carantina is released to those with a high - risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and recently traveled to countries or region by the witnessing of CVID-19, which was suggested to have their first 14 days of human life.
The strategy in the outbreak operation is an impaired or supresi, as well as mitigasi.
The need for a cure is done at the beginning of the outbreak and is intended to track and promote the infected people and do other steps for infections and vaccines that are intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to block the disease, the effort continues to move to mitigasi level: these steps are taken to slow down the penyebaran and reduce its impact on health care and society.
Investigating the action and mi tigacies can be done at the same time.
Supresi’s Supretion requires more contremity steps to reverse the environment by reduceing basic reproduction rates to less than 1.
This issue lowers the risk of control on health care and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatment.
The interpolation Intervenation of non-zero to handle outbreaks covering individuals' actions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and karantines; step-steps that are directed for physical barriers, such as closing schools and removing mass meetings; society’s direction to motivate these kinds of marriages and participates in this kind of intervenation; and other steps in the environment, such as the surface of the environment. other acts that are intended to be performed in the encirclosures of the internation of the city, such as the most real plague and the city’s.
other countries also apply various steps that are intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea memperkenalkan massal and carantina filters, and also warnings about infected people’s movements.
Singapore gives financial support to infected people who do their own carantina and wear large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the face masker production and menghukum medical supplies. Simulation of British and United States menunjukkan that mitigasi (per slow, but did not stop preaching epidemi) and supresi (verting epidemi growth).
Optimization policy can reduce the peaks of the request for health care to 2/3 and death to one another, but still hundreds of thousands of death and the health systems are maintained.
Supression may be selected, but it is necessary to be held during the virus is still in human population (or until this is the first to reach), because if it is not, the expression would quickly shift back when the supresi steps are recommended.
Long - term Intervensi in order to push pandemis membawa an impact on social and economic.

lab testings for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus including methods that detects the existence of virus and that detects the antibodies that are produced as responses to infection.
The existence of a virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This testing is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This test is used to confirm new infections or still active.
The antibodi Detect (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveyion.
antibodi tests indicate that the number of people who are already infected, including those whose symptoms are too light to report or who have no symptoms.
The human nature of the tyrant disease and the thickness of the group in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, there are no countries with data andal about virus areas in the population.
Sehingga 23 Mac, there are no countries to test more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests that have been done in countries.
This variation may also affect the signifies of the case fatality reported, which may have been counted too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of polymerase transcryption real-time (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on samples of whatever is available with various methods, including nasof filters or sample sputum.
Generally, the results are available in just a few hours and two days.
RT-PCR test performed on a neckbat can only be included in the first week of disease.
But the virus will soon disappear in the throat as long as it continues to appear in the lung.
As an alternative, for the infected person in the second week, the sample material can be taken from a deep breath channel by using a bronze or material that was issued through cough (sputum) can be used.
Among the early PCR test was developed in Chari Tamwan, Berlin, in January 2020, using transkripsi politions reactions back to real-time (rRT-PCR), and forms at least 250.000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British England also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Koreaships of Kogenebiotech develops a sARS-CoV-2 detector PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
This device searched for the gene "E" that all my members of the coronavirus, and the permanent RdRp genes for SARS-CoV-2. In Tiongkok, the BGI Group is one of the first company to receive an emergency usage of the PARS-CoV2 National Factation for PARS CRRS. In the United States, the United States, the Department and PDRRRRPD (UDI-Vistinal-S2 CI) Department of the United States, the United States, the U.S.C.
Genetics one of three tests on old versions of the study made no convincing because of the reagen error, and the number of testes in CDC in restricted Atlanta; this can result in less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests of testing using two components are considered unrecognizable to February 28, 2020, and then the laboratorium of the state and the local laboratory was allowed to do testing.
This test was set up by the Body of Obat and the U.S. Activation of the United States U.S.A., based on the U.S. Laboratorium, U.S.A., started testing at awal March 2020.
SOME 1:5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVD-19 test of RT-PCR on national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnosticsss made a CVID-19 test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
THE TIBRATY: No quantity boundaries are announced; the gathering and the experimental processes must be done according to the condition of the CDC.
IN Russia, test COVID-19 developed and was produced by the National Research Center of Virology and Bioteknology V centuries.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveilans in Healths, on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported a test to detect CVID-19’s infection.
On March 19, 2020, FDA released emergency usage (EUA) to Abbott Laborators to test on m2000 Abbott; FDA previously released the same authority to Hologyc, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from FDA for testing which would take about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses an associational acid technature of nucleat isotermal non PCR.
Because there is no need for a series of temperature pengganti cycles, this method can give positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
In the meantime, there are some 2,000 machines in the United States and Abbott relating to increase production to produce 500,000 test per day. Tests use antibodi monoklonal antibodily tileokapsid proteins (protein N) new koronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with a promise can give success in 15 to 20 minutes like a fast influenza test.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that "the toraks image has a small diagnostic value at the beginning of the stage, during the meeting of CT [komputedography] may already be present before a series of symptoms."
Special Fiturs on CT including multiglass multilobar opasity when well with perifer distribution, asimetry, and postterior.
Subpleura Dominasi, paving gila, and konsolidation consisted of disease.
Bidding in Wuhan, a study that compares the PCR with CT at the current pandemi point reveals that CT signively more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many interpolating features of the spawns overlasses with pneumonia and other diseases.
On March 2020, the American College of Radology recommends "CT not to be used for filters or as the first lini test in CVID-19. " In March 2020, CDC recommendation PCR for early filters.
Part of the response to infection is an antibodi form that includes IgM and IgG.
This article can be used to detect infections on individuals since about 7 days after symptoms have beenwitness, to determine immunity about disease, and in the surveylans can be performed in central laboratorium (CLT) or with the testing-of-care (PoCT).
The system’s automated with high results in many klinis laboratoriums will be able to do this inspection, but its preparation will depend on the production rate for each system.
Bifer darah spesimen for CLT, commonly used for the CLT, despite the attack of spesimen can be used to follow the imun response.
Dear PoCT, most likely it is used by a perifer blood spesimen that are obtained through skin tubes.
Unlike the methods PCR, extraksi can not be required before a checkup, on March 26, 2020, FDA mentioned 29 agency that provides notifications about the agensis just as needed and therefore it is now able to promote their antibodi test.
On 7 April 2020, only a test that was approved by the FDA based on an emergency usage otorisasiment. at March 2020, Euroimmun Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostiks got a deal for their devices that can detect antibodi IgG and IgA virus in blood samples.
His testing capasity takes place to some hundred samples within a few hours, so much faster than the convention of convention for the virus RNA.
In the early April of England, Antibodi generals usually detected 14 days after infections.
Hong Kong set up a scheme for unexpected patients to stay at home, "departemen of emergencys will give spesimen funds to patients," they send them back in a few seconds later. The British NHS reported that NHS is pioneering in the home of a case testibility so that the risk of a patient if they come to the hospital or if they come to the hospital.
Upon March 2, March, Association of Statutory Health of the German Physicians said that Germany had a kapasity about 12.000 test per day in the abduction and 10.700 testibility have been performed in the previous week.

On March 19, adare test was offered in several large cities.
On 26 Mac 2020, the number of tests done in Germany was unknown because only positive results are reported.
A first laboratorium survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/20201 sample (6,9%) tested for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed a sample of 64 patients to test samples, to test samples from 64 patients, and then only a positive samples. Inveling samples, 2.000 m (2.5 m) are said to be used to open in more languages, "Mativ400" or more than 2000 m (500 km).
With the construction of its construction, the BGI Wang Wang will be guarded and eating 5 days, modlans indicate that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and related cost for carantina would be twice as much as this testing capacity was not available.
Laboratorium Wuhan was soon followed by the laboratorium Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, at total 12 cities throughout Tiongkok.
Biddings per 4 March 2020, total of its daily capacity of 500,000 test per day, desain multiple open sources of open sources of the Origami Assays can test as much as 1.222 patient samples to CVID-19 by using 93 orang checkups. This balanced desain can be run in small laboratory without robotic birth aid.
Till March, kekurangan and sufficient reagen have been enslaved for mass testing in European Union, U.S.A., and U.S.A.
In this way, a number of researchers tried to exploit the sample preplost protocols that involved sample warminges at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing.
This matter is reached through the variation of the ancient test and the laboratorium purchases of massal populations from Grup 42 and BGI (formed on emergency detectorium "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
The building in 14 days, this laboratorium was able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratorium that has this scale outside the Tiongkok.
Along with the procession recipes that target various types of chronavirus genetic profiles are developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
World Health Organization adopts a prescription for the production of test tools that are sent to countries with lower income without resources to develop themselves.
The German Recept was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Control Center are not available to 28 January so that slowing down the tests available in the United States.
At the same time, experts say that the widespread testing in South Korea allows to reduce the preaching of the new koronavirus.
aspects of testing, most in private sector laboratorium, built in a few years by South Korea government.
IN 16 March, the World Health Organization announced the increase of testing program as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 redemi, a high request for testing because of widespread virus witnessing causes hundreds of thousands of testing to wait in the private laboratorium, and the supply of the mariap and the chemical reagen.
On March 2020, Tiongkok reported an amatural problem on their test device.
The U.S.A. in the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC has "cat", the government then removes the edge of the bereokrasi that prevents testing by private. Spanish bought te test from the Shenzhen Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that its outcome was not accurate.
The company explains that the results are not true may have been the result of failures to collect samples or to use test tools correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull the equipment that gave truth, and replace it with other tests provided by Shenzhen Bioasy.80% test tools bought the Ceko Republic from Tiongkok with an incorrect result.
The Prime Minister Matoviı suggested that this test tool was cast into the river Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkey Health Health Health Department say that Turkey’s test device had a high level of sin in Tiongkok, and they didn't have "unchene". Inggris, the Russians bought 3,5 million tests from Tiongkok, but at the beginning of 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
The tests, followed by the positive and tracking person who contacts positive SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end.
The Penelitian who works in the city of V asking Italy, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, perform two rounds of testing at all populations that are over 3.400 people, with a distance about 10 days.
SOME than half of the positive people who have a positive self - examination do not have symptoms, and all the cases found inkarantine.
On the way to this community, new infections are nothing at all.
With a aggressive contact tracking, travel limiting in, testing, and carrantina, coronavirus panding 2020 in Singapore developed much longer than any of these developed countries, even without extrem barriers, such as the disposing of restaurant and ritel company.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore suggested that residents live at home on March 28, but schools are opened back on time after a vacation on March 23th.
Some other countries also deal with pandemiks with aggressive contact tracking, bans of travel in, testing, and carantina, but with no more aggressive territory karantina, such as Islandia and South Korea.
A statistic study found that countries who tested more, relative to the number of death, had a much lower fatality of cases, perhaps because these countries could detect those who own light symptoms or without symptoms.
REMINDING that countries do not have a testive capacity, and national laboratorium with limited CIVD-19 experiences, send five first positive sample CIVD-19 and ten first negative samples to one of the 16 laboratorium references to the confirmation.
IN 16 reference laboratorium, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In this following chart, the column "%s" test testibility positive results are influenced by the policy of the country’s testing policy.
The State that tests only those who are hospitalized will have % positive results above countries that test all citizens, whether they prove symptoms or not, with the same factor.
washed hands, called hygiene, was the act of cleaning of a man’s hand designed to remove unclean, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
washed hands with soap consistently at certain times during the day, prevents many diseases, such as diare and kolera, which is spoken through the fecal-oral routes.
People can also intimidate physical disease, such as influenza or cellesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
Lima seconds critical all day is important to wash hands with soap: Before and after buanging large water, after cleaning a son's ass or changing the popoks, before eating and after preparing foods or washing meats, fish, or unggas raw.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ashes, and the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, while, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for the sick.
After replacing popoks or cleaning a child who had just used toilets.
After he cleaned his nose, cough, or solid.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
The clean of medical hands are enthused to the precinct cleaner of medical procedures.
washed hands before giving medicine or medical treatments can prevent or reduce disease.
The primary medical purpose for washing was to cleanse the hands of patogen (thirs, virus, or microorganism that can cause disease) and chemicals that could lead to dangers or illness.
This is especially important for those who deal with food or work in the fields of medicine, but it is also a important practition for the public.
washeding hands has a lot of health benefits, including minimizing the influenza penyebaran, korona virus, and other infections; preventing the bad diares; reduce renapas infections;
dahs and reduces a baby mortality to a copy of the house.
The study that was done in 2013 shows that the initial increase in washing hands can improve the balita child’s height.
In developing countries, the number of children’s mortality due to physical disease and diares can be reduced by introduceing a simple behavior change, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the number of mortality due to the disease to nearly 50%.
Intervensi, who encouraged to wash up, could reduce dires case until around the likega; this intervensi could be done by providing clean water in a low - product area.
Literature 48% cases reduction can be associated with washing hands with soap. washing hands with soapse is the only way that is most effective and cheap to prevent diare and quantib channel infections (ISPA), as a subcondition behavior performed in the house, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the major ISPA, is the cause of one balita child's death; this disease causes some 1,8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia menyebabkan hampir 3,5 million children each year.
Menurut UNICEF, make hands washing with soap before eating and after using toilets to be used to save more lives of vaccines or whatever medical actions, and reduce the death of almost half and death due to the quantity channel infections.
washeding hands is often combined with other snitasis actions as part of the water program, sanitasi, and cleanness (WASH).
washeding hands also protects themselves from the shrouds that are tied through physical contact.
The small side effects washed were the washing of hands which are often performed can cause skin damage to the skin drying.
The study study that was accomplished in 2012 in Denmark discovered that washing hands can cause the condition of gatal and intersect skin, known as the eximistency of hand or hand dermatis, which had largely happened among the health officers.
washeding hands too often is also seen as one of the obsesif-compulsive disorders (OCD).
On the other hand, there are five days when washing their hands with soaps were important to reduce fecultual disease, which was before and after using toilets (sa small water), after cleaning up a child's ass ass, before the child cuts off, before eating and during/diskinging food or planting meat, fish, or unggas raw.
The other important time in order to apply the correct washing technique to prevent diseases from disemaking is before and after caring for wounds; after beating, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal shit or dealing with animals; and after touching the trash.
In many lands, washing hands with soap still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries found that the average 38,7% tangga house preplanted hands with soap. A study study in 2014 indicated that the Saudi Arabs had the highest level with 97 percent; the United States was about to be at the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the low level of the low level of the year with 23 percent. Now there are some changes in the behavior of interaction for washing their own behavior in critical hands at the critical hands. The average of the students in the country has been defined in the country’s presence of one of the country’s country’s developing behavior.
The fundamental Health Care program that applies to the Educational Department in the Philippines is a good example of action to support your children’s health and education.
Professional feeds twice a year, added by washing hands every day with soap, and tiring teeth every day with fluorida, is the core of this national program.
The program was also applied in Indonesia.
microorganism cleaning from skin is reinforced with the addition of soap or deteren to water.
Soap utama work and deternation are reduceing barriers to unemployment and increase late energy.
The water is just an unefisien cleaner because of the fat and protein, which is an organic organic component, which is not easy to keep in the water.
That challenge, as well as fat and proteins, was helped by sufficient flow of water.
Sabun dense, due to its return quality, may contain the bacteria which were previously produced from their use.
A small number of studis who examine bakteria transfers from the soap concluded that evaporation could not have happened because of the combined bacteria received by busa.
Nevertheless, the CDC keeps saying, "The fluid flows that he releases from the dough without touching his hand is more appealing."
The Sabun a suddenkeri was greatly encouraged to aware of health society.
Until now, there are no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfactions are better for an antibiotic organism that holds antibiotion in the universe.
Nevertheless, antibakteri sabunes contain common anomaly agents, such as triklos, who have a list of vast strengths of organisms.
So although the antibiotik pressure is not targeted by antibakteri soap, this soap may not be visible.
addition to the surfact and skin armory, advanced formulasi can contain an asam (aset, asam askort, asam laktat) as a pH, asam benzot acid as an active antimikroba, and skin conditioner (liaya, putsaroa, permit), Bulture an artifact of Fakulturesa. A finitorial analysis of the University of kecotstical University shows that the social artifacts are the most effective use of the artifacts and the artifacts.
The warm water water is so comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Biakteri grows faster at the temperature (37 °C).
The warm water water is more effective than the cold water is covered in the removal of natural oil that holds shit and bacteria.
Yet, go back with confidence to many people, scientific studys indicate that warm water uses do not have the effect in reduceing the amount of microbes in the hand.

The danger control of the work where the COVD-19 is a security mythology and health medical treatment of danger using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Supplies of danger at work and tasks depend on work locations, which are based on display risks, level of disease in society, and the risk of each individual workers who may be telecommunited by CVID-19.
Privacy According to the Security administration and Health of the U.H.A., a low - security display job has a minimum number of jobs with public and other employees; for this job, for this job, served as a basis infection steps, which includes washing hands, motivates workers to live in houses if sick, ethice ethical ethics, and perform routine environments.

This group includes the workers who have contact with generals, such as at school, working environments with high population density, and high volume threads.
Vigilance power for this group, besides basic infection steps, includes ventilation using high efisiensi air saransion, protectors against art, and provide protection tools when met with CVID-19.
OSHA considers health energy and body rooms that are referred to or expected to suffer from high-level COVID-19 risks, which increases the risk of display if the worker works an aerosol procedure on, or taking or handling the spesimen of the unknown, or expected suffers from CVID-19.
A dangerous operation that suits this worker includes technical operation, such as negative ventilation space, and self - control tool that suits a job’s job.

The techniques for these groups are also contained high efisions, including high hyisienity filters, increase the vention rates, installing physical barriers, and installing physical barriers such as stockings, and installing windows for drivers to the services and businesses that work in order to keep in the field, in which the local territory, in which the local community’sequalities that have to dis ability to dise, in order to disavenovate, in order to dise and reestsecutibility, in order to increase as well as they may have to increase as well as well as they may have to reduce, the ability to reduce, the risksolute, the artifibility of the artwork, the artwork work, the artworkworkworkworkworkwork, and the artworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkwork work, and replication and the artworkworkworkworkworkworkworkwork that often be used with the artworkwork, the artwork; in the projectal, the artifed, the artifed, the artifies that often the artifies, the least to reduces to reduces to reduces to reduces to reduces to puts, the artifed, the artwork, the artifies, the artwork, the artwork, or to put, the ability, the artwork, the artwork, the artworkwork, the most, the artwork, the artworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkwork, the least, the least for the art, the art, the art, the least, the least, the most, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the artsos, the artworks, the art, the art, the art, the least to puts, the least to puts, the ability, the arts, the arts, the arts, the ability, the ability, the ability, the ability to puts, the ability to puts, the ability, the ability to puts, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the least, the ability, the least, the project, the project, the ability that often, the attention to use, the physical, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the attention, the physicalwork, the development, the development, the artworkworkworkwork on, the artwork that the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the arts, the art, the arts, the arts, the physical, the art, the arts, the arts, the arts, the art, the project, the arts, the arts, the least, the coan, the coan, the least in the least in the least, the project, the project, the least, the least, the least, the art, and the least, the art, the least, the least, the least, the art, the least, the art, the more often, the art, the art, the art, the likely, the least, the likely in the least, the artworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkworkwork that the artworkworkwork
The workers in this risk group rarely require respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, the right control of the work and other passengers is involved in removing someone who is sick from another person by six feet, pointing out a cabin to care for a sick person, and offering a face mask for a sick person or asking him to shut down his mouth and noses with tas when heks or stuny.
You will have to wear a glove of medical gloves once while caring for a sick fellow traveler or touch a body cairan or a surface that is encircled and may have other protection tools if a sick fellow traveler has a fever, a stone continues, or a constant struggle of breathing.
Hands rings and other items should be banished in lifeous dangers, and surfaces must be cleansed and diagnosed after them. For commercial voyages, including pesiar ships and other passengers, risk treatments include delaying their journeys if sick, removing themselves, and informing the medical centers on the ship immediately if someone has been injured or other symptoms on the ship.
The idea is, however, medical treatments are performed in the cabin of people who are promoted in the community, for school and child development facility, CDC recommends short-term closing to clean or discinct if the infected person had ever been in the school building.
If there is conversation among the people at a minimum level to the current, social deviation strategies can be applied, which includes: cancelsing field visits, meeting groups, such as physical education, sound-separator class, or eating at the café, raises distance between the table and the presence of the destination, the intersectation of the meeting, and use a separate health location for the children to be like the flu.
If there is a high - standard conversation in the local society, beside social deterioration strategies, extending to school covers can be considered for legal enforcement officers who perform daily activities, the risk of getting low by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to make contact with those who are confirmed or expected CVID-19 is recommended to follow the same direction as emergency medical technician, including using proper protection tools.
If a close contact occurred during the arrest, the workers had to clear and throughdated the belt and task equipment before being used back by a thirteent or lap of the household cleaning procedures and following standard operating procedures to handle and remove former APD and to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers health energy and certain morgues that are at a risk of view or very high.
The risk of display risking high - cost involved health care, support, laboratorium, and medical transporting energy that is exposed to patients known or expected CVID-19.
This job would be high - risked if the workers did aerosol produce procedures on, or taking or handling spesimen from, patients known or expected CVID-19.
Prosedurs produce anerosool cover intubs intubation, kocib induksi procedures, bronkoscopei, some procedures and teeth checks, or any invasif spesimen.
The work of a corpse room risked a high-separated display covers the body of a known man or expected the case of CVID-19 in death; this job would be risked as well as the display if the workers were doing autopsy. Additional techniques to this group include a disassociated space for a patient known or expected CVID-19, which was included when the procedure of arosol.
Specially negative stress Ventilation might be appropriate in some health carets and morgues.
The Spesimen must be handled with Biological Security Preventure actions
With regard to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who came to separate themselves into a different waiting room based on the case of COVD-19.
The U.S.A. in the United States, filtering respirator N95 approved NIOSH or better be used in the context of the wording program and comprehensives that include compatibility, training, and medical checks.
Other type of respirators can provide a greater protection and increase the worker’s balance. WHO does not recommend a cover or cover it all because CVID-19 is a renapas disease and is not added through the body cairan.
WHO simply recommends a surgeon masker to screening officers on the incoming point.
Cofferosol producer procedures, surgeons, pelindung glasses, or face shields, treats, or carry patients without aerosol produce procedures, WHO recommends the masks, surgeons, or the back of an eye.
sekiranya aerosol produce procedure dilakukan, bedah masker is replaced by respirator N95 or FFP2.
Mengingating that supplying the APD is not enough throughout the world, WHO recommends the needs of the APD via remote medical services, physical barriers such as windows are viewed, with only people involved in immediate care can enter the room with CIVD-19 patients, using only APD that are required for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without taking care of a lot of patient with a lot of diagnosis, and monitoring the U.PD.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Offering burdens and preparing the future
TANGGAL/WELITU EXPERIENCE: 14 Mac 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No safe rights
We found ourselves in this extraordinary situation this month.
Epidemi CVID-19 is the thing that makes the human struggles clearly in global and the responsibilities we have each other.
The same job, the construction of the global community, which is the heart of the organization.
Friendship and concern we have witnessed among all fellow workers through emails, calls, and conversations are remarkable human beings, which we are lucky enough to work with them.
my gratitude and my proudness are not limited to mention you as a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of what it means to the world right now to access Wikipedia and how much this is a powerful symbol of this important resource to remain available for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site remains running, help pay for our partner, or help keep our community security safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when it's not just what we're doing, but how we do it will make an impact to the world.
Since the importance of this mission and your role in it will make some important adjustments in the way we work together, which will start next week.
Adapting to our work and schedules
As mentioned earlier, Robyn, teams met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and the next month.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is an appropriate response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the activities of the organization in mind.
We really want to get rid of our pressures and support our mission for the long run.
If you need to reduce a job schedule, it's okay.
Historial for all staffs, contractors, and contract workers:
The hope of our daily work is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until more notifications.
We don't set off day, if you can work much more on normal hours, this mission requires you.
Yet, the world cannot predict right now, and you don't know that you need to take care of the oldest person, go to a certain tree, or go to the doctor, your well-benes are our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
If you are sick, don't work.
This article should not have said this, but we did.
Cuti ill or PTO is not required, but tell your managers and help your team to examine calendar and schedule to ensure that the main work field can be solved.
Champions (if you are diagnosed with positive COVID-19, let's hope to let Bryans know in T congregation Ops so that T congregation can help with support and make sure that your situation gets the right attention of management).
Those who paid the hour's wages will be paid full.
We've said it again, and we're saying again, to honor our commitment to contractors and staff hours.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal hours of work.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to promote stress toward the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in these times.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager until we know what to accept and take appropriate action.
Some jobs are considered esensial.
There are a number of jobs that must keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, Trust & Security, and Dana Recognition team, among others, do important work that might require additional support.
We're gonna start a process with all the departments to examine the current goals and distract us from supporting things that are esenial for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most expensive project.
This will not be anything for the future.
We did not plan to "work the cower's work out of the way" after the pandemy went by.
You will not expect to work lembur to satisfy an unrealistic time.
In fact, we realize that new circumstances change and will be attempting to set targets and newlines if necessary.
What about the APP (Memorial Plants)?
In order to adjust with new reality and execution of the day - to - day work, we mean to adjust the time line for the 2020-2021 annual article.
our understanding of the meanings are to review the longest of articles 2019-2020 which allows more time to make estimates so that employees can organize important work, care, and care of the beloved men as well as to organize them that they need or want to work with a little schedule for the next few weeks.
During the time line extends are very short of the work and the pressures of planning today in all the organizations.
We will soon present our proposal to the hall of the next week and then update the embassy and the team on the next step after we received confirmation.
Thanks for the APP team for your leadership in this regard.

The SDM Operation Team is searching for the direction of the environmental ergonomis for supporting the expansion of the work that is distributed worldwide.
Tonight, we have requested all community visitors to cancel the public view of Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, to the Wademi has ended.
We told them that we understood our requests for renouncing and other boundaries can make them impossible to complete the activities set up and that no one would be given the penalty for delaying or modifying the target.
next week after this we're going to continue with additional guidance about Wikimania and other regional community community and themeition.
Generally, the centimens of the entire global community seem to be a sad result of this disorder, but at once relief for ignorance and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and the others.
To the front, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide room for community communities to monitor the effects and follow our communications with them.
Treat continued to connect during COVID-19’s situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We're going to use this time to share extra updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect to each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this e-mail and all the other COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure that all information is present in one place.
We also endeavored to keep regular communication with staffs living in countries that are currently affected by signifially.
COURAGE: If you have any questions about travel, events, primary work alurs, or difficulty about liputans, or other things that may require help, do not hesitate to give them know and work together with CRT.
Since we are here to help give support and become a suitable fugitive, we are here.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judahn, Director of International SDM Global Operation.
None of these changes are visible to our work and obligations.
In contrast, this change is a confession that, right now, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way we have never done before.
these changes are the steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can keep working, provide support that we need to move, and give the world the services they might have.
The work we discussed before will be there waiting for us when the time is coming.
For now, it is time for each other to support and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and may be a few months ahead.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work well when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Jaime W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The agiotensin composer b'Enme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme that corresponds to the outer surface of the cells (brans) in lungs, artifacts, heart, kidneys, and sous.
circumstantial ACE2 has a opposite activity with angiotensin enzyme (ACE), with reduce the amount of angiotensin-II and increase Angiotensin (1-7), so it makes it a target that promises to treat cardiovaskular disease. ACE2 also works as a point in entered into a cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 version of man is often mentioned as hACE2.
angiotensin angiosis angiotensin Enzya is metaloenzime containing a solid sleeves located on the surface of the endotel cell and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has domain M2 peptidase terminal-N and transporter an amino amino renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single membran protein of my type type type type, with active domains enzimly rayed on cell surfaces in the lungs and other networks.
Domain ACE2 separated from other transmetic domains, known as the sheddase, and the constant proteins produced into the flow of blood and finally applied to the rin.
ACE2 is in most of the organs: ACE2 corresponds to cell membrans mainly on the cell alveolars types II, enterprinium kitaus, artotel cells and vena, and the artifact cells in most of the organs.
Encourage mRNA ACE2 may also be found in serebral corteks, stiatum, hipotalamus, and brain batang.
ACE2 primary function is to be an ACEmbang.
ACE breaking angiotensit hormones saya menjadi angiotensin II cupkonstriksi.
Akhirnya, ACE2 memotong ameno amenstanin terminal carboksil from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Vyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and interviewed it to be angiotensin (1-7) cupdilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tal-Tle-H).
ACE2 can also break several other peptidas termasuk [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also organized transporting traffic asam amino netral SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembran proteins, ACE2 works as the main entrance point into the cell for some koronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that cause SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes CIV-19).
More specific than that, the S1 protein binding on scike or tonjolan SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 domain by the ACE2 enzimatical domain on the surface of the cell causes endostosis and transpose virus and enzyme to the endosom that lie in the cell.
The processes in this virus also requires priming protein S by the series of protease TMPRS2, which is currently being investigated as potential therapy.
Nevertheless, many professional society and regulasibilitas bodys recommend the continued inhibitor ACE and the ARB standard therapy.
A systematitude and metaanalisis, published on July 11, 2012, found that “the inhibitor ACE useres cause signifies 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control. ”
Moreover, "ACE inhibitor a user also reduces risk of pneumonia on patients that have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially for stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of the U.S. Inhibitor ACE is associated with the increase of humanity related to pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of the entire pneumonia risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy to be injured by the scar injury, and it seems that hemodinak paruts and oxygen efficient on the pig's son with an accountistern which is produced by lipoplisakarida.
The time of rhACE2 lungs on humans is about 10 hours with a series of 30 minutes instead of the effects (durasi) 24 hours.
Some interviews indicate that rhACE2 may have been a drug that promised patients with integration against the innovative system renibitiotension (inhibitor) classical or disease in the angiotension II in blood sire.
C'Application COVID-19 is an application designed to help trace contact to win the resembling of the coronavirus panrogasi 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("kontak") who may have been able to contact with the infected people.
banyak aplikasis are developed or updated, who have received official support of governments in several areas and yurisdictions.
Some frames of work to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
The problem of privasi was questioned, especially related to the system based on the track of the application's geographic location.
Unfurnitional Alternatives include Bluetooth signal use to record the approach of the user with another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would promote the functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In Tiongkok, Tiongkok government, together with Alipay, had spread applications that allow people to check if they had been contact with the COVID-19.
This application is used in more than 200 cities of Tiongkok. In Singapore, the application is used by TraceTogether.
This application was developed by local TI community, released himself as a source open and would be handed over to the government. The North Macedonias launched "StopKorona", a Bluetooth-based application to trace display against a potentially infected person and gave an immediate response to health treatment authority.
This application was developed by Communication and Technology and Health Ministrys.
Until April 14, 2020, the application was still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that contact tracking application is in an advanced development stage and will be available to spread a few weeks. The same application was planned in Irlandia and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and Selandia are considering an application based on the TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means instigating applications for CVID-19's CVID-19 who live in Moskow; this application is designed to ensure that they don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might have happened to the application’s violation system, that includes false positives and perhaps some effects if the data taken is limited to some of the population.
Among other concerns about the spread of the "coronavirus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets the limits on the type of organization that can add an application to App Store, which is limited to the organization of "resmi" or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon use similar boundaries.
The support of privasis to their concern regarding the application of massal surveys using koronavirus, especially about what infrastructurion instructors are made to handle koronavirus's environmental environmentes will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 organizations have made statements that call the limit to this kind of surveylan.
This organization specifies eight requirements for the government project:
surveys must be "sesuaied by the laws, needs, and proporsional"
The need for monitoring and polluting surveys must have a sunset klausa;
Data usage must be limited for COVD-19's purposes;
Security and animations of the data should be protected and proven to be protected by evidence;
digital surveys should avoid getting worse is discrimination and marginalization;
every part of the data with the third party must be defined in the law;
EVERY had to protect the abuse and the citizens’s rights to support abuse;
partisipation means all the "furnative interest" that includes the most relevant health experts and the termalogical groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) Germany and Reporters Tanpa Sempadans (Reporter ohne Grenz) (RSF) also released a check list.
The Google/Apple article suggested that it would be expected to cope with the trouble of the surveylans directly by removing the tracking mechanisms from the device operation system after they have no more needed.
Some countries use network-sized locations, and not applications, which removes the need to download applications and ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
network-sized solutions that have access to raw locations data have potential for significant privacy problems.
Nevertheless, not all the systems with the central servers need to access personal location data; some systems that protect privacy have been created and use a central server only for interaction (see section below).
In South Korea, appless systems are used to perform contact tracking.
As in exchange for using specific applications, the system collecting information from various sources, including celluler device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined this information to produce notifications through text messages to individuals who have infected potential.
In addition to using this information to warn the potential contact, government also makes information available for public use of the location, which is allowed with a vast change in information privacy law after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available for common use in a number of applications and sites on the Internet. countries such as Germany are considering to use the system of things and the system that protects privacy.
Until 6 April 2020, the details are not yet accepted.
The contact compatibility that protects privacy is a concept that has already been mapping, with a large number of research literatures starting from at least 7 April 2020, over the group’s common solutions are working in some private solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the approach of the user with other mobile.
Suggested, PEPP-PT is the efforts of coordination that contains a significant and urgentized approach, and not a single protocol. Protocol is identified involving the Serial Privacy of Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T/DP3T), Sementara Kontak number (TN, quoted Genesis Kontak, CEN), and Protocol Meteration for Privativeization (PT), and other Selac33338 (P) and N.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never left the device, and all match occurred on the device.
The Grup Privasi of the Lab Media MIT developed SafePaths, platforms to use the technique to protect privacy while collecting and using locations or databases to trace the penyebaran of CVID-19.
This is based on research from a "Apps Gone Rogue: Kekalkan Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020. Another similar stage of SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, company developed private technology and was also established in MIT Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe software technology to enable user to share a sensitive location and health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5 April 2020, the global TCN TCN Koalisi was founded by groups who owned the same approach and was a largely overlapping protocol, with a goal to reduce the impact and allow global interoperabilities for tracking and warning apps, which are the primary aspect of reaching a vast reception.
On April 9, 2020, Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by the official official application to be an open source.
On 10 April 20, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls the Android platform and iOS, announces initiative to contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on Bluetooth Low Energy and chronography technology.
They also published the core technologial specifications that are used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to launch in three stages:
tools launch to enable the government to make official tracking applications that protect privacy
Integrated integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to overcome the problem of data reconstruction and surveyings immediately distributed the system through operating system update, and then remove it in the same way after the threat passed.

Despite the efforts of the breath, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface rather than give in to a distance.
People too can be infected by touching touching the muscular surface and touched their eyes, noses, or mouths.
On the surface, this virus can last until 72 hours.

Some medical procedures, such as intubtion and resusuality of lung heart (RJP), can make cerets perapas turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
While there are anxiety that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be reduced, even the most difficult virus when people are crowded; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The Central Center of Disease and European Disease Control (ECC) says that although it is not yet as clear as easy as it is to spread, one common people is invested at two to three others.
Especially found that viruss can be detected for one day on karton/kardus, to three days on plastic (polipropilen) and rusteng baja (AISI 304), and four hours on copper 99%.
But this is basic, though, to the extent that natural balance depends on frequency and temperatures.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if used properly; soap produks illustrate virus pelindung lapisan, deactivate virus, and release them from other skins and surfaces.
Other Larouutans, such as tinzalkonium chlorida and klorhecdin glunnat (disinfectan surgeons), were malfunctional.
On the five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus artatic syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus of the new quantal disease, who was first transferred from three people with pneumonia related to the quantary disease case case in Wuhan.
All of the features of SARS-CoV-2 virus are new to the world’s impossibility koronavirus.
Out of the human body, these viruss were killed by the stairwell soap, which corrupted its protective bracelet.
Paru is the most blessed organ by the COVID-19 because the virus accesss inang through angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most abundant organs in the alveolar type II.
This virus uses a special surface glikoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter inang cells.
Cedera int’s heart cedera found at 12% people infected in the roof of Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often on severe disease.
High kardiovaskular symptoms are due to the response to systemic inflamation and imunetic system disorders during the development of disease, but the quant damage of the accept may also be associated with the ACE2 reseps2 in the heart.
The ACE2 Receptor is predicted very high in the heart and involved in heart function.
The Trombosis (31%) and vena trombobolism (25%) patients of COVID-19 infections in ICU and may be associated with a bad prognosis. Otopsi on the dead of COUD-19 found the alveolar damage of alveolar (DAD) and infilterymrat inflamated in the genes.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicalme for the breath channel epitel cell expressing ACE2, heavy COVD-19 patients have systemic hiperinflamation symptoms.
Specially, T cell that violates the GM-CSF patogenics proved to be applacating with monosit recruiting IL-6 inflation and lung patology on the CVID-19 patient.
limfositik Infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
Testing standard Metode standard method is the reaction of polimerase transkripsi rekripsi real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done to a sample of theapas found through nasof filter smoke; but, samples of nasal or sputum can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in just a few hours and two days.
The blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken by two weeks so that the result has a small amount of time.
The Tiongkok Ilmuwan mampu coolating this coronavirus galur and reorganizing the genetics so that the laboratorium throughout the world can mengembangkan polimerase chain reactions (PCR) personally independence to detect infections by this virus.
PAGE 4 April 2020, test antibodi (who can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) is in development, but is not yet used very much.
Tiongkok experiences with the testing show that he is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
As the many waters of the ground-glass multilobar opasity as well as perifer distribution, rosemetris, and postteriors are found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural Domination, paving gila (leobular alveolar competitors with a vocabulary condition), and consoleidation can arise during the development of disease.
sedikit data kecil available about microskopic lesi and CVID-19 patofisiologies.
The main patologi Temu on otopsi is:
Makroscopei: pleurisi, perikarditis, paru console, and pulmoner edema
Four types of pneumonia virus pneumonias can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmoner edema, pneumosit hiperia, large atipis pneumosit, inflamite interstisional infiltracy with limfositik infiltration, and instrumentive giant cells constraints
Pneumonia heavy: an alveolar damage infus (DAD) with an exudat alveolar infus.
DAD is the cause of the accountt breath syndrome and the heavy hipoksemia.
pneumonia in the stage of healing: eksudat in alveolar and fibrosis pulmoner
Blood: intravaskular inseminata (DDC); reaksi leukoeristroblasik
Presumptuous steps to reduce possible infections include living at home, avoiding places, often washed hands with soaps and water for 20 seconds, practice good exercise higiene, and avoid touching eye, noses, or mouths with unsanced hands.
CDC recommends that to shut up your mouth and nose with garpus when coughs or sneaks and recommends the use of the rest in my pocket if tisu is not available.
The right hand Higienes are when the rocky or the sprayed.
CDC recommends the use of the cover of the cover of the region in general, partly to limit the disabling by people without symptoms. social barriers are intended to reduce contact with many people, with the way to close the school and the work, limit the trip, and cancel a largekalaal meeting in public.
At least 6 feet or 1,8 meters.
Since the diantitiasi vaccine has not yet been until awal 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of epidemi, which is known as "miva".
CDC also recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after respiring noses, rocks, or slings.
Yet, only when soap and water are no longer available. In region where commercial hands are available, individuals provide two formulas for local production.
In this formula, antimikroba activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
The memboxide Hidrogen is used to help eliminate bacteria spora in alcohol; this substance is not active for hand anticipation.
Glatiserol is added to the humtibility.
People are handled by supportive treatment, which can include cairan therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
CDC recommends people who think they are carrying a virus to use a simple face mask.
Extrakorporeum membran Oksigen (ECMO) has been used to cope with pertapas failures, but benefits are still considered.
Self - cleanness and lifestyle and health patterns are recommended to improve imunity.
Suportive nurses may be useful to those who have a light symptoms at the beginning of infection.
Intensive care experts and lungs in the United States have arranged for treatments from various institutions to become free resources, such as IBCC.
Until April 2020, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19.
Of gejalas, sebagian medical energy is more recommending the parasetamol (Hataminofen) than theprofen mother to use the first lini.
Preditional actions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus reularan, especially in medical treatments when doing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
On the basis of the health power that treats COVD-19, CDC recommends to place the person in the Nile-Udara Tularation Room, instead of using standard Prevention, contact prevention actions, and paralar plumsibility. CDC son of disciplining the direction to use the use of self - protection tools (APD) during the course of determination (APD).
The selection that was recommended is: APD's garment, respirators, face masker, eyes pelindung, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not a face mask) are better.
Respirator N95 approved for industrial order, but FDA has mandatory this mask to be used by the DES (EUA) Usage Authority (EUA).
Respirator N95 designed to protect from air leading particles such as dust, but the effect on certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use that are not mentioned in the label.
If the masker is not available, the CDC recommends to use face protection or, as the last effort, artificial masker.
Most of the COVID-19 cases do not get so heavy that it needs mekanis or alternative ventilation or an alternative, but most cases are heavy.
The type of surgical support for people who have failed to breathe with COVID-19 is active for those who are hospitaled, and there is evidence that intubtion can be avoided by high flowing or bias pressure.
Unknown if any of these two methods produce similar benefits for those who are critical.
Some doctors prefer to continue using an invasive mechanism ventilation, when available, because of this technique, the penyebaran of aerosol particle compared with aula nasal stream canal.
IN many developed countries don't have enough hospital beds per sufficientpita, which restricts the health system capacity to handle the loval of a suddenly high CVID-19 case so that it takes enough inap care.
A study at Tiongkok found that 5% in the intensive care unit, 2,3% requires mekanis ventilation support, and 1,4% mati.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of the CVD-19 COVD 19 treatments finally enter ICU.
COVID-19 and oxygen are becoming more complicated with the artifact artifact syndrome.
The Ventilators that are able to do pressure and high PEEP modes are required to minimize oxygen delivery and then minimize the risk of lung and pneumotoracts related to ventilators.
high PEP PEP may not be available on old ventilator.
The study of treatment potential begins on January 2020 and some medications are under test.
Recresivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although the new drug develops may take some time to 2021, some medications are being tested have been approved for other use or are already in further stage testing.
The Kastam can be tried on people with a severe disease.
The volunteers who are recommending that WHO is involved in testigentity and potential treatments. FDA has given Sementara to convalent plasma as a experimental treatment in the case of someone’s very or very quickly threatened.
The convalent Plasma has not yet taken into a clinical study to prove security and motives for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched a celluler application to deal with this disease.
Users requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'kontak near' using surveylan data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can examine the status of three other users.
If potentially detected, applications are not only recommending their own self-recognizing karantina but also inform local health services.
On March 2020, the Israel government allowed peace - loving human body to track someone who had expected his mobile phone data from the coronavirus.
The step is taken to work in the karantina and protects those who may have been contact with infected citizens.
Also, on March 2020, Ulsche Telekom distributed amplokasi data to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to examine and prevent virus penyebaran.
Russians use facial recognition technology to detect carantina imposing.
The Komisioner of Italian regional health, Giulio Gallera, said he was told that "40% of the people are still moving around."
German governments do hackathon weekend 48 hours with more than 110,000 participants.
The same is true of President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, who called global solutions to coronavirus preaching.
People may experience pressure caused by karantina, travel barriers, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
Tenavar quoted Rory O'Connor, who said, "Know the social amolation, loneliness, health emergencies, stress, and economic decayes are perfect storms that endanger people’s mental health and welfare."
This disease can continue with a little or no symptoms, which is similar to the physical drips of an allustling disease of the public, such as pileks.
light Kasus biasanya healed in two weeks, while those who suffer ill or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
pregnant women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infections heavy data from similar viruss, such as SARS and MERS, but data for CIVD-19 is still few.
The most severe person is involved in the most severe, the COVD-19 can quickly develop a quant breath syndrome that causes perapas failure, synecks, or failing organs.
The Komplications associated with COVID-19 include sepes, abnormal blood signifies, and damage to heart, kidneys, and hearts.
COVID-19 patients treatmentd inap, while artifactal functions are seen at 4% of this group.
Sekitar 20-30% people with the image of COVID-19 indicate that the increase of hearts (transminasi).
reporting the same report, median times between symptoms and death are ten days, with five days spent in the instrument.
However, patients who are transferred to ICU have median times seven days between the instrument and the death.
In a study that examines the early cases, median times start from the beginning until death are 14 days, with a full rent of six to 41 days.
In a study by National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have a number of deaths 2,8%, while women have a number of deaths 1,7%.
Investigations of postmortem parue samples indicate a alveolar damage to exudat fibromiksoid celluler in both lungs.
Perubahan of a virus satopatiks died on pneumosit.
Pulas artifact artifacts are like an intreen syndrome.
At 11,8% of death, it was reported by the Tiongkok National Commission, heart damage, with the increase of troponin or heart stop.
Menurut March data from the United States March, 89% people who are treated have the instrumental conditions of medical and economic resources that can also affect human races.
The majority of humanities from varying condition because of the difference of the region, but also because of the metodology.
Less than a simple case count can cause a death number too high.
Nevertheless, the fact that death is due to a case that past events can mean a mortal figure at this time counts too low.
Ascensioners have been possible 1,4 times more likely to face severe COVD-19 and nearly 2,4 times more likely to need intensive treatments or to die than that of non-mixers. There is a concern about this long-term disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Hospital Otority found the lower capacity of 20% to 30% on some who are recovering from illness, and lung scanning shows organ damage.
It can also lead to treatment-intensive syndrome after recovering.
Till March 2020, it was not known if infections had provided effective and long - term term for people who were cured from this disease.
Champions Imunity may be obtained, if you look at other koronavirus behavior, but have been reported there is a COVD-19 that followed by a positive coronavirus test of a few days later.
This case is believed in this case was a bad source infection, and it is not an repeat infection.
This virus is expected to come from an animal, through a spread infection.
Originally, however, from December 2019, the spread of infection was nearly admirable by the expression of man’s impossibility.
A study study of 41 cases confirmed by the first CVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, expressed the first issue of symptoms is a December 2019.
official publications from WHO reported the early symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurement is used to count mortality.
These numbers vary according to the area and limit of time, and are influenced by the number of testing, health care systems, plumbing options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, personality types, and health total.
At the end of 2019, SICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infection of laboratorium and U07.2 for the death of CIVD-19 by Clinciagnosis and epidemilogys for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Raios, died over the case in which a term was specified.
statistics according to Johns Hopkins University statistics, death rasios terhadap cases global are 6,9% (153.822/2.240.191) per 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include cases of fatality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the diagnose of a person who died of certain diseases, and infection fatality (IFR), which reflected the percent of the infected people (dignosis and diagnose) of certain disease.
This statistics are not bound by time and by following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected is antibodi, the antibodi can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epilepetic episode in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 people, 80 centimetres%) died.
On Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread among young ones, causes relativeity, and may not all the death of COVID-19 were recognized as the death of COVID-19.
Further, the German health system has not yet been controlled.
In the Dutch Netherlands, about 3% of a population may have antibodi, as it was reviewed from a blood donor.
69 people (0,004% population) meninggal because COVID-19.
His pandemi and the level of humanity differs to men and women.
Mortality is higher than a man in a study performed in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest Risiko for a man is at the age of 50, with a risk common among men and women just don't seem at 90.
In Tiongkok, death numbers for men as many as 2,8 percent and for women as many as 1,7 percent.
The reason for differences based on this type of sin is unknown, but the genetic and behavior may be a reason.
The imunological differences based on the types of passions, the daily smoking areas that are inferior to women, and the men who have a community conditions, such as hypotension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higherity on men.
Europe in Europe, 57% of the infected person was a man and 72% of the people who died because COVID-19 was a man.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data about the sort of passion for COVID-19.
The study shows that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Persentation of health - care personnel with higher women, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance to expose a virus.
World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
Pemimpin leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for the crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak is identified: 31 December 2019.
That name was chosen to avoid reference to certain geographic location (misalnya Tiongkok), species of animals, or groups, by way of consulting international naming for stigmatization. Virus that causes CVD-19 to be named by the name of the quanavirus of the account 2 (SARS-V-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVD-19" in public communication.
Neither the disease nor the virus is commonly referred to as "cononavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and this disease were commonly referred to as "cononavirus" and "cononavirus Wuhan".
On January 2020, WHO recommends 2019-nCoV and the accounting disease of the accountt 2019-nCov as a temporary name for the virus and a disease according to the 2015 guide that helps us not to use the name of the location in the name of the disease and the virus.
COVD-19 and SARS-CoV-2 official name was released on February 11, 2020.
Because kapasitas limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when a Italian hospital was in need of ventilators, and founder could not give him in a time - needed scale, a local company of disapproval and print 100 diups that are necessary in the last night.
early after COVID-19, Konspiration theory, incorrect information, and disinformed about origin, scales, plumbing, treatment, and other diseases, which spread quickly from theng.
The human race seems to be capable of spreading a virus into several other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus replikasi on pigs, bebeks, and chickens.
Since there are no cures or vaccines that are approved to cure this disease.
international study to vaccines and COVID-19 is being performed by government organizations, academy groups, and industri research.
On March, the World Health Organization premises the "SOLIDARITY Trial" treatments to study the effects of four very well - known medications that are already with the most promises.
Vaksin is not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
The previous study of SARS-CoV used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 used a recipetor ACE2 to enter a human cell.
There are three vital vaccine strategies intel.
First, researchers are intended to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, both active or dead viruss, is intended to quickly trigger human imuncibility against new CIVD-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is intended to create a vaccine that makes the system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike proteins that help virus to enzim ACE2.
Third strategy is a nucleat acid vaksin (e. g. DNA or RNA, new technique to make vaccine).
The experimental Vaksins made with these strategis must be tested to find security and security on March 16, 2020, test the first klinis of a vaccine starting with four volunteers in Arkansas.
The Vactionn contains a dangerous genetic code that is copied from a virus that causes disease. hanging-antibodi was recommended as potential challenge for SARS-COV-2 vaccine development, but the method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active klinis tests that are taking place in April 2020.
Seven test test educating treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studis against hydroxklokuin or chlorokuin.
The medicine given by the new destination forms most of the Tiongkok study, with nine test of the Fase III on the brakes of some countries with the release time at the end of April.
On April 2020, the review was distributed about the development of clinical development and CIVD-19 already exists. Some of the drugs are being distributed for CVID-19, which include ployssivir, chlorokusivir, and hidroxiolorklorkuin, lopinavir, lopinavir and lopinavir.
On March 2020, there was a temporary evidence for the resemblancy of thevire.
Clinist recognition was observed to patients that were treated with a redegativevir in emergency treatment.
Testing Klinis Fase III is being done in the United States, Tiongkok, and Italy.
Yet, there is a call for a review review of the research.
The Korean Health Authority and Tiongkok recommends the use of chlorokuin.
Lensa, Lensor Virology Wuhan, however, despite the recommendation of one gram, records that doses twice are very dangerous and can die.
Prime Minister Tiongkok of the 7thth century, FDA mengeluarkan emergency use for hydroxlokuin and chlorokuin over the doctor’s policy that treats the COVD-19.
Early data shows that laptopvirin High doses need to enslave SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for studi in vivos further after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration. The awareness indicates that the early priming of tonton proteins was shown by the protement protemental prostitution 2 (TMPS2) series (TMPRS2) is very important to enter SARS-V-2 through the interaction of ACE2.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroksilorokuin with or without azimmisin has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not operate in the SARS-CoV-2 vitro and has no role known in COVD-19.
The satokin storm combining can occur to COVID-19 stage heavy.
There are evidence that hydroksiklorkuin may have the antisticinual qualities of the Tocilizumab have been included in the treatments by the Tiongkok National Health Commission after a small research was completed.
This cure is on the test of two non-accetics in the national level of Italy after showing positive results of his illness.
Combined with a serum feritin blood test to identify the storm of hookin, this drug is meant to fight the satokin storm, which was expected to be the cause of death on some who were affected.
On 2017, antagonis prescription-6 prescription is approved by FDA based on retrospective cases study for the steroid refractin syndrome of steroid refrasteroid flues made available by different causes, which are CAR T cells therapy.
Until now, there are no evidence and controlling that the tocilizumab is a powerful treatment for CRS.
Bidding antibodi that was refined and preserved by the system of things that have been cured from CVID-19 to people who need it is being placed as the method of nonvaksin anti-sif implication.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconsclusive result.
Virus Netralisasi virus is a working mechanism expected for pasif antibodi therapy to present a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
however, other mekanisme, such as seluler satoriksistity that depends on antibodi and/or fagosis, as well.
Other antibodi therapy forms of antibodi, for example, uses other antibodi monoklonal antibodiproduksi, is being in the development.
Convalent serum production, which is a part of the liquid part of a patient’s blood that has been healed and has provided a specific antibodi on this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Conronavius disease, a number of associated syndrome
Linliang Linliang, a doctor in the Wuhan Center Hospital, who was then infected and died because of the COVD-19 after the disadvantages of a virus.
