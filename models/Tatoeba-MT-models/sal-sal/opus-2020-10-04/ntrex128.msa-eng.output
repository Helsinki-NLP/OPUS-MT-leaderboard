The Councilman (AM) Wales is worried 'like a doll'
There's a difference among some AM on their title suggestions to be changed to MWP (Anggota Parlimen Wales).
It appears to be the plan to change the trial's name to Parlimen Wales.
AM of all political spectrums worry it can invite the cemuhan.
An AM of Bahagiani Buruh said: “It was weighed down with ‘Twp’ and ‘ Pwp’. ’
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘gila' and ‘p’s sense of ‘ uncleanness. ’
AM of Plaid said, his whole party's not happy' and has suggested alternatives.
A Wales conservative says his party ‘ mind open' about change of name, but it says it's a short jump of MWP to Bo guess.
In this context, the letters “w' in Wales are called the same as the English term in Yorkshire of the ‘u.'
The council's commission, who is in charge of the law to introduce the change of the name, said, "The final decision of any business called the Council must be a matter for the members of the people."
The Wales 2017 Kingdom Act gave power to the Wales council to change his name.
In June, the commission was to inform the results of public negotiations about the means that received a wide support to call a party as Parlimen Wales.
In regard to the AM title, commissioners of the Parlimen Wales or WMP, but the MWP option accepts the most powerful support in public match.
AM appears to suggest an alternative option, but it's a problem to achieve a deal and can present the head of the Honored Officer, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the law regarding a change in a few weeks.
The law of further changing changes in other ways of the wedding works, including rules about losing the AM’s credentials and designing committee systems.
AM will get the last vote about what question to be mentioned when they discuss law.

"A lot of people are in a different way now," he said.
"Bar no longer became a living room in the neighborhood where people will go always."
To the church, he was worried about money from the sale of aset won't last long while the leader expected him, and later they would come back where they started.
The churchs, she says, can be replaced by the apartment and condominium buildings that are settled by people who don't want to help maintain the holy places that are still in this neighborhood.
"The spirit of the people who are going to buy the condominium in this building is white people," he said, "and therefore it will make these churches closed at all because it is not possible that most people go into this condominium will become members of the church."

Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been played in St Martin since the past few months has become racist to Aritectic and contractors, some people brought by church leaders, other by the Episcopeal bishops.
The Vestri room - the congregation administration body, which is composed of public leaders - wrote a bishop in July of the concrete "will try to break the cost" for the vestri room, even though the vestri space was not involved in arcitek and contractors brought in by the bishops.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency in the bishops.

More than 20 million people witnessed a shock testimoni in Thursday by the court candidate of Crett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of being in a sexual attack in 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television networks.
In the meantime, the political station continued, with publishers interrupting the normal program for Friday's last minute touch: the agreement designed by Arizona Sen, Jeff Flake for the FBI to run an investigation for a week about the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had her and tried to open his clothes at high school.
Kavanaugh, in his description, said 100 percent would not happen.
It might be over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watch it.
The company calculates the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not available immediately for another network showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measure of people watching in the office.
To put in perspective, that's the size of the audience as well as the football game or the Aademy Anugerah.

He stood up with an influential eye for a few minutes when he was on his knees, shown directly in CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he said the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have the power when many women are in power."
Flake said that her office has come true and says, “Before the elevator is closed, she will say many words to the committee hearing.
The network of wires and broadcasts all cover the clock directly later, when the Justice Committee chose to advance the Kavanaugh ceremonials to the Senat to vote.
But Flake said he would just do that with the understanding that the FBI would see the charges against the next week, a political democrat.
Flake believes a part of conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen.
After Coons' conversation and some senators after that, Flake made a decision.
This Flake's choice has the power, because it's clearly the Republican will have no vote to break down Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.

Londonderry: The man was arrested after the house was released with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car threw a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage due to the door and the building itself.
A cross station may also have shots on the train at once.
The attack gave Livingston victory 1-0 to the Rangers.
The first Gol Dolly brought to Livingston wins
The Livingston surprised the Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 matches as the Hebox club manager.
Dolly's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team stays without victory in Premiership this season and face with the head of Hearts, which they're going to track with eight eyes, next Sundays.
Before that, Rangers became a host of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston turned out a run without losing on this side until six games, with the head of Holt who still felt a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler months ago.
Livingston misses a chance against the enemy.
The Holt team should have been far ahead before saving the gol, with their involvement caused the Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his work over the gol, but Alan Lithgow can only give up his work after passing to the horn of Craig Halkett.
The host's excited to let Rangers play in front of them, realize that they can give a problem to the authorities with a set piece.
And that's the way the goal is important.
Rangers admitted the free football and Livingston opened the curtains, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set the touch and gol networks from the center of the box.
At that stage, Rangers have been mastered the property but had found the defense of the house that couldn't gol Liam Kelly was one of the big problems,
The pattern continues to half the second time, even though Alfredo Morelos forced to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the gol Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's out of one more Livingston match.
Crosses continued to go into the Livingston box and kept cleaning, while two penalty charges - after the challenge of Glenn Middleton's successors, and one for the long - round balls.
'Fenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's amazing and the results for Livingston.
To men, they're so brilliant, they're going beyond the reach of this trajektory.
Their style of games and staff has almost not changed since back to the top level, but the big credit had to go to Holt to complete his team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett is very brave, making an orderly defense, while saving Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall around the toes.
Rangers are less inspiration, though.
It's good like they're sometimes under Gerrard, they're falling away from that standard.
The last ball was a little low - only once they cut the host's house- and it was a call for Rangers to wake up, which found themselves in the middle table.

hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake in Malaya, tsunamis, with the tol number increased
At least 384 people were killed, many were hit by giant waves on the beach, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island in Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to the beach at the Palu city on Friday when the wave of six feet (18 m) crashing on land at dubbies, sweeping many deaths and destroying anything on their way.
Tsunami was followed by 7.5 7.5 7.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared last night, people were still doing activities on the beach and didn't run and eventually they became victims, "Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia BNPB's impairment synaples say in Jakarta.
"No, it didn't come by itself, he dragged a car, a log, a house, he attacked his smua on land, "The Nugroho says that the tsunami had crossed the sea by 800 kph (497 mph) speed before the punches on the edge.
Some climb a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, say it.
Some 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centers in Paluu.
The air scenes released by a disaster agency indicate a lot of buildings and stores destroyed, the bridges roll and collapses and a mosques are surrounded by water.
The end of the whole city on the beach on Saturday.
Some of the milkboats feel in a area that has 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s Technology and Research agent says in one fact that the power that was released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as much as the power of atom bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city that was located at the end of a long and narrow teluc end may have increased the size of the tsunami, which says the syndicate.
Nugroho described the destruction as ‘ wide ’ and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping and hotels have been destroyed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the building collapse and he said that 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho says that the victims of soul and destruction may be more terrible along the coastline that is 300 miles (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Donggala.
"Community is completely cut off without any information's from Donggala," said Nugroho.
"For less than 300,000 inhabitants live there," said the Red Palang team in one fact, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading toward the crash area.
"It's a tragedy but it could be worse again," said Red Palang.
The agent was horrified on Saturday because he didn't inform the tsunamis had struck Palu even though the officers said that the tsunami had occurred in the time of a warning.
In the catalogy video on social media, the sound of a man on a building screamed toward people on the street of the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, tsunami waves spread the beach and pull together the building and the car.
Reuters cannot confirm the authenticity of the video.
The oceans and tsunamis led to a major leak of power that decided communication around the Palu and it was difficult for the authorities to carry out the effort to search.
Soldiers sent relief by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but people in exile still need more food and other basic needs, says the authorities.
The airport has been reopened for help only and it will remain closed until October.
President Jokoowski was scheduled to visit the transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesia Tsunami to 800 people.
It's so bad.
When Staf World Vision of Donggala survived the city of Palu, they went through a scene of disaster.
"They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It was a terrible situation.
Even though help forces begin to provide relief in a biasy mood, some say that foreign workers have a deep sense of experience going to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s arrangements, funding, provide supplies and shipping from abroad may be run only if a natural disaster affected by natural disasters.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster on the level of the area," said Aulia Arriani, the Red Sea team of Palang Indonesia.
"When the government says "OK, this is a state disaster," then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status anymore."
When the second night reached Palu after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, friends and families who were still lost hope of those whom they loved became a miracle that came up and made them feel sad.
On Saturday, a kid was found in a culprit.
On Sunday, the rescue team saved a woman's victim, trapped under a stone collapse for two days with his mother's dead body next.
Gendon Subandono, an army officer of the Indonesiaighers has trained two men who lost the earthquake for the Asian Sukan who was finished at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel was his student, Mr. Mandagi said.

The United States should double an artificial intelligence fund
"The U.S. Americans should have doubled the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence because China has become more active in that field," says Kai-Fu Lee's designer who's been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That view is specified after the United States government has made announcements about artificial intelligence even the United States itself are completely undernourished official intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced the plan last year by targeting to be number 1 in an artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
" doubled the search of artificial intelligence is a good start to view all other countries far behind the United States and we want to get the next success in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
"With the funds can increase a great chance of artificial intelligence (AI) next in the United States," Lee said in a bual meeting with CNBC this week.
The book Lee — ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order ’ is published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has passed away in one of the most popular company in China, Face++.

"Not China who took the academy leaders but the corporat company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that the basic immigration changes can also help the United States support the effort of his artificial intelligence.
"I think a green card should be offered automatically to the FD graduate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese National Council released the Explosion of the Expercion of the Racial Generation in July 2017.
"The Sainssis So the Chinese state provides funds for people in academy institutions, and it summarizes the way of the Sains State and other government organization divides funds to the U.S. researchers but the quality of the academic work in China is low," says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department established the World Health Center with a goal of collecting partners from industries and academy.
In this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is investing over 100 million each year in the AI investigation.

The people of Macedonia took a vote on the day of ahad to determine the change of name to the North ‘Republik Macedonia’; a action that would soon solve a dispute with Greece which prevented Macedonia from becoming part of the European Union and the Northern Atlantic Testament (NATO).
Greece, whose own territory called Macedonia, confirming that the name ‘Macedonia' represents the charges over his territory and has been invested to resist Macedoniant in NATO and EU.
The two kingdoms have received a deal about the change of name in June but the nationalists said that the change was lowering the identity of Macedonian's major ethnicity was Slavik.
The President Gjorge Ivanov said that he wouldn't be holding in the voice and monitoring, causing any doubt that the voice's going to reach the minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed to make it valid.
The question above the vote paper is written: "Do you agree to become NATO and EU with a approval with Greece?"
The change of name includes the prime minister of Zomran Zaev said, "The new name is worth joining EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that appears after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so they could live free under the European Union because it means our lives more secure," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopjee.
Although it's not valid on the sides of the law, the members of the parlien say that they'll obey the vote decisions to make it muk first.
The change of the name requires two per three majors in the parliament.
The commission of the country's election says there's no report about things that don't follow according to the rule happened over 1 p.m.
However, the presence of the election is 16 percent of 34 percent in a parlimen election in 2016 after 66 percent of the dispersion registered papers.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a diary in the capital of Skopjee.
PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko threw a vote paper in Macedonia for a change of country's name that would open to Macedonia to NATO and EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, built up a small stage and put the chairs before the tent founded by those people who were referringendum.
"We want to join NATO and EU but we want to join it with pride and not this way," said Kavadarkov.
"We are people of poor country but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn into China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Goa integration."
The prime minister Zaev said the attack in NATO would give a huge investment to Macedonia where his unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I believe the major will receive because more than 80 percent of our population chose EU and NATO," said Zaev after throwing the vote.
He said the 'ya' decision is ‘ holding back our future.'
A vote has been published on Monday ago by Macedonia's Institute for police research that says between 30 and 43 percent of the dial will take part in the sound abjection - under the required amount.
Another vote, running by Macedonia Telma TV, found as many as 57 percent of respondent plans to vote on Sundays.
From them, as many as 70 percent say they're going to vote.
To one of those voices were successful, the number of votes came to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the voice will be considered as the first serious slap to the pro-Barat government police since taking over in May last year.

Trump Assembly in West Virginia
The president does not simply refer to a situation around the High Court selecting Bret Kavanaugh as to the importance of the number of Republicans coming on the mid-Derays option.
"All that we have done will be held in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important choice in our lives.
I'm not competing but I'm very competent and that's why I'm in all the places to fight for a great candidate," he said.
Trump is connected, "You see this terrible democrat radicrat group, you see it's happening now.
And they mean to take the power by using whatever it takes, even if you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to break for power and control, and what they want to have power and control, we will not give it to them."
Democratic, he said, is in a mission to ‘lak and stop.'
"And you saw it for four days ago," he said, "to call Democrats ‘ evil, bad and bad."
He refers to Senator’s Justice Committee Senator Democrat Dianne Feinstein by name, who received a strong Boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you waste the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I wait one--it's a very terrible body language that I've ever seen"
It's no longer a vast church.
It is not wise for anyone to express their view.
When the Momentum activist in my local party votes to identify me, it doesn't surprise me.
After all, I'm the new one in the AP Buruh line told that we're not welcome - all because we're talking about our view.
My parlimen partner Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-depression.
In my case, the threat movement had criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the role of economic police, about national security, about Europe, the ironic issue is almost the same as what Jeremy did not agree with the former leader.
The notice of the meeting for Buruh Nottingham East party on Friday says that "we want a meeting that includes all the productives."
For almost eight years I was a local AP Buruh, a GC meeting on Friday night completely included all that.
Very sad today, it's not the tone of many meetings and political promises ‘ better, softer's been forgotten for, if, he had, he had ever begun.
It's more obvious that the difference of view cannot be accepted in the Buruh party and every opinion will be judged whether it's accepted by party leadership.
It starts soon after Jeremy became a leader, as a former colleague, I thought to share the political view that was almost the same way to make the U round and take that position I wouldn't agree--that't agree on the national security or a single market of EU.
When I talk outside - and no matter what I'm saying - then it's gonna be followed by a threat of abuse on social media, it's not voted, killing political centers, asking me to get out of Buruh's party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I knew that I was more lucky than my colleagues because of commenting on me even more politically.
I was impressed by the professional attitude and the integrity of my fellow workers who had been sold to sexs and racistism every day but never gave up.
One of the aspects of the political frustration of this era is how the increase of torture has become used.
On last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that Buruh's party cultivated culture.
The truth is that we're no longer the church and with each weul ‘untrusted' or change on the selection rules, the party is getting narrower.
I received many counsels since two years ago urged me to stay silent, not too focused, and then I was going to be ‘ good. ’
But that was not why I went into politics.
Since I was a 32 - year - old Buruh as a student of school, raised by the Thatcher government registration that lets the entire class of my class break, I've tried to have a better public service for those who really need - whether as a local party or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham who might be confused about my position and the bankrupt part of the security now.
To those who support us on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it's going to suggest the contents of our house, business and public services, I don't understand how to waste my time and energy for my loyalty to the leader of Buruh's party.
But the only message I have is that not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my dedication, whether the Buruh or not: I'm proud of serving you and I promise that no choice or political approval doesn't stop me from acting in what I believe is for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Somer that cannot be equal to the top

Climo preceded Ayr with the penalty, before, at half time, he got an eye, and then the solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest time.
But Melrose began a second time and Patrick Anderson's trial, conversion by Baggot, lowering the gap to five points.
There was a long delay because of the serious injury Ruaridh Knott, which was brought out, and from the start of the first, Ayr continues to go forward again through Stafford McDowall's experiments, conversited by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then given yellow cards, and once again, Melrose repays additional players with no attempt to convert Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce pressure period.
The host came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given yellow cards for no Climo without a ball, out of the penalty line, MacPherson cecah in the back of Ayr.
Climo conversion, as he did, almost like he started again, after Kyle Rowe held David Armstrong's box and sent the far out of Gregor Henry for the fifth team's house.

'Autan is ours': Bolivia that's surrounded by land will hope that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The driver of the sea military headquarters in La Paz.
General building spread the sea blue flag.
The sea base of the Titicaca Lake to Amazon is inserted with moto: 'The Lautan is our real possession.
To get back is a responsibility."
During Bolivia’s surrounding landship, memory lost a beach to Chile in bleeding conflict in the 19th century is still clear — like one of the longings to cross the Pacific again.
It was possible the highest hope in this century, for Bolivia was still waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has momentum, spirit of unity and peace, and of course expect a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, diplomat Bolivia.
Many of Bolivia would view the decision ICJ in the big screens across the country, hoping that Hague tribunals would be favoured to that Bolivia’s claim - after centuries consulting Chile were obligated to give Bolivia a place to go to the sea.
Evo Morales, the original president of Bolivia who faced controves controves for the next year - too much interest in Monday decisions.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
But a part of analyst believed that the court would not make a decision based on Bolivia-- and if it happened a little bit would change.
The U.S. U. U.S. member of the Dutch is not powerful to explore the area to Chile, and has set that he won't decide for the possibility of discussion.
On the decision that ICJ will come out only after six months of argument heard that the case "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, international law experts Chile.
And it's not to slow the base of Bolivia, for the past four years, there's probably an obstacle.
"Thesu to walk into the sea has been taken by Bolivia's administration now," said Zárate.
Morales's resulate has lowered the mercy of Chile that was a little bit of it, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile at one time when it's going to keep talking, but it's going to be too hard to engage a discussion after this.
Both countries haven't changed the duta since 1962.
The former president of Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representatives of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that would make court decisions very quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia a great place to open a new era relationship with Chile and the chance to "emptyment during 139 years for good together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most famous president in Latin America - using maritim issues as political help.
"Bolivia never gave up his right to get his path straight to the Pacific Ocean," added her.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says the nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless he believes in the U.S.
The North Korea Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not do their nuclear warplants first if he didn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promises made in the top congregation in Singapore between the rival leaders.
He showed up because Mike Pompeo was looking to start a nuclear diplomacy that stopped over three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says he's ‘ just a dream' a constant and opposition to the A.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will cause North Korea to lose.
Washington's careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang used to make a major act of weapons.
Both Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump want the second top.
But there's a doubt that Pyong is more serious about launching a weapon that is seen as the only way to guarantee the safety of his country.
Pompeo's planning to visit Pyongyang next month for the preparation of the second Kim-Trump's top of Kim-Trump.

John Edward: The language skills are very important for global citizens
Scotland's private schools kept a record of performance for acadecity, and this has continued in 2018 with one more bright exam results set, which was introduced by individuals and collisionative success in sports, art, music and other community effort.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, this school was represented by the Swasta Scotland (SCIS), trying to give the best service to their students and parents.
Private school goals are to prepare their students to continue learning higher, their choice career, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector they can and perform early school curriculums, we see modern languages continue to be famous and the subject of the tymg option is required in school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language that is understood, it will go into his head.
If you talk to him in his mother's language, it will go into his heart."
This is a strong warning that we can't just rely on English if we want to build contact and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduate rate at private schools.
A number of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages get higher A grades.
This data, collected from 74 members of the SCIS School, shows 72 percent a student got a higher grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learn German, 69 percent of them learn French and 63 percent learning Spanish too.
It shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skills of children and young people will no doubt need it in the future
The language is now, as the subject of the selection, is in the same way as the subject of STEM (sains, technology, engineering and mathematical) in private school curriculums and elsewhere.
A study of cellics by the UK Work and Ministrys in 2014 found the reasons of the employer’s struggle to meet the void, 17 percent associated with lack of language skills.
Again and again, language skills are Yeths to prepare young ones for their future career.
With more opportunities for prospective work, this skill is very important in this global world.
In any case, if they learn the second language, they will have real advantage in the future by having a lifetime skills like this.
Interesting communication directly with a foreign country will put someone who owns a lot of languages in front of competition.
According to the vote YouGov, over 4,000 mature adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak in a foreign language enough for conversation, with French language being used by two percent, 15 percent.
This is the reason for investment in language lessons now is important for children today.
Having many languages, especially the country is building its economy, will complete children with a better chance of finding a purpose job.
DiScotland, every school will be different in the language they learn.
The school bebrapa will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the language that is particularly important when looking forward in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interested in, there's always a lot of languages that can be selected from in private schools, with the energy of the expert experts in that section.
Scotland's private schools are dedicated to provide a setting of study that will prepare children and provide them with the needed skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
There is no doubt at this time, in global business environment, the language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be developed in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered ‘ international communications.’
The private schools will continue to offer this choice, these kind of immeasurable and anticipation for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bellen le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Swasta Scotland School Council.

Trump Assembly Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a convention campaign rushing tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first Trump assembly of five scheduled weeks ahead, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of confirmation under arrest for him to fulfill the void in the federal Court, Trump targeted to gain support for the middle raya elections will come because the Republic is risked to lose Congress control when the vote is settled in Nov month.
What time is Trump's assembly at West Virginia tonight and how did you watch online?
Trump Assembly at Wheeling in West Virginia scheduled on 7 nights, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's assembly in West Virginia online through the stream directly on YouTube.
It's likely to handle this week's trial for the National Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which has become tense to the trial of sexual wrongdoing with a vote of Senat verification that was expected to be arrested for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main target of this convention is to help the Republic to get momentum in facing November's election.
So, the campaign of President Trump says five assemblies in the next week is "crushe volunteers and support because Republicans are trying to protect and develop the majorities they have in the Senat and the Council of Percials," according to Reuters.
"Contrate Congresss are very critical for his agenda so that the president will go as many as we may be in our country towards the busy campaign season," Trump campaigns who don't want to be named to tell Reuters.
On schedule in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening meeting can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull the cover of Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trump has visited West Virginia, the country where he held over 40 percent of his eyes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Republican National Department candidates, Patrick Morrisey, who's following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come to support him," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Piala Ryder 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight in order that hope still goes on to the fight on Sunday.
After three sides, the collateral match on Saturday afternoon is probably what Piala Ryder needs this time.
Momentum was a sports concept that was an creation but he was completely trusted by the player, and more in this game.
So, where's that momentum right now?
"They have six points and now it's four eyes, so we bring a little momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth when he walks at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four eyes ahead with twelve more eyes to reenter.
American player, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of advantage and sense, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together all day and each has three of them from four eyes.
Spieth puts a game in the beginning of the green area and became an example to another player.
A good friend sounds stronger when he keeps his marathon, did an important leret punch to dress four eyes when he and Thomas misses after two eyes.
The leret hit that gave them victory on the 15th hole welcome to the same cheerleader, who told you that he believed that the American forces were still fighting.
"You just have to try harder and worry about your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all there is for all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas since two days ago are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story in Piala Ryder is unconditionable.
A different pair of players in this European but close four eyes of four and it doesn't seem to make any mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do bogi on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bogi at Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their power was given and shown by supporters is proof that they were players to beat on Sundays, and there was no more popular player to limit the possibility of the European victory during the sun set at Le Golf National From Fleetwood or Molinari.
As soon as both of them are in a different hole.
However, the conversation about the victory of the European army is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it easier for Sergio Saul, hero four in the morning, when he was compiled with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes set up a Spanish player and the Sweden player.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to be watching closer because interactions between their mates, given counsel and not given and strategies that can change in their eyes.
Europe plays better as a team of so far and further in the last day, but this four session also shows the U.S. team of bravery that many parties, including the local fans.
The European army led 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder
Europe had a comfortable advantage on the last day of Piala Ryder after rising from the game four balls and four players with 10-6 eyes on the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari ahead with two victorys on Tiger Woods who are fighting to bring their victory in Le Golf National to four eyes.
The European forces led by Thomas Bjorn were trying to maintain the astronauts that had been captured in Hazeltine two years ago, mastering a misguided American team in a four - ball session, with a series of 3-1.
The U.S. teams give more competitions in four players, wins two fights, but can't hold the abyss.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points from 12 points in a Sunday fight to maintain the astrophic.
Fleetwood is the first new European player who wons four consecutive eyes during her and Molinari, who is called "Molliwood" after the end of the week of the second couple to win four eyes of their openings in the history of Piala Ryder.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they finally beat Woods and a new American player, Bryson Dechambeau in the game 55504.
Woods, who went through two hard fights on Saturday, puts down the respiratory but now has been lost in 19 of 29 game four balls and four players and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who didn't play a break during the morning session of four balls, returned to Henrik Stenson in the game four players to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2 centimetres1 - to the position one and three in the world.
Europe was not lucky on a quiet and relaxed day in the west of Paris.
Three-time championship championships, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were a ceiling wood for America with two eyes on Saturday.
They've got 26,0001 wins at Jon Maat and Ian Poulter from Spain in four balls fights and then again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the game 46,0003 in the four players that were killed on two opening holes.
Only two times in Piala Ryder's history a team left four points to the role, even as the champion of the Furyk just needs to be a series of astrofi.
After taking a second place for two days, the reaction attack on Sunday looks like it's outside their access.
North Koreas say they're going to disarm a weapon without faith
The North Korea Ministers told the United Nations on Saturday, the constant partition has led to their insecurity to the United States and it's not possible that his country would free nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the Great Assembly of the World's body, North Korea had taken the "a very important step" in the last year, like stopping nuclear test and missiles, closing nuclear test and promised not to extend nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, we don't see any responses that match the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our country's safety and in such circumstances, we can't be able to break our weapons first."
Although Ri's warning the North Korea about Washington's opposition against the end of the nukleur shortage where North Korea will be rewarded because he took a step in his way, the fact is important because he didn't reject the volunteers as Pyong who did in the past.
Ri refers to the fact that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump were released to the first court between the president of the United States and the North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to work for "the nuclear address of Korea" while Trump gave the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to finish the end of the 1950-53 War, but the United States says that Pyong who has to let go of his nuclear weapon first.
Washington also refused to follow the advice to limit international partitions on North Korea.
"Ustigations first" and enhances pressure level in partitions to reach their goals forcely, and even against "the final declaration of war," said Ri.
"Perseption that the partition could weaken us is their empty dream they didn't recognize us.
But the problem is a constant partition that has become worse at our belief."
Ri didn't mention the plan for the second top congregation between Kim and Trump who was introduced by the United States leader during the United Nations Department trial this week.
The minister called only three meetings between Kim and South Korea's chief Kim Jae-in in five months ago and added: "Even if the party in this end is South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear end of the Korean market will not be found."
However, the tone of Ri was different from the last year, when he told the United Nations Assembly that targeted a large land with North Korea rockets can't be avoided after "The Lord of Evil President" Trump named Kim as a rocket man in a mission of suicide.
This year in the United Nations Department, Trump, who was threatened to destroy the North Korea, commended Kim because his courage took a step to break the weapon, but said many work still need to be done and the partitions have to remain that North Korea end the nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, said "If he took two years, three or five months, it didn't matter."
China and Russia are reported that the UN Security Council should be rewarded to Pyong who's for the steps taken.
However, the A.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Security Council: "Privacy of Peace must continue hard and without failing until we feel fully the end of the nuclear end, the finality. "
Security Council has been circled to increase the partition over North Korea since 2006 in order to uncover nuclear missiles and Pyong which's balistics.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations Assembly and said after that he was going to visit Pyongyang again in the next month to prepare the second top congregation.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July says that progress had been reached, just for North Korea in a few hours after that had cursed him for making "truth like gangster."
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon in this month to expose missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took a "a fitting step."
He said Kim had told him that the same steps that Kim looked for was the security guarantee that Trump was promised in Singapore and headed toward a normal relationship with Washington.
The Harvard Students have taken a course to get enough rest
A new course at the Harvard University this year has given all her students more sleep in the effort to fight the learning culture that's becoming a whole night's café.
A teacher's energy found students at a university number one world often can't understand basics to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medical research at the Harvard School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women, provided a school that he believed to be the first one in the United States.
After giving a talk about little sleep during my study study study.
'In the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I being told about this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - and it surprises me," he said to The Telegraph.
This course was introduced to the sequence of time this year, explained to the students about the needs of good sleep habits to help the academy and sports performance, and to improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrist at the Harvard School and the director of the university's medical service director said, the university decided to introduce the course after finding his students were less asleep all week.
Kursus for an hour in which it involves some interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a boarding image where students click a cup of coffee, langs, coachs, and books to be told about caffeine effects and light and how sports performances are affected by sleep shortages, and the importance of sleep routine.
In other parts, participants are told how lack of long sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, strokes, depression and cancer.
campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know he won't change the behavior of a student immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know like you have the right to know the effects of health when you choose to smoke, plus Prof. Czeisler.
The proud culture in ‘ watches all night's life, said it, while adding that modern technology and pressure increased to students means a lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Assuming you have enough sleep quality, it's supposed to be a student's secret weapon to fight pressure, exhaustion and concern, he says - even to avoid rising weight, because the lack of sleep is putting brain into starve mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So a California student who learned to study chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to plan this course, after taking her first year at the age of his first year in Harvard.
He said that course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course across campus.
The next step, he was hoping, was asking for all the students of the pascasiswazah to complete the same study program before joining the kompetiative institution.
Prof Czeisler suggested that the student should consider the use of the alarm hour before and also after sleeping, and realize the danger of the " blue light" which was issued by the electronic screen and the vector lighting, which could damage your sirkadian rhythm from moving, cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol defeated Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another defeat at the enemy when Dolly networks tied Steven Gerrard's weak forces with 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Hebox team is still looking for the first victory in the battle since the 4-1 February of St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 fights to cause his team to miss eight eyes behind Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Smoking on the seventh minute before the first half of the time and the Rangers seem to have no idea to compare position.
With the Rangers now down to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third stairs and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And Rangers may have faced another problem after the line controller, Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after the object from the area of his army.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on his team that marath to half the end of the Betfred Piala after defeating Ayr.
And Holt kept Livi 11 who stole one eye from Hearts last week and he was sure to be happy with the way his team's playing that's worried about their opponent at all times.
Rangers may be controlling the game but Livingston's doing more trials on the goal.
They're supposed to catch the gol only after two minutes when the first touch takes room to Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor but the middle player is targeted.
The kicks are free from the back of the Jacobs Keaghan found the captain Craig Halkett but his defense friend Alan Lithgow can only send the ball behind the gol.
Rangers managed to take the master's back but he lives just on the last 30 minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was supposed to be given the penalty football on the fourth hour of the five when he and Steven Lawless went forward but Steven Thomson was letting the Colombian appeal.
Rangers only managed to give two trials in the first half of time but former gol Hebox, Liam Kelly easy to break Lasana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's weak football.
Although Livi's opening gol at the second minute,34 may be opposed to playing, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to face with Jacobs' plan.
Scott Arfield was just paused when Declan Gallagher threw a ball to Scott Robinson who was quietly sending to the end of the easy finish.
Gerrard made a trade during a break by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost affects as soon as the whistling player gives her ball to Morelos but Kelly is amazed out of his area to block.
But Livingston continues to embarrass the enemy to play the game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sends away for a long delivery.
The Holts were supposed to spread the gaps in the final rounds but McGregor survived well to deny Jacobs before the Lithgow horns were targeted from the gol angle.
The Rangers exchange player, Glenn Middleton begged one more penalty football when he was attached to Jacobs but once again Thomson doesn't care about it.

Geiger created one method to detect and measure radioactiviti, the discovery that finally brought to a device known as PengiraGeiger.
As the basic science ever since, Younter Geiger became a bone of pop culture, like in a film "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, started by scientists unknown by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's Peira Geiger, used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear this earline, you can actually hear the effects of atoms given by radioactivity in the mineral."
Yes, it sounds now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his birth was 63.

A new cancer Vaksin can teach the imun system for 'see' bad cells
A new cancer Vaksin can teach the imun system for 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaksin taught the imun system to identify evil cells as part of treatment
The method involved is extracting the imunciation cell from the patient, turning it into the lab.
It could've seen a protein that used to happen to a lot of cancer cells and then rejected.
Recogn trials show a decision that affects patients with various cancers.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, who taught imun systems to recognize evil cells, recovered from cancer ovarnya after over 18 months.
The method involves extraction of imunciation cells from patients, changes them in the lab so that they can see "see" proteins which are common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then resuming cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our exams show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "cause the growth of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and chlorektals, obviously Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to take the implication cells from the patient and their "jar" way to target cancer cells has managed to treat the type of leukemia.

But the actor, 31 years old, has membride stereotaip hero maco, by mentioning his character playing on the screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to respect.

What's been taught on television, and on the street, which makes boys think they need to be a man like this?

HIV/Aids: China reported the increase of 14% for new cases
China has announced the increase of 14% of the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are infected in this country, says health officials.
About 40,000 new cases reported on the second tribe of 2018 only.
Most new cases are infected through sex, marking changes from before.
Normally, HIV is spreading quickly through some parts of China due to a contaminated blood transfer.
However, the number of people with this means that they have been reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said to the court in the Yunnan region.
However, the year to the year, the number of HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
The HIV Service through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homoseksual is no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people is said to be more so.
Because of the country's concertive value, the study estimates that 70-90% men who commit sex with men will finally marry women.
Most of the illness is a result of sexual protection that is not enough for Christians to maintain good relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to the HIV drug as part of the effort to handle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied his staff to disarm the Senator GOP data, disarming ' dangerous liar' and 'theor of the conspiracy'
A.S. Maxine Waters's Department on Saturday reported an officer who had published three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia law wall.
The Democrats of Los Angeles insisted that the claim had been spread by the people of "Ip ultra" and the websites.
"Sentation, fraud and more terrible lies," said Waters in one fact on Twitter.
This spread information is reported including house address and phone number for the U. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
That information appeared online on Thursday, broadcasted by an unknown person in Georgetown Hill during a hearing of sexual accusation against the Supreme Court of Cret Kavanaugh.
The news leak happened after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP address that identified the source of mail associated with Waters' office and spread information on the Waters' staff, Hill said.
"It doesn't feel like this is a fake and one lie," Waters said again.
"My hand -- where the identity, personal information, and his safety have been compromised because of this false accusation - is not at all related to this information leak.
The accusation doesn't feel like this is completely fake and a lie."
The reality of Waters is quick to invite online criticism, including the former former white House secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"It's angry," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows him no property to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't fight.
They can't question the motives of the impulsion.
They must feel calm."
Fleischer said when compared the Waters and the Democrat reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of critics who looked too angry during Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a champing Republican candidate to defeat Waters in the middle-wide election, also expressing his opinion in Twitter.
"It's a big news that he's right," he's tricking.
In fact, Waters said his office had told me "powerful authorities" and the legal entity of the law about this false charge.
"We'll make sure the killer will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can destroy and harm to any and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a weak Rowan Rowan Atkinson
It's normal now to find a sign of Brexit in any new film with a British slanga and it seems to be used to re-exalied the francais of the English action-- which started in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the satira talking about how bad we're being a new export of the country?
In any case, Johnny English, who was interested in educating eyes and deception, had the opportunity to damage the situation to the second time — more than any of all the things that he was the world’s world’s world was designed to spread the message in English.
He's certainly a strange stupid secret agent to suggest a glamor has a picture of Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and auzik who contributes a note to Chariots of Fire at the Open of London’s Olympics.
He also inspired from a mysterious international traveler and an agent, Rowan Atkinson, who's ever appeared in the Barclaycard television advertisements that are now forgotten, leaving chaos after that.
There's one or two great time in JE's new film.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter and wearing a middle - mid - year - old war and chiel sticking on his helmet.
As far as Atkinson for the physical dimedi is being shown, but the jokes are very weak and weird, especially the films "serius" like 007 and Mission are impossible now to offer the company as their material.
It's like it's been described for children than adults, and for me the bad Johnny English mistake that was not socializing and focused on the Atkinson movies in the Bean's person.
The main Premis is Great Britain in serious trouble.
A siber's coiler had been in the British secret web network, exposed the identity of all British agents in the field and failed the agent - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for the arrogant minister and who's currently fighting with political and popular corruption: Emma Thompson gives the best to the range of Teresa May but nothing is good in the script for his character.
The adviser told him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is sick and now is working as a school teacher in some fancy places, but giving an unfinished lesson to be a secret agent: some good joke here, because English offers a spying science in a school of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency and re-sembling with his former assistant Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged with a submarine commander, a muscular character brought by Vicki Pepperdine who was a little bit of a loss.
So, the Batman and Robin, who are tapted in the Secret Service of the Majesty Duli, back to face the beauty of Opheelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is being affected by a million-powered techmen who claim that he can solve the British computer problem: Jason Volta is evil and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventure with a small task: disguised as a waiter, set fire and burned down French restaurants; reaching itself into Volta's fancy airships; and English is trying to find himself in Volta's home.
All the funny scenes are brought well for the last scene, but because they look friendly and low - down there's a little bit like a child television plan about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And just like other English movies of Johnny, I kept thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a really fit of his talent?
Most of the Buruh nafi planned for the Britishs work four days a week but paid for five days.
Chief Parti Buruh, Jeremy Corbyn considers a radicial plan that will be watching British citizens work four days in a week - but paid for five days.
The party was reported to want the boss-boss to channel an operation made through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them one extra vacation day.
He will witness the rest of the weekends for three days but still bring the same pay.
The source says that the idea is "connected" with a party economic agenda and plans to bring the country side to the workers.
Moves to work for four days a week, supported by the Soviet Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A right source of the Buruh party told The Sunday Times: 'The basejay was expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen all night but working for four days in a week is a conspiracy that fits the party approach to balance the economy and favor to the workers and the whole industrial strategy of the party.'
The Buruh party was not the first to support that idea, with Green Party promised work for four days in the city election campaign in 2017.
However, this inspiration is not supported by the entire Buruh Parti.
A party talker said, 'Minggu work for four days isn't a party base and it's not considered by party.'
Canselor Shadows, John McDonnell used Buruh's trial last week with advance visosis for a social revolution in economic.
Mr. McDonnell says he's determined to take the power from the head without the face's face and 'catut' in the utility firm.
The design of the shadow canselor also means, the stockholders in the water company may not be able to re-enact their entire share because the government of Buruh could make 'excesss' based on why they were considered guilty.
He also confirmed the plan to put a worker in a company director board and create the Incolusive Owner of Inklusif fund to pass 10 percent private firm equitions to workers, which would receive an annual division until $500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minit" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI charges on Judge Brett Kavanaugh have postponed his final vote to the Supreme Court at least for a week, and the question is whether the discovery of the beero can affect the Republican senators to give their support.
In the interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the reporter "60 Minit" Scott Pelley asked the Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy looks opener than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, that accusation appeared, and said, 'Do you do it?'
He was firm, determined, clear."
In any case, the vote is already set.
"I've already made a decision with Brett Kavanaugh and he'll take heavy charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett is extremely denied it," plus Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he named can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
Say no change."

But how far would the success of the Worldwide People with 12 more years of success to reach his goal?
Did the idea give a free concert is a sincere way to persuade people to demand something of action, or just another case "clicktivism" - making someone think they've done something by signing only one online mailbox or by sending one cytivism?
Since 2011, Global National says they have been coded by 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who are impeling movements with different goals.
They say this action has helped the world leaders to announce commitment and basics worth more than $37 billion that will bring a change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements of their actions, and at least ten billion of them were already gathered or already gathered.
The group also estimated the fund that this has been known has affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the vital comitens include the power of Pe food, a sharing between the refugees and the concreteings in the UKs to help the children cut their potential, promised to contribute to $35 million to help eliminate the unsequency of the negotiation after taking more than 4,700 acceleration from Gobal ishelanil.
"With the support of the UK government, the federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make social social behavior that is unbalanced in history," said the Duta power of the Ullman Ullman when a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving more than 5,000 calls for UK fixing the food for parents and children, the government has been enused to provide for a project, the Pe makanan power, which is now going to reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answering one of the Lazim's questions on his website to ask, "What makes you think we can end the firm poverty?"
Global Citizen has replied: "This is a hard path and will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and desperate.
But, just like a movement demanding public rights and an allartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we're going to grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is the same artist who used to perform in New York this year, which will be covered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as "sect" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - secretary In State
Washington could be "if it's necessary" to use his Navy to prevent Russia from selling his oil in the market, including the Middle East, says the secretary of the United States Ryan Zinke report of Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the Russian taxing in Syria - as known, involved them on invitation to the government of Syria to find a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in central Tmur is to control the oil supply as they've been doing in the east of Europe and in the south of Europe, "he said.
And according to the officer, there's a way to handle this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea route is open, and if necessary, to stop it to ensure their oil cannot be broken," he said.

He also compares Washington's actions to Russia and Iran, and he stresss that act just the same.
"Selection of economicals over Iran and Russia is more similar, affecting and replaceing oil," said he, while referring to Russia as no other choice and with his economics that are so depending on oil.
This fact was issued when the Trump administration in the mission to improve the fuel export so liquid to Europe much cheaper to users in Europe, replace Russia.
Because of that, the Trump officers, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump themselves trying to persuade the German countries to pull themselves out of the Nord Stream two pipes, which is following Trump, which would make Berlin to be divided by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the Nord Stream's pipe project of 2 worth $11 billion that would mark an existing pipe capacity available to 110 billion meters and it's just a economic project.
Kremlin struck Washington so strong that this project is because of economic and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I'm sure we can't get a power supply that can't be used to be a gun to press and users need free to choose." said the Russian energy Minister of Aleksandr Novak next meeting with the U.S. Secretary, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has invited the dissatisfied of the German country, which has confirmed his commitment to this project.
The main industrial organization in Germany, German Federal (BDI), has asked for the U.S. not to interfere in the basic power of EU and also to the deal between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there's a third country getting involved in our country's power supply." said Dieter Kempf head of the German Company (BDI) recently after a meeting between the German Canselor Angela Merkel and President of Russia, Vladmir Putin.

A U.S. D.A. defendant with ‘ propaganda’
A week after a formal newspaper published a newspaper four - page advertisements in U.S.A., designs goodness with commerce between the United States - China, U.S.A., claiming to China, using a newspaper to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned a newspaper on September 6, the Chinese Daily newspaper Des Moines Register - newspapers most sold in the Iowa state - after they accused the Chinese country try to interfere in the elections on November 6 November, an accusation denied China.
The Trump claim that Beijing tried to interfere in U.S. elections explains what was reported by the U.S. officers to the Reuters as a new one in campaign to press China.
Being a regular practice for foreign governments publishing commercials to promote trades, Beijing and Washington now in a commercial war that's getting worse by each one of them wearing the credits on their imports.
The early Chinese action in this trade war is to target exporting in the country like Iowa who supports the Republican Parti represented by Trump, says the Chinese countries and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, U.S. duta to China countries and former governor Iowa, the biggest farming exporter to China said that the Beijng step has been causing many workers, farmers and American business.
China, according to Branstad in one newspaper room in Des Moines Register on Sunday writing, "now more consecutive by broadcasting propo multiple advertisements in our own free newspaper."
"In publishing this propo multiple, the Chinese government received the freeness of America, a tradition that puts the freedom of speech and news freedom," wrote Branstad.
"Reversely, in the newspaper in Beijing, very less than once the sound of the diversion and you can't see the true people's view of the country's ecnomy that's harassing because their media is under control by the Chinese Community party," wrote her.
He also added "one of the main newspapers in China avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he didn't express the press which one.
Republicans Calling Women’s Intelligence Influential Services Because of the Kavanaugh Acts, Warning by Analyzing
Although many of the members of the Republicans support and sided to Brett Kavanaugh candidates who have dealt with sexual disorders, analysa warn them will invite the reactions especially from women, in the middle elections.
The high Emosi covers this story, and most Republicans say in their records will continue with votes.
These things can't be changed," said Grant Reeher, a political professor of science from the Research Center, theusa University in one article published on Saturday in the newspaper The Hill.
Reeher's not sure with Senator Jeff Flake's step to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to save angry refugees.
"The women won't forget what happened last night-- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the right counselor and the national talker for the progressive team on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the feeling indicators "November will come!" when they show feelings at the scene of the Senate building when the Republicans have ruled the Justice Committee choose to continue with the Kavanaugh competitor even though there's a testion from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The democracy and the motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg a political analystist was free to the news site.
"People say this is too high; right.
This is probably higher than a woman who's going to vote from the suburbs and young displacers, 18-29 years, they don't like the president and don't vote.
Before the Ford public testimonion that defines sexual attacks against her by the trial of the federal Court, the authorities thought that there would be a bankrupt when the Republicans continue with confirmation.
"It has been a very complicated thing for GOP," said Micheal Steela, former member of the Republican Committee, early last week, according to the NBC news.
"It's not just a vote of committees or the end of the votes or if Kavanaugh managed to be a federal judge, it's also about how the Republicans won this problem and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil Director Priorities USA a group who helped the Democrats to the news broadcast.
However, the Americans seem to be divided into two and don't know to trust who's in Ford's testimoni and Kavanaugh by over half of the favor to Ford.
YouGov's latest review shows 41 percent saying they'll believe or maybe believe in Ford's testimonion, while 35 percent say they believe or maybe believe Kavanaugh
Meanwhile, 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh might be lying in his testimoni, while only 30 percent speaking the same about Ford.
After being pressed by Flake, the FBI are now investigating the charges made by Ford and also at least one more of the other charges, reports Deborah Ramirez, press The Guardian.
Last week Ford made a confession in front of the Senat Justice Committee that Kavanaugh held him in a drunk state when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the associate of the federal Court also showed his dick in front of Ford when a party he was demanding at Yale University about 1980an.

Just imagine, you've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but being fired from watching the main show.
The list of San Jose that contains 13 fights, including six main fights that will be shown directly every night in the UK Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are ready to connect, the audience in the UKs were hanging on when the broadcast was turned to the plan of Peppa Pig.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch this fight.
One of the fans said converting to a child's cartoon's "one joke doesn't melt" through the feed.
"The government's training shows the broadcast at 6 a.m. it's not appropriate for the match. They're forced to report to children," said Dave Schwartz, the right president of the market and the Bellator communication when asked about the transmission.
"The Khinzir."
President Bellator Scott Coker said they're trying to schedule the broadcast so that the audience in UK can watch it.
"I think, when I'm talking about again, I think we can do something," said Coker.
‘ But six o’clock on Sundays can’t be enough for us to do anything until our Sunday, Monday.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcasts are changed, there's a lot of text text and it's not good to hear.
We're trying to handle this, we think this is a technical problem.
But no, it's more about the issue related to the government.
I promise this isn't gonna happen in the future.
We'll limit it to five matchs instead of six-- and we're trying to do something that can't be made for fans.
It's a poor situation."

He wanted to prove that he was a "thing" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.

Mickelson wasn't so willing to face Piala Ryder on Saturday.
The American player Phil Mickelson will create a new record on Sunday when he plays for 47 in the Piala Ryder game, but he needs to be willing to make up the game performance so that it won't end with the driver.
Mickelson who will play in this double event for the record 12 times, has been distributed by Captain Jim Furyk for the game "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
At the bottom of being focused like the U.S., the winner of five games spent the time as a cheerleader and training with hope to improve the quality of the game.
A person who can't hit a ball straight even when it's at the top of his game, this 48 years is not the right choice for golf Le Golf National, where it's a very hard distance for a shot that doesn't follow target.
And if this golf field is just embarrassing, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will connect to the British Open winner, Francesco Molinari who have joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all these four games this week.
If the American player, it's missing four eyes started with 12 games, starting so fiercely, then Mickelson's game is definitely very important.
Furyk is so sure with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and put his hands on my shoulder and says he'll be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's strong.
He's been famous and has contributed a lot of work to this team in the past, and this week.
I may not imagine he's gonna play in two games.
I imagine more than that, but that's how and how we think we should do.
He wants to be the same, like everyone.
Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record for the most occurrence in Piala Ryder on this Sunday.
This may be the last time he's going to join the Piala Ryder who never compares his personal records.
Mickelson won 18 times, loses 20 times and seven seriess, even though Furyk said he was bringing one spirit on his team.
"He's funny, like to talk about, kidding, wearing people and it's fun if he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all young players have fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
He was not just playing but was much more than that.
The Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn knew their position that was ahead will be gone slow.
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that a remote position could be lost in the last day Piala Ryder and embarrass the situation.
This Danish player first joined the 1997 game in Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros driving as captain and preceding the American team with 5 points but only to win with very thin eyes once at 141131-131132.
"You keep reminding yourself after the position that led ahead in Valderrama; we also got the position in Brookline but we lost and in Valderram we win, but win a tipis," said Bjorn after seeing the 29th class wins on Friday and last night to be in front of 10-6 eyes in Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting out tomorrow.
Come out and play hard and don't make a mistake.
It's not over until the eye hasn't been taken and printed on the empty board.
We have a goal to get this tropy, and we'll focus on this goal.
I told you, I'd focus on 12 players in our team, but we all have to realize who's our opponent-- they're the greatest player in the world.
So happy with the success of his men in the golf field that's so difficult, Bjorn adds: "I can't be able to crow.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow individual achievements need to be highlighted and that's something different to do.
It's a great thing to be out there with friends and when everything goes well but if you're alone, then your full capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity as a golf player will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he has to give him the best in him as well."
It's a matter of Bjorn's opinion, Jim Furyk's opponent will hope that the player will play well as the individual player instead of the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three eyes of four eyes.
Furyk himself had experience on the last day where the position was changed, when it was in the team that was winning at Brookline before the loses of the European forces do "Furinship in Medinah."
"I remember every broken word," he said when he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to start it quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the momentum begins, it's going to pressure to the midweek.
We're going to line our players up with one of the rules we think we're gonna be trying to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to fight back and stick with Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon usually, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first top of the European rank.
"I made this rule because I thought it would keep it and include all once," said Bjorn about the choice of individual players.
The German new war ship was delayed again
The German army should have received his latest frigat in 2014 to replace the War Warship of Dingin, but the ship won't be ready until the next year of the system and the growing cost, according to the local media report.
"Rhineland-Pfalz," the first ship under Baden-Wuerttemberg-class now has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Ze Zeit who was quoting the military talker.
This warboat was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately in this great project's fate.
Four war ships Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigated by the Navy in 2007 will replace the frigat Bremen-class.
It's understood, it's going to contain such features as high-powered cannons, various antipowers of airplanes and antiheads and some features of frequency like reduceings of recognition by radar, red lights and antical ability.
Other important features are a longer maintenance period - these latest frigats must be able to be able to sail until two years from the vent.
However, many obstacles mean this high - tech warship that is said to be able to highlight the power of Germany outside the country - will be outdated by the time this ship joins the Sea Force service, according to Die Zeit
The lucky F125 F125 was a title of the last year, when the German Army officers didn't want to bring the war ship back to the Blohm and Voss' building company in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy brought their ship back to its building after sending.
It's not much known why the ship was returned, but the German press called some damage of the "mobility and device" makes this warship useless if it was sent to the battle mission.
The damage on software needs to be taken heavy because the warship of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class will be handled by only 120 classes - half of what it takes to control the old Brement class frigat.
The team also is where this warship is too heavy and this will reduce the performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any increase in the future.
The warship "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000-tan believed twice as much as the warship in the same class used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to corruption on the device, the price of the entire project includes training for classical classes is also an issue.
The project is said to have http3.1bilion ($3.6bn) - increase in the price of its original price as much as 白2.2 billion Euros.
The problem that hit this recent frigat war shows how much of the German military force.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the defense committee in the Parlimens are having a problem with a lack of battleships that can move.
The officer also said that this issue was getting worse, because the old warship that had been stopped didn't have a substantial warship.
He complains not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-classs can join the Navy.
The National Trust brings the light's life.
The latest research that was being run in a estet on Scotland’s highland was intended to explain why the rose used the form of earth to hunt food.
It is hoped that this study will bring to the latest discoveries about unique mammals that are trying to fly this and can be a guide for the activities of the Recognition.
A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow a normal bat, and a soprano pipistrelles and chocolate bats long and Daubenton's bats in the Wester Ross Park.
Special silver tools will be placed in certain locations around the estate to track the rose activity all over the season.
The NHS workers and volunteers will also make a move-up using a simple sculpture device.
The commander analyzes the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of every kind of bat and the spesie and the rhythmous act.
A habitat map and reports will be produced to create a picture of the earth’s shapes on the behavior of the bat.
Rob Godr, a return counselor to NTS, hope that this research will show the most important habitat area to the bat and how it is used by each species of rose.
This information will help you to identify the benefit of habitat management such as making the best way to maintain the forest for the rest of the related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UKs have been down a lot since the past century.
Violence was threatened by building and construction work that interfered with the roses and lost habitats.
The wind tubs and lights are also risked to the bate of the same size of a fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials and pet cat attack.
Actually, the bat isn't blind.
Because of their hoards hunt in the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location tracking techniques using sound to identify insects and obstacles when in the flight.
The NTS who was responsible for taking care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant parks and 76,000 miles [7,000 km] across the country, so it's important to be.
They have ten trained experts that often run the survey, check out the speed and sometimes save the roses.
This organization has also established a first bat protection center in Scotland in Threave estet in Dumfries and Galloway, which is a place where eight out of ten of the ten char species in Scotland live.
David Thompson the estet manager said this estet is the most suitable place for the bat.
"In Thereave we have a very suitable place for the bat," he said.
"We have an old building, a lot of big trees and a proper habitat.
There's much more we don't know about the bats, so the work we run here and somewhere else will help us understand what Kewar needs to live and grow.
He emphasizes how important it is to run a check before starting the construction work in estate because there's a possibility that we could destroy the rose nest that would contain the roses where this could kill 400 femalewars and the daughter ofwars, and maybe destroy the entire population of the localwar.
Kelawar is protected and is a mistake to kill, persecute or interrupt or destroy the nested place.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer for Bat Conservation, encouraged many to be helpful.
He said, "There's a lot of things we need to learn about the roses and for many species we don't know how their population grows."

Brexit: UK ‘ will regret forever' for losing the carout
UK "will regret forever" if the status of the world's leader in the release of the Brexit, says the Greg Clark trade secretary.
He also added this a little bit of a UK Toyota said that if Britain left Europe without any solution, he would stop getting the car down at Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese driver says the impact of this would cause a shipment problem on the border if there was no solution for Brexit and this would cause a loss of employment.
Factory in Burnaston - which released the Toyota Auris and Avensis - installed nearly 10,000 units of the past year, 90% of it was exported to other European Union.
"In my sight if Britain comes out of Europe Union without any solution at the end of March, we'll stop the release of the car in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the director of Toyota's business in Burnaston.
Some other drivers in the UK including, Honda, BMW, and Braduar and Land Rover also say their anxiety if UK comes out of Europe's Union without solution about how trades would work.
For example, BMW said they'd close their Minin factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car beings is about the risk of supplying networks if they happen to Brexit without any solutions.
The release of the Toyota depends on the basic installation of supplies based on time without having to be kept by car to factorys every 37 minutes from all over UK and Europe Union for harvested cars.
If UK is out of Europe's Union without any solution on March 29th, it's probably going to happen to the border that industrial players considered to happen to prevention and lack of extra materials.
Toyota couldn't have been able to store a inventory supply over a day at Derbyshire factory, said that the company involved, then the release will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the future minister of Theresa May's Fancy of two things with the European Union "needd to do with the fetus to avoid any checks on the border."
"We need a solution, we want a solution that will allow not only the success for now but for us to say this opportunity," said she's on Radio 4's programme plan.
"Bukti is not only from Toyota but also this other exorcism show we have to continue this very successful provider network
Toyota couldn't say how long the release would have been stopped, but for a long time warning would increase the cost and lower the power of this factory and the next will result in losing the job.
Peter Tsouvallaris who had been working in Burnaston for 24 years and was a member of the union union union union union in this factory, said the members of the union have begun to worry: "Follow my experience, the missing job won't return.
A government talker said, "We've brought a right and strong plan for connections in the future between us and the European Union.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, said the White House.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump's team with Rod Rosenstein's elections may be "rejected to the next week" because the Bcaloning of the Brett Kavanaugh is a constant federal court candidate, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein's doing a special investigation of Robert Mueller connected with Russian hands in the elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia and the possibility of preventing justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the election or not and the next unemployed Mueller freedom to continue the investigation has become the warmest gossip in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times newspaper reported Rosenstein was planning to use a secret silveram tool to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility to replace the president by using a 25-permbag.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, behind the report that he said he would resign.
Instead of announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump that was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid his loyalty to the Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh, in front of the Senat's pandangan committee, both they gave a confession.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to do investigation for a week above the charges against Kavanaugh, this has put a full dedication in Senat.
The secretary of the Trump newspaper, Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox's news on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "When the time has not been set yet, maybe in this week, I think it might have been suspended for another week looking at some things that are happening in the federal court.
Let's see and I'll always give the latest information to the press.
Some of the news will issue it: Sanders have never held any white house newspaper since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
The Sanders said he didn't have a lot of newspapers not because he didn't like the TV servant who tried to find a "heart" but he said, "I didn't agree because they really wanted attention."
Then he said the contact between the press and Trump will increase.
"Presiden's been having a very much more question session than the president-presiden before him," he said without giving any evidence." "We've made a calculation."
The press will remain held, said Sanders, but if the press had a chance to ask each other directly to the president of the United States, it would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've been doing so much since the last week and this will replace the papers when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from a newspaper when going out of the White House or when taking part in an open question - and - answer session or when the media - media congregation is together with guests of honor.
The media congregation in general is very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made an appearance free and weird before the audience gathered.

A stranger buyer will be given a higher setem case when they buy the estate in UK
The alien buyers will be given a higher suit when they buy the estate in the UK and the more money will be used to help a gelandage under the latest plan of Tory.
This step will cause Corbyn's success to pull the young voter
It'll be charged on those who don't pay taxes in UK.
The material is expected to be able to quote so that 1,500120 million a year - to help the homeless
The buyer of foreign residents will be given a higher suit when they buy money in the UK money from this will be used to help the homeland, says Theresa May today.
This step seems to be as if Jeremy Corbyn's success to draw young people by promise to provide a housing that belongs to and make people who think of high as targets.
Recognize this widow will be held upon individuals and firms who don't pay taxes in UK, money from the result will help the government to deal with the problem of people who do not have a place of living.
In addition to this, it is an extra addition to a setem duti that has been included a higher duti that was introduced to two years ago on the second house and a house that was bought for rent which may have been held three percent.
It's expected to be able to connect to  100,000120 million a year through this step.
It's estimated 13 percent of the new estate in London is bought by those who are not UKs, causing the price of procrastination and embarrass those who want to buy their first house.
Most of the fancy area - especially in the capital - has become "sloc" because many owners are a foreigner who spend much time in a foreign country.
This new base was just announced a few weeks after Boris Johson demands that the duti setem is reduced to more young people to buy their first house.
He accuses a large construction company intentionally maintain a high estate by buying the land but not awakening it, and prompting Mrs. May to remove the quota to the house can belong to the "Commith" problem.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing planning suggestions, including renting controls and eliminates the "un innocent."
He also wanted more power given to the council to build a new home.
Ma'am May said, "Last I said I'm going to dedicate my term to the prime minister to restore the British dream - this life must be better for each generation to come.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work, and build life here.
However, it's not fair for people who don't live in UK, and the company that's in the country to buy a house instead of the British people who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream to have a home is very far away, and the fact to live in many places with shame is true.
Jack Ross: ‘ My main goal is to manage Scotland'
Boss Sunderland Jack Rosa said he was to be a Scotland manager one day.
The 42 - year - old Scotland was waiting for a challenge to resum the North-East club that was on the third floor in the League One, less than three eyes than the top position.
He moved to Stadium of Light in this summer after carrying St. Mirren back to Brazil last time.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and so far," said Ross to the Scotland Sportsun.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was something that always pulled me there.
The chance will only come, if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
The successor Ross as Sunderland manager including Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager Alloa Athetic says he doesn't feel like khuathir following a trace of the name that was so famous in the big clubs, because he hadn't rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me the purpose of success at this time is ‘ Can I bring this club back into the prime League?
Because of the structures and facilities in this club, it's supposed to be in the prime League," he said.
"It's not easy to reach, but I'm going to assume myself successful if I can return this club into the prime League."
Ross just three years in the field of management, after being a manager in Dumbarton and being one of the coachs in Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to the third stage after being sent down and changed the fate of St. Mirren from being sent to the champion in the next season.
And said Ross, he's very comfortable now than being a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's a choice," he remembered back, when handling Alloa.
"I know the manager's business is a match to me, rather than to play.
Maybe it sounds strange because I made it, could live happy and enjoy some interesting moment.
Play it's a little hard.
There's a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I still went through this kind of pressure, and I joined a job as a player but as my manager was more comfortable.
I've always wanted to take care of it and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something that I love all my life."

Peter Martin of CGA's banking firms who gather these numbers, said: "The hot heat of the World Piala campaign of England, which means the July month would follow the pattern of June, where the pub-pub up 2.8 percent, except the restaurants fell worse.
The drop of 1.8 percent of business at the restaurant in June was getting worse in July.
The public estimates that put the drink and bars are powerful than the down restaurants.
Pubs that tend to eat also suffer the worst fate of the heat, but it's not a restaurant handler.

Weather and social events or sports events are still the main factor in the market markets outside the house.
Not surprisingly the restaurant group kept stuck, sales down 4.8 percent if you're in this year's comparison would have been worse with the cost pressure again.

My mother's milk Fish that compares to cows with a conflicting opinion in online
A mother’s milkmaker company has a variety of ideas that conflicted online because their advertisements compares to the cows that are being baked for milk.
In order to launch what the mother milk is quiet and can be used first in the world's technology company Elvie released a single musical video to show the freedom that the mother can feel by using this new pam.
Four mother dances in a cow's barn full of straw to the song where the lyrics say: "Yes, I'm a milk of my own, but you can't see any tails" and "if you don't realize this is not the drop, this is my chest fruit."
The paper said: "Get out, pam out, I'm sucking the kids, go out, walk out, I'm wearing my chests."
However, this advertisements published on this firm Facebook page have led to online controversial controversity.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, this video has invited many reactions from the public, many that say it's a good picture of the landusu industry that's "sticking."
"A bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to be edited and to give birth to milk, but poor cows are cut off from the mother of cows in a few days they are born," said a writer.
Elvie milk pumps can be fully entered into the distribution coli secretly (Elvie/Mother)
He said, "A single trauma to the cows and the calf.
"But what does it say to use them to advertise milk for the mother who can keep their children?"
Another person added: "A commercial that doesn't have to go straight."
Other people defend the advertisements, with a woman claiming that she found the song "being heart."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still feed the body milk.
Calling makes me feel really like a cow.
It was a little crazy, but I thought it was as shown.
It's a genius product," a writing.
He said, "This is a funny advertisement which is directed to the mother who is en routed and felt like "sembling."
It's not a commercial that compliments or evaluates the industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women exposed that they all had been dancing with hidden pam in their underwear.
The deal behind this campaign is based on the count that most women do milk saying they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie is really quiet, no wires or tiubs and can be loaded secretly in milk, giving the women the freedom to move, holding their baby, and also out while it's cut off.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in Mother said: "Pam Elvie is a product that is so revolutionary, it should have received a brave launch and provocatif.
As to the woman who's attached to milk cows, we want to put the milkman and all the challenges related to him as the main focus, as it shows a way to comfort and contact with the freeness of new pam.
This isn't the first time Elvie was the headline.
During the London Fection Sunday, a mother of two children appeared on the platform for the sister Jakubowski, using the products.
A hundred Children’s Trace Movers With Senyap to K tent in Texas Border
The number of prisoners are increasing when the month border transfers are not much changed, because of the retech and the heavy base known by the Trump administration, making the child's Placement more difficult.
According to tradition, the guaranteer is an un documented immigrants, and they're afraid to undermine their position to stay in the country if they take a child.
Risiko rose in June, when the federal authorities announced that the progeny and other adults in the family need to hand their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the imigresen authorities.
In the last week, Matthew Albeence, the right Imigresen and the Instance of Kastam, gave a description in front of the Congress that the agency had been holding people who had asked to become a loan to children who were unwitting.
The agent confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Hampire 80 percent of the same individual whether the borrower or the numerator, is here illegally, and most of them are immigrants without permission.
That way, we'll keep hunting the individual," said Albeence.
For processing children faster, the authorities have known the new rules that they need some of them to attend the court in a month's custody, not after 60 days according to the standard, according to the protection workers.
Many would attend by means of a video - language call, from presence on secara peribadi, to appeal to their case for legal positions in the front of the imigresen judge.
Those who are considered unqualified for help will be distributed immediately.
The longer the children under the prisoner, they'll be more likely to be anxious or depressed, and this will bring to a stunt or attempt to escape, following the protection officer and following the report that the system was released in the past few months.
The Support says that the concerns are higher in the larger facility of Tornillo, where signs that children struggle with feelings may not be detected, because the size of the place.
They add that by moving children to the camp city without providing time for them to be prepared emotionally, or saying good-bye to fellows may cause more traumas they face.
The U.S. Army Syria, France and Turkey retreat immediately
Speaking of the United Nations Department, Minister of Foreign Walid al-Moualem, urged pelarian Syria to return, even though the war in the country has reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also held the position of the prime minister, said the foreign army in the land of Syria under the helah against violence "will be justified."
"They should stay back immediately and unconditionally," he told the trial.
Moualem insisted that "toot on violence has been over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and the millions have lost a place of living.
He said Damsyik will continue to keep this sacred war until we remove the area of Syria from both violent and foreign groups.
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially for training and advised Kurdish's army and Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France had over 1,000 troops on the earth, with the warlike forces in the war.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem said, the situation is appropriate for them to return, and he accuses "in the middle of the foreign country" that "creaming unreditional fear" which causes refugees not to return.
"We have called international community and humanity organization to help this return," he said.
"They're interpolating things that should be a matter of humanity."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be helped to reproduce the construction until political agreements were held between Assad and the bombers to end the war.
The U.S. D.A. said the deal between Russia and Turkey to provide a military free zone in a area under the Idlib rebel has created an opportunity to continue the political discussion.
The Russian-Turki-Turkis have moved a major attack by the Syrians supported by Russia in the region where three million inhabitants live.
Moualem Howevers, the deal has a real time limit and is expecting the action of the army will target the fenihad including the rebels of Nusra Front related to Al Qaeda, which "will be deleted."
The U.S. special delivery, Staffan de Mistura hope to provide the first meeting for a new committee, which contains the government and the impossitors to advertise the pasca-perities and open the way for the elections.
Moualem states the condition of the Syriac government in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited to "checking the current construction article," and warning the disorder.
Because Trump will Support the Second Outgoat
With that logic, Trump will win his return pills in 2020, but, as it was expected by the liberal observation, the charges and the scandal ended his president's schedule before his time.
In an unexpected situation as "F life's most dramatic for a president's courtship!"
For now, there's no sign of a watcher.
Since 2014, the prime time has increased twice to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has a average audience of 2.4 million, addition to 1.7 million, four years ago, following Nielsen, and the MSNBC broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" has preceded the cable recognition, so 3.5 million viewer on the night news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the colporteur drama ABC "Designated Survivor," the story of the secretary of the cabinet who became president after the attack destroyed Malvaceae.

He remembered a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote in Trump.
Why? he asked.

Outdated money into the middle-wide national election game
It's not surprising that a global selection to 17 Pennsylvania showed the flood of money, viewed the resuming of the congres showing two menstrument is now compiling for the same chair.
The country of Pittsburg subbandars redrawnating the Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his chair in the previous flower seasonal election.
The Lamb fights against the present appointment of the new 17thfus Republicans, who at this time representing the region of Pennyslvania, which is overridden with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former areas were digerrymanders across the Republicans.
In a new 17th championship has begun a high financial campaign between the main economic campaign of the Democratic Congress Committee and the National Constitution Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became the name that was familiar in Pennsylvania after a tipic victory in Mac's special election for Congress District to 18 Pennyslvania in thetonin city.

A.S. Counts to manage El Savador for supporting China, then back
The diplomat Republic Dominica and Panama have recognized Beijing, with a little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama so that the partner drove out of the Trump Organization’s management team.
The State Department decided to call back the American diplomatic chief of El Salvador, Dominica Republic and Panama because "the latest decision to not recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department talkert said in the early year.
But fine is due to the El Salvador, who received $140 million in the form of America’s help in 2017, including the narcotic control and economic support.
It's recommended, including a piece of money and execution support, it's going to have a negative effect on the Central American country with a higher unemployment rate and murder.
After the internal meeting was held, the North Americans and Central Americans won a high-level trial that focused on security and economic prosperity, for similar meetings in the last year that looked as a positive move in the way to the United States.
But in the middle of September, government officials decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively stopped any discretion to defy El Salvador.
President Mike Pence's team is now going to give a word in the trial, scheduled on the mid October, as a sign of the administration in the meeting, according to the diplomat word.
And the third three American intelligence returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominica Republic with no message or strong fines from Washington.
The White House pilot for Bolton refused to comment about the details described by the three American officers, including two diplomats who have agreed to discuss internal considerations with the condition of respect.
Their description is supported by an external analyzer who is close to the administration and also speak with the name condition.
History Research
The things that will happen next may be reported by Robert Mueller's special lawyer against the possibility of the possible threat of justice by Trump, which is now a strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation to investigate whether the Trump campaign has joined Russia in attack over our elections.
If the congres turned hands, the Trump will face the challenge on that side, as soon as he's willing to face the dispersion, and may finally the jury that contains his partner.
It's everything that, and I didn't say that the fall of Trump must have happened-- or people like him in Europe.
There's a choice that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this fight is.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to perform a test of power for Hitler, had the West to try not to follow Hitler and supported Czechoslovak in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed a chance to avoid the cruel murder that happened a few years next.
History travels round the point of such influentials, and decated democracy routes will speed or be postponed.
The Americans are facing some point of this influencing right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires the Ring Rosenstein State Helper, the man who controls the investigation of Mueller?
Rosenstein has had a problem since this newspaper reports that, in the past, she had decided to make the president’s recording and make a scenario that the president did not deserve it.
Rosenstein says the Times's description is not correct.
"How are we going to act if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or not fair - or if he is confirmed to the Court of Ags even if there is a real claim of sexual attack and a fraud?
And so again, are we going to vote for the impossibility of Congress that Trump will be held?
If we fail in that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regim who had conquered my embassy.
He survived, moved to the United States, 60 years later, sending me to light a Sabbath candle on the table that had a whirl.
That's my legacy, how do I not feel about our future?"

The cederaan at the knee prevents the middle of Graham Dorrans from making his Sulong appearance this season so that the series 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers used this decision as a rock for a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player says.
"We play in this game with the trust we'll get something and we've got one eye.
We may be able to win at the end of the fight, but the series may be more fair.
They may play better at the middle of the first, and we play better at the middle of the second and in the better.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We wish we had three eyes but that game was hard for them to make a good decision in a game before but, the audience supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
The last year was hard, between all that happened with my injury, and the engagement in the club but there was a fun factor about this place now.
Good squads and teams are fun; training is also good.
We wish we could make the best, leave the past and succeed."

Even though the audience’s review has real ideas in order to be preserved, some have even talked to their families about it.
Half of the induvidue in the entire state study is considering that they've been talking to their couple about the long-term maintenance cost.
Only 10 percent are talking to their children about it.
"They want family members to keep them but not take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, president of the United States insurance business team.
Here's the way to start.
Speaking with your spouse and children: You will not be able to provide a family for you if you do not first tell them.
Such decisions are designed to become more and more important to make sure that nothing takes place and care of your family.
Your financial counselor: Your counsel may also help you to obtain a way to pay the expenses.
And it's a long-term care that could include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a risk insurance policy, a hibrid cash value to help protect this budget or insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Configure your law document: Configure legal warfare at one time.
Sets the health - care representatives in the area so that you can appoint individuals whom you trust to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals will be unable to communicate.
Consider also the letter of the representatives for your finance.
You'll choose the person you believe to make decisions for you and make sure that your bill is paid if you don't try.
A small detail: Imagine the effect your parents had on medical emergencies and were on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicine and all that?
Explain this detail in writing plan so you're ready.

New York's public demands death sentences to Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City suspect of violence that killed eight people -- an extraordinary punishment that no longer run in the state called for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using Home Depot's renting trucks to attack on the bike path along the West Seahraya on the Lower Manhattan, to the footwalk and the bike rider on the Oct.
In order to execute the murder sentence, the defendant needs to prove that Saipov killed eight victims and "niat" got a serious body injury, according to the intent to suspension of murder, in the file in the South state, New York.
Both charges brought to death sentences, according to court management.
A few weeks after the attack, the great federal jury has claimed Saipov to 22-criminal charges including eight charges of murder because of illegal activity, which are always used by the elections in a designable crime case, and an accusation of violence and destroy the motor vehicle.
The attack requires "a long-ranged plan," according to the defendant, considering how Saipov acted as "durjana, cruel and insult."

Talking to the West Virginia, the president did not directly answer about the testimonies given in front of the Senat’s Justice Committee, instead of commenting that what happened at the Senat pointed out the "cocious and liar."

"When you look at the exposure and leaking and they say "oh, I don't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking?
Remember the answer... did you round the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."

Pyongyang doesn't give any public reviews.
Most of the North Korea substantials will be offered by South Korea.
Seoul said over 30,000 North Koreas have been extenuating the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which had a long border with North Korea and was easier to rentas with the Free Army Zon (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China considers an illegal immigrants instead of political refugees and often send them back forcely.

The negotian says he believed Kavanaugh's description confirms that he didn't deserve the position in the Court of Agong Court, because he showed that he was heavy against Democrat.
"I felt he had removed his own credentials and his actions against the Clinton and Democrats," he said.
The negotiations when asked whether he would try to claim Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrat gets a major at the Court.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't speak right to Congress and the FBI, he's not worthy of holding the job at the Court of Aggan, but only in the court he's now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in D.C. Court of Litar Rayuan
The negotiations added that as Democrat, he was worried about Kavanaugh's decision against the Mampus or Roe v. Wade, because he was blocked as a concertal court.
In the court of confirmation, Kavanaugh was avoiding answering whether he would change the decision of the Court of Aggong.
"It's not the time for a man who's irremosi, the weight to go to the court and expect us to say, 'a wonderful,'" vegetting Pelosi.
And the woman needs to show him.
It's a sound, a moon and a year-degree word, and he doesn't hold anger without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it's something amazing, you agree?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had created a technique, if she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking, "You might think I was sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
Then he goes.
And I feel that's a smart idea."
Tangisans are allowed to channel anger because of often misjudged.
One of the most unforgettable memories of the old work, in the office that the man was recommended, I found me crying at an uncoverable anger, I was drawn by an older woman in the neck-- a cold manager that I was horrified - drawn me into the stairs room.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know what you're mad at.
They think you're sad and will be happy to make you sad."

In 1987 when Hart was arrested with a difficult connection in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, was deeply disappointed, feeling no reason to keep him in the president’s campaign.
"It wasn't the decision that was planned carefully," said he laughed at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more competing candidates and they don't need one more candidates.
Some call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because of events that took place at the end of the campaign, the woman escaped the efforts to establish the tube, and she swore that she would never fight for $2 million.
It's a waste fight.

"Do they feel I got a block?"
When he spoke that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt grateful for those who supported him, disappointed by a system that was asking for contributions and using non-internation, and he was angry about sexism - and he felt a strong feeling.
"You'll think I'm having a broken soul," as soon as Schroeder about the way the media responds to him.
"You're going to think Kleenex is my corporat.
I remembered when I was thinking about that, what would put on my rock?
"She's crying?"
