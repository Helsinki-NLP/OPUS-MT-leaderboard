Tom's very different from his father.
Like Dad, like a child.
Some of my friends can speak English very well.
Tom pointed the floor.
It's been a very good person lately.
He's from France.
Tom knew he heard something.
It's worth more than gold.
I would be happy to help him.
Learning about the foreign culture is fun.
When did you start using the lens?
Tom won't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to call us.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too late that it can't be used to cut meat, eventually I'm using my pocket knife.
Over his eyes blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom is forgetting.
Where have you been?
Last-lintas light used to set traffic.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room has a little sunshine.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken the red light.
Take me some water.
I'm familiar with not to look at it.
It smells very bad.
Word is a sentence.
There is no god but Allah and His Messenger.
I just found out yesterday.
You can buy it in the bookstore.
Let's get to Intercity-Express's car.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My sister likes music.
It's so easy to get along with Tom.
Want to go home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come this afternoon.
"It's not for us to wait two hours." "It's a sign I'll keep it for the rest of my life."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ant.
You'll never find a way home, through the narrow rock.
Tom was really not at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy drives a car.
The birthday card is coming soon.
Please read it again.
How can you do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I'm leaving, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
It's already included the payment of professional service to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logograms, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help her.
Two things aren't related.
How can I not realize this?
What's this about?
I'm still home because it's raining down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there's no difference between the culture of both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight right.
Tell me why he's not present.
That could have affected their decision.
The rain last night was full.
Tom's starting to be jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
It's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary rejected an invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He sat around his granddaughter.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to drive on the left side of the street.
He's focused on those puzzles.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream for me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his contact.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's scared of flying with the plane.
I've been expecting that he's lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The selection of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furnitur.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of our laws all the alignments, but the rich people sometimes have more advantages.
He'll make it.
I like cats.
It's over at nine.
Tom's been disturbed mentally.
Could I be crazy?
We had a very difficult winter.
I have to ask you, right?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You should have told Tom not to do it.
My mother has no ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a woman that's easier than her.
He's a copy of his father.
He has a good word to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm a spirit.
He tried to kill himself but at last he failed.
Do you guys have a lighter?
I want you to rethink your decision.
If I'm reinkarnation, I'd like to be born back as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill has not yet come.
Laurie slugsing.
They suggest it to go alone.
Tom is a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They swim.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom lied to Mary.
Not less than 40 percent students go to college.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom made his voice so that no one could hear it.
Did you see something?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
He greeted him every morning, when he entered the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, better off the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about her son.
What opera is being shown in Lincoln Center right now?
I feel so hard.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered that at six thirty.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened that letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom's signaling Mary to follow her.
It's time.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knew him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
