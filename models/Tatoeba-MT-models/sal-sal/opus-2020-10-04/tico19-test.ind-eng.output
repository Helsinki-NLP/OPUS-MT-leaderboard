How long has these symptoms gone?
And all the hypothetics must be handled in this way especially in your age
And with the fever
And blood pressure and colesterol you also need to examine
And are you fevering now?
And do you feel this chest pine right now?
And are you also having trouble breathing?
And can you tell me the other symptoms you've experienced with this symptoms?
And how high is your fever?
And I'm also rocky
And I'm a little pile and a cough

And this is rhinitis alergi season
and tastes the chests.
And I think I'm also a little fever.
And I want you to explain your chest's place
And they're also fevers.
And with your diabetes history
And do you know, my chest feels like it's going to be broken?
And do you know, people always cough towards me
And you feel the hearty
And you say that there's pressure in your chest
Whoever in the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, high kolesterol, high blood pressure
Is there any symptoms or other problems you're watching with muscles?
Is anyone else sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel another symptoms?
Have you ever been so troubled?
Do you still feel the hearty?
Because it's the flu season.
But we can't even intersect the chests that come from the heart.
But the more important problem now is this chest's nyeri
And I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know a lot of miles towards me
But we have to deal with every chest well
but now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest nyeri
Does it feel like there's someone who burns your chest?
It still feels like a breath.
Are they complaining sick of the same symptoms?
Do you have a chronic problem like a high blood pressure or something?
Do you have a medical problem or another chronic disease like diabetes?
Do you feel so troubled with that chest?
Are you suffering high blood pressure?
Do you feel troubled together with that symptoms?
Do you know what the symptoms are?
Did you see the picture?
Take a lot of fluids today
But I have diabetes tests
But it has a kind of symptoms like me
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
If your fever continues
If your fever is a hundred or higher
If you think your symptoms or problems you need a better examination
I had a fever yesterday.
I'm a little fever too
I had a fever yesterday.
I feel like I stab here, in the chest
I'm also having trouble breathing.
I'll send a picture to you
I feel my chest today.
I just feel a little sick head and fever today
According to my opinion, it's flu.
According to my opinion, it's a little flu
Does it feel like someone's very heavy sitting in your chest?
All started from the headaches with fever at the same time
It hurts in the middle of my chest.
Pressures like chests
in my chest
in the middle of my chest
in the middle of the chest
I'm having a nyeri in my chest
I'm so worried about this chest
I want you to explain this chest nyeri
Like high blood pressure or diabetes
Like right in the middle of the chest
For the fever, you can drink sweet tachipirina
Mary, how many days have you been having this symptoms?
You're saying that you feel the hearty
Sometimes I feel the hearty
Well, if there's another symptoms with these symptoms, except the pain.
Or someone sit in your chest?
It's almost the same as the fever, the rocks, the headaches, and the muscles.
Right in the middle of my chest
Show it in this picture where you feel sick
Because you're fever
So, do you think some of these symptoms may be related to pregnancy?
So, your children have some same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest nyeri
The fever rises at night.
My fever has been on two days.
The fever began to rise last night.
This is the Porter doctor at the emergency space triase center
Can you tell me more about your chest nyeri?
I feel pain in the front of my body, here, in the chest
I feel a strong nyeri in my chest
When I feel that pain in my chest
What do you feel in your chest?
When does this chest get started?
Where do you feel the nyeri in the chest?
Where do you feel the chests?
You feel like crowded in your chest
Do you know I have diabetes and other diseases?
You say that you feel this chest nyeri
In fact, the quarantibility of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased quickly in Europe/Wilayah Ekonomi Europe and Central England, January 1, to March 15, 2020.
In fact, the quantities of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show similar trens in the European Union/Wilayah Ekonomi Ekonomyan and the United States confirm that, although its stages are different, the COVID-19 clauses develop very quickly in all nations.
According to Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparation for CVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31th, 2019, a pneumonia case claster with an unknown etiology reported in Wuhan, the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Tiongkok Disease Center and Prevention of the Tiongkok agents of the disease are the new coronavirus that now called the concrete syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, disease has been affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections called koronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to this point shows that some 80% of the CVID-19 suffers a light disease, which is a breath infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers heal.
In about 14% cases, COVID-19 developed a more serious disease and needed hospital care, while 6% other cases have a critical disease that require intensive treatment.
The patient’s conduct in the hospital was caused by CVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 U.C. C.I.E.D., the European Union/Wilayah Ekonomi and England (UK) and compared it to the incident in the Hubei Provinsi, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA and UK cases in Italy for 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Kasus in EU/EA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has a remote public ministry and dynamic pharmacy COVD-19 in the other parts of the world right now following the dynamic pandemis in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemi.
In Eurosurveillallance 2020 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with CVID-19 cases confirmed by the definition of the WHO case.
In EU/EEA, the first three cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on the people who returned from Wuhan, the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 case has been detected in all 30 countries of EU/EA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31th 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date including, 39.768 cases and 1.72777 are reported, with 17.750 cases and 1441 death from Italy alone.
Getting quantative numbers and quantitive cases COVD-19
In the Central Control and European Health Control, the number of COVD-19 cases have been given every country in all the worlds up to eight o'clock. It is only officially obtained from the official source of the state of Health, national health and regional health authorities, and individuals.
This data is used to judge the COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK, and compare it to the tropn in Italy.
As the COVID-19 case proxy is active, we count the 14th quantified quantity incident, so it's a natural COVID-19 travel, in every state of EU/EA and UK, in the period of January 1–15 March 2020.
We're also suggesting a quamulational number of cases that each country has been told to 15 March 2020 o'clock compared to a Italian case during January 31,–15Maret 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in EU/EA and UK
The 14 COVID 19th quantative incident in EU/EA and UK are following tropn in the Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Gambar 1).
For EU/EEA and UK worldwide, the CVID-19 quantional incident began to rise about 21 February, and it grew sharp about February 28, 2020.
This Tren is especially moved by a quick increase of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK indicate the increase of CVID-19's quantatives.
Picture 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA and UK countries compared to the number of quarantiatives in Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
The data's highlighted that, up to March 15 o'clock, 15 other EU/EA countries and UK have reported the total number of cases that are related to the total of Italian cases before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases have been given up quickly in EU/EA and UK.
The Tren that was observed in the CVID-19 quantity quantity quantified that the pandemis rose at the same rate in all nations.
It's missed the difference of the stages that have been experienced, the variation of society’s health responses, and the possibility of the difference between countries and protocol differences to choose patients to be tested for CVID-19, which includes milking test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian area explained the situation about 10% COVD-19 patients needed intensive treatment and media sources reported that the hospital and the medical care unit in this area had reached its maximum capacity.
At this time, COVID-19 case data at the hospital and/or the intensive treatment unit at EU/EA level is only available for each 6% and 1% cases (not shown).
However, the data must be gathered in a way that systematacts to complete the current surveylans data that focus on the number of cases reported and death numbers.
The study that was done in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the use of the intensive care sleep and the crazy treatment in Europe, beginning from 29,2 in Germany to 4,2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
It means that countries can have more resources or more than Italians (12,5 places of intensive treatment and gila treatment per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario corresponds to health treatment skills, with the initiality of CVID-19 case abduction for each state of EU/EA and UK related to the risk of >90% over the intensive care care care care caret, is available at the sixth final risk of ECVID-19.
Because this far-to-better case in a certain state of EU/EA and UK countries, and the hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of certain regional services, information about cases and the intensive care bed should be provided at the level of the District for Statistic 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and the current tren in other countries shows that COVID-19 has grown so fast in EU/EA and UK.
Therefore, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit should be preparing for the SARS-CoV-2 Community functionality of SARS-CoV-2 and warning the number of patients that need health care, especially intensive care, as happened intensive areas in Italy.
As shown in the quickest risk of ECCC recently, fast approach, proactive, and comprehensive is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a transfer from the approach to mi tigaibility approach, because the fast rate of cases, as it's not possible to give enough time to the results and the hospitals to understand, and the responses that are not applied before.
Those quick risks also merge public health measures to minimize the effects of the environmental effects.
A short window of opportunity when the country has a chance to improve the efforts of control in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If it fails, the EU/EA health system of EU/EA is likely to face a patient shift that needs intensive treatment in a few days or next week.
The plague of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19), which is caused by the quantal syndrome colonies 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so far has defeated more than 3,000 people and invested over 80.000 people in Tiongkok and other places in the world, which caused disaster for mankind.
Mirip with his homologist virus, SARS-CoV, which led SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from bat and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a level ofkeenity and a lowerity than SARS, but more contagious and more about aging than young people, and more to men than women.
As a response to the number of publications increased quickly about this new disease, this article is trying to provide the time - time review and commission about advanced research subjects.
We're going to talk about the basis of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and physics.
Although there are still many unanswerving questions, we hope this review helps our understanding and the development of this threat.
Semi season festival on January 25th, 2020 has been an unforgettable memory of all Tionghoa people who are ordered to stay at home for vacations and a few weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
This virus was a very homologist with coronavirus (CoV) that caused a heavy quantal syndrome in 2003; therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization (WHO) in February 11, 2020, and the disease that was called CoV Disease-19 (OVIS).
Epidemi was in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Until 2 March 2020, this virus has caused 800,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with more than 400,000 patients returned and 3.000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy of the crowd number 1" and potentially ruins more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020, which sets up a virus sequenation of some patients, more than 200 then it has been published about CvirVD-19, epideology, virmology, psychicology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review is trying to sum up the research in the new subject that develops this fast.
As possible, we're going to try to compare COVD-19 with SARS and another disease, which is the Middle East ceremonial syndrome in 2012.
We'll also discuss this far study about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered questions, but urgently.
According to tradition, CoV is considered non-letal patogen for humans, especially causing about 15% pilek 4.
However, in this century, we have found the CoV who was very passive for mankind twice, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each one caused a direct outbreak in Tiongkok in 2003 and Arab Arab in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with the terrible morbidity and human races.
That's why, COVD-19 at this point is the third CoV plague in human history recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, pneumonia claster was first known from Wuhan on December 31,19 to the National Health Committee of the Tiongkok Republic.
Seven days later, as CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan reported.
In the meantime, the epidemi spreads fast to town, provinces, and neighbors.
On January 20th, health treatment provider infections are reported, which indicate that human transmissions may occur.
On January 23, the district carantina was done in Wuhan and the entire public transportation stopped.
On January 24, the first clinic study of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients are directly consulted with the Wuhan Sea food market that are considered to be the early location of infections from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague as a global health emergency.
By the time the report was written, this disease had spread throughout Tiongkok and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).2).
Because the developing situation is so fast, the end and the plague is still to be set.
On February 11, 2020, multipusat studi in 8.866 patients, which include 4.021 CVID-19 confirmed patients, predicting the following episodes://mp.weixin.qq.com/UlBi-HX_rPEBAbdA.).
SARS-CoV-2 detected people at all ages, but especially at the age of 3065.
About half (47,7%) of the infected people over 50 years old, only a little bit under 20 years old, and only 14 infected under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 is more investigating men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widely distributed in the klaster, especially inside and about Hubei.
COVID-19 takes average 5.9) The day begins from awitant until diagnosis.
The average inkubation period is 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days.
The average time starts from awitant until death is 9,5 (4,8-13) day.
Base reproduction number (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 adapted 2,23-4,82.
The number of infected people were increasingly before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of masif transport before the Winter Semi Festival in Tiongkok.
The patient's Mortality with a given case of 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and the population is modified for all patients of 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
Three main risks for COVID-19 are kind of ammunition (pria), age (360 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large virus intersect with a single RNA camel.
CoV can be divided into four genuss, which is alpha, my name, gamma, and delta, with alpha-and I-CoV known to examine humans.
Gikoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) feeding with its cell recipe, angiotensin enzyme converter 2 (ACE 2) and atptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the intersects are membrane.
The RNA genome was released into the Sitoslasma; after replication the virus genome, RNA genomics with the cover glikoprotein and the nukleokapsid proteins form vesikels of vesikels, which then experienced fusion by membrane of plasma to release the virus.
The new SARS-CoV-2 genomic Sekuens reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of me-CoV with more genetic in common than 99,98% of the 10 samples executed; the samples are taken from the original site of the Waan Sea of Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmisi electron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles found in a very thin human breathal epitellium section.
ACE2 human found was a prescriptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 proteins are linked to the ACE2 humans are weaker than the SARS-CoV proteins, which fits the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a infection that does not reflect SARS-CoV-CoV infection on patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein which is defined with orf3b and proteins specified with an orf8 password.
The orf3b orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protogenisity may perform in the virus patogenisity and inhibisical expression IFNebil; yet, orf8 does not have a functiononal domain or motive known.
In February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete cryo-EM-EM ACE2 of humans on a resolution of 2,9 compressed in complex with amino B0AT1 acid transporter.
They found that complex, that had an open and closed conformation, made up the dimer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can tie two S proteins, which became evidence for CoV's introduction and infections.
B0AT1 can be a networked target in drug filters to press SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intersect
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from bats and each is transferred to humans through musangs and camels.
By the comparison of SARS-CoV-2-CoV-2 with another CoV, the bat is considered as the original inang of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two CoV similar-SARS of the bat-SARS called bat-SL-CoVX45 and bat-SL-CoVX21.
However, intersections that help the virus to block species to detect humans still unknown, and the transmisi route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. brought snakes as a virus driver from bat to humans that involved homologic recombination in S proteins.
According to a study, researcher in Hystri, Tiongkok, suggest that the circle, the ants’s long-doging mammals are often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potentially as the SARS-CoV-2 intercesor based on 99% homology on the CoV that was found in the tenwing and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the difference that is spread throughout the genom is still a big difference; therefore, the results are conklusive as the evidence of the concrete still unemployed (Gbr. 3).
The psychic nature of SARS-CoV-2 is not known yet.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours in a dry environment and to 5 days on 20 °C and 40%th.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar traits.
It is recommended that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet light and hot on 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, ethanol 75%, disinfectants contain klorin, asams, cloroforms, and other fat linkers, but not klorodin, effectively disables the virus.
In general, the population of mankind has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, no detailed study reported about imunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV research before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
Generally, after invating the inang, the virus is known by the imunted system by a pattern recognition prescriptor (PRR), which includes C-type reeptor-like C-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (R).
Through a different path, the virus is investigating the expression of inflation, the dendritical cell maturation, and synthesis of interferon type I (IFN) that affects the spread of the virus and accelerates the antigenesis of the virus by the macrofag.
However, protein N on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid imuncibility response.
Soon, adaptive responses joined in battle against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ cells and CD8+, play important role in this defense.
The T CD4+ cell is manipulating B cells to produce specific antibodies of the virus, and T CD8+ cell kills cells directly infected virus.
The T Helper cell produces proinflite satocins to help protect the cell.
However, CoV can obstruct T's cell function by producing apoptosis cell T.
The humorality, which includes collisions, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodi is also important in fighting virus infections.
For example, the antibodi that's isolated from a patient who's recovering MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an extreme immunity system reaction produces a large number of independent radicials, which can cause severe damage to other lungs, and, on the worst skenario, failing organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 Inflamed with awitant claster, more of the massage with a surrogate disease and pregnant women.
In general, the person that is exposed to a virus in a large number or that the imuncient function is disturbed has a chance of being infected higher than anyone else.
SARS-CoV-2 period Estimation is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on studis of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that the average inkubration period is 3 days and is starting from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, indicates that the 40th period of inkubation of 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adapt the time of karantina is effective in the most accurate period that prevents people who are infected, but without symptoms, emphasizing a virus to others.
As a general practitition, people who are exposed to viruss or infected are usually required to be developed for 14 days.
Should the karantina be longed for 24 days?
Demam often is a major COVID 19 and early, with or without other symptoms like a dry rock, breaths, muscles, limbung, headaches, throat disease, rinorea, rinorea, chest pain, diare, nausea, and puppling.
Some patients experience dispnea and/or hipoksemia a week after a disease scene.
In a heavy case, patient disease developments are quickly became a punctual disease syndrome, syok, metabolic sydosis, and coagulati.
The patients that have fever and/or the cement symptoms and the quant fever, though without any other lungs, must be filtered against the virus to dignosis.
The demography study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percent of the symptoms of 98% for fever, 76% for dry rocks, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for dire; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar interviews have been reported in two recent studies, which is the study of family klasters and clasters because of transmisis of the asimtomatic people.
Sebrun with that, demography study in 2012 indicated that MERS-CoV patients also suffered fever (98%), dry rocks (47%), and dispnea (55%) as his main symptoms.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and the throat pain (21%) also observed the MERS patient.
On SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry rock (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diare (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) shown as major symptoms and ventilation support required for about 14% patients.
Until February 14th, COVID-19's mortality of 2% with a confirmed case reached 66.576 throughout the world.
SARS's mortality in November 2002 is 10% of 8096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demography study in June 2012, the mortality of 37% of 2.494 cases confirmed.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6,47 at the interval of trust (CI) 95% of 5,71-7,23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only about 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Tabel 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread ability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not unfinished MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control SARS-CoV-2's environment is bigger than the MERS-CoV-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Awittan was often found in one family or from one group or vehicle like a cruise.
Pasien often has a trip history or lives in Wuhan or another area that is linked to a infected or patient in the last two weeks before awitant.
It is reported that people can carry a virus without showing more symptoms than two weeks and patients who are returned from the hospital to bring a virus again, and it is causing an interest to increase the time of karantina.
In the early stage, patients have a calculate of the white blood cell of the periphere (the limfosit) normal or down.
For example, limfopenia with a count of white blood cells <4×109/L, which includes limfosit < 1×109/L, and asparttrane amisphere and viremia that is raised to 1.099 CVID-19 patients.
The enzyme rates of heart and muscles and mioglobins are increasing in a number of patients, as well as protein C-reactive and blood rates increased in most patients.
On patients with heavy cases, the D-dimer rate is increased, which is the product of fibrins that are in blood, and the limfosit counts increase in progress.
The rest of the toraks were found in a large amount of CVID-19 patients and marked with a live shadow or a ground-glass opasity in the paru.
Pasien has often suffered atipical pneumonia, lung injury, and abject syndrome.
When ARDS happens, inflamation is unended, the liquid mechanism, and the progressive fibrosis is very inflaming gas exchange.
Enable pneumosition of type I and type II lowers the flow rate and increase the surface pressure so that lowers the lung ability to expand and increase the risk of lung slaps.
Therefore, the worst interview of the toraks is often parallel with the worst disease level.
In February 18, 2020, the first patological analysis shows pneumosit pneumosition table, hialin form, and limfositation of intersectation, and synthesitical synthematical synthematical in the death of this disease, according to the psychiatologies of the virus and DIDS and similar orgonology of SAR and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 Detect through transcryption polymerase response (RT-PCR) used as primary criteria for CIVD-19 diagnosis.
However, because of a negative level, which can speed up the epidemi, clinic manifestation began to be used for diagnosis ( that no longer depends on RT-PCR) in the 13th of 2020.
Same situation happens to the SARS diagnosis.
That's why, the combination of the disease history, the clinic manifestation, the lab test, and the radiologic interview is very important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang group explains the protocol of SERLOCK-CRISPR techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA SARS-CoV-2 sintetik on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copy of the input microliters) using cels in less than one inntation.
May it be, this new technique can very increase sensitivity and facility if it's defined on a chronic sample.
Because of experience with the new CoV, doctors are especially offering support treatments to COVD-19 patients, as long as they try to use or apply to other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other virus disease (Tabel 2).2).
Theseapis include therapies that are present and potential therapys with physics, imunosupres, steroids, plasma from patients that are already recovered, traditional Tionghoa, and psychologic support.
Even the plasma of a patient who has been encircled for use in therapy.
The farming company developed antibodi and vaccines against this virus.
At the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacked the paru and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidneys.
However, the functionality and execution failure is a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, the internsection support is very important to exaggerate the symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and ventilation of invasif, depending on the medical level of disease.
Pasien with heavy exercise symptoms should be supported by extrakorporeum membrane oxygen (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmoner technique used for heart failure treatment or ability that threatens the soul.
Besides, electrolit balance care, control and secondary infection treatment, and the protection of vital organ functions is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The extreme immunity system reactions are known to cause a lone storm to the SARS patient and MERS.
The satokin is the form of systemic inflic inflictries marked the excreation of the loss of a sitokin, which includes TNF using TL-1 berdoa, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN church, IFN church, IFN, IFN, and MCP-1.
This Sitkin-stokin has been programmed to release a large number of free radikals that become the primary cause of ARDS and failing organs.
Imunosupresi is very important in satokin storm arrests, especially on severe patients.
Kortikosteroid and Tocilizumab, a anti-IL6 anti-colonal anti-IL6 anti-colonal, has been used to handle the satokin storm.
Other imunosuprecies for a sitokin storm include an imuned response module that IFN-Bus, IL-1, and TNF; inhibidsion JAK; blinatumomab; the feeder sitokin 4; and inhibitor HDAC.
Steroid, as an imunosupresan, many are used in SARS treatments to reduce inflatitorial damage.
However, steroids on high dose are useless to hurt the weight of the SARS patient and COVID-19.
Instead, steroid can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which is very affected by prognosis.
Nevertheless, a brief cor Hayesteroid gift at the low dose to be encouraged to be given with careful attention to the COVID-19 patient.
At this review, there was no effectiverapist that had been confirmed.
However, an intravena’s gift, which is an nukleotida analog, found nutritious to a CVID-19 patient from the United States.
Redesivir is a new drug developed by Gilead, reexaminating for the treatment of the disease caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, the brakes ofvir also show inhibition to another single RNA virus, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
In this case, Gilead prepares this gift for Tiongkok to perform a trial attack on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the result is eager.
In addition, baricitinb, interferons, lopinavir/ritonavir, and laptopvirin has been recommended as potential therapy for patients with the accountimate symptoms.
Diare, nausea, muntah, heart damage, and other side reactions can happen after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with another cure that the patient has to be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients that have been healed and antibodi creation.
There's a long history of patient blood gatherings that have been healed from a disease to cure other patients who suffer the same disease or to prevent the sick.
True, patients who are already cured often have a relative antibodi rate in his blood.
Antibodi is an imunoglobulin produced lymphosit B to fight patogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules on patogens, and directs them.
According to this, the plasma is gathered from the blood of a bunch of patients that have been healed from CVID-19 and are injected to 10 sick patients.
They're better in 24 hours, along with it down inflammation and virus loads and increasing oxygen in blood.
However, the verification and clarification needs to be done to provide such methods for the use of large scales before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to the cemental effects, some of the shortages are related to the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodi can analyze an extreme response and cause a satokin release syndrome, which is a potentially potentially threatening soul.
The antibodi concentration is usually low and the plasma is needed in large amounts to care for critical patients.
The expansion and antibodi production are specific fast enough to fight global epidemi is hard to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practically disolating B cells from a patient that has been healed and identifying genetic codes that have effective antibodied or doing effective antibodi filters that are effective to the very important proteins.
This way, we can easily increase antibodi production scales.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
But most of it depends on the combinations of various components in formulas, this Formulas depend on the TCM disease diagnosis.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or not yet obvious because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Now, because of effective therapy and specific for COVID-19 not yet, TCM is one of the major alternative therapys for patients with light symptoms to be or for people who are recovering from heavy diseases.
For example, Sapsul Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen was found manjur for COVID-19 therapy.
The top stage of the COVD-19 patient therapy is observed in some Tiongkok provinces using TCM on 87% patients, which include Gansu (63,7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei Province, which uses TCM only about 30% CIVID-19 patients, has a low test.
Still, this comparison is still very harsh because there are many other factors of impact, such as the amount and the patient’s frequency, it must be included in evaluating.
In February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends are composing a study that compares the western drug therapy (WM) with the WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to restore the body temperature, lose the symptoms, and the instrument's very shortr on the WM+TCM group is compared to the WM.
The more impressive thing, the level of the symptoms (from light to weight) is lower for the WM+TCM group is compared to the WM group (7,4% than 46,2%) and the humanity is lower on the WM+TM group than the WMC is equal to only group of WM (8,8% instead of 39%).
Nevertheless, the TCM efficiency and security are still waiting for a better discussion test on a larger scale and at more research center.
The other interesting thing is to maintain the work mechanism and identify effective components in the TCM therapy or combinations, if possible.
Most patients expected or confirmed the CVID-19 feel very fear of a very contagious disease and even disarming this, and people who are disarmed, lonely, and anger.
Moreover, infection symptoms such as fever, hypothesia, and coughs and therapy side effects such as insomnia caused by cortimesteroid can cause greater anxiety and emotional pressure.
At the beginning of the SARS plague, a series of psychiatristian morbidity, which includes depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychology, psychotic symptoms, delirium symptoms, and even suditionalities have been reported.
Recognizing contact and carantina's history is mandatory, as part of the health response to COVID-19’s outbreak, can make people more anxious and more concerned about respiratory effects, carantina, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, expected people, and people who are consulted with them, and the general public.
The psychology support must include the form of multidisciplining mental health team, communication that is clear with routine update and accurate about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and therapy plans and use device and professional electronic applications to avoid contact near each other.
The effective Vaksins are very important to unused the transmisi chain of animals and humans are infected to the rented insecurities and often equipped therapies in control of the epidemis due to the existence of the virus.
Upaya has been done to develop a protein-based vaccine of S, which is long-termly and effectively made the antibodies and/or immunity that protects SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-based vaccines have been distributed to experiment animals.
Nevertheless, the vivo efficiency of this vaccine at thesia and the risk model and its protection of the zoonotic virus infection still has to be determined before the clinis studi began.
It's probably because SARS had 17 years ago and there was no new case being reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic and MERS clasters have continued to go to the Middle East and spread to other areas because they have continued to have a petnotic source in the province.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MER by using an disabled virus, DNA narcomid, virus vectors, particles, particles, viruslike particles, and subuniting protein recombinants and some have been distributed in the experimental animals.
A vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 safe and effective for non-imuns is a very urgent and important task to control the current epidemi.
However, these problems are not easy for long time to develop vaccines (e. 18 months) and variations of the dynamite CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started showing a full clinic trip on thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be cured without measure.
However, it is similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19, also associated with high morbidity and mortality to patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, prognosis models are very important for health care bodys to share his services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on a chlinist study that is reported so far, the following factors can affect or associate with CVID-19 patient prognosis (Tabel 3):
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for the SARS prognosis, which also happened to CVID-19.
COVID-19 is especially happening at the age of 30-55 years with 47,7% patients above 50 years in the study contains 8866 cases as explained above.
The patient who needs intensive treatment tends to have the union comorbidity and compilation and often signifies older than patients who do not need intensive care (nown 66 years) than 51, which defines age as prognostic factor for the end of the CVID-19 patient.
Type of clamin: SARS-CoV-2 is more investigating men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0,27/100,000), as explained above.
Commorbidity and compilation: Casien COVID-19 who needs intensive treatments have more likely to have a capital heart injury and aritmic experience.
The heart events also have a major reason for death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reported also to present a colangiocy with ACE2-posiitive, which can lead to the heart of CIVD-19 patients.
It is important that age and disease are based on very harmony and can affect each other.
The abnormal laboratory: C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in blood reflects the efficientity of the inflamation or network injury and collabosis as potential prognostic factor for disease, responses to therapy, and final recovery.
Korelation between CRP rates and paraphrases and CVID-19 prognosiss have also been taken.
Moreover, the increase of the dehidrogene (LDH), aspart of aminotransferase (AST), alanin amirantferase (ALT), and chreatin kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These Enzims are highly expressed in various organs, especially in hearts and heart, and released during the network damage.
Therefore, these enzims are traditional markers for heart and heart function.
The main clinis: Photo toraks and the development of temporal clinics should be considered together with other things to predict the end result and compilation CVID-19.
steroid use: As explained above, steroid is an imunosupresan which is used as a constant therapy for infection disease to reduce inflatibility.
Because of the high dosis cor Hayesteroid dose in severe SARS patients, many of the survivors of this disease eventually suffered an avascular osteonosis with the rest of life and bad quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid must be used on a lower dose and a short period of time to COVID-19 patient.
Mentional pressure: As explained above, during the outbreak of COVD-19, many patients suffer severe stress because they have to exercise long - term karantina and unemployment and watch the death of close family members and the patients.
Conseling psychology and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to the demography study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different image of epidemiologicals.
Besides replications on the lower internction channel, SARS-CoV-2 can form efficiently on the top calibration channel and cause light symptoms or without symptoms at the beginning of infection, similar to other coVs that cause turbulence.
Therefore, at the early phase or the time of inkubation, infected patients can produce a virus in a large amount of day-day activity, which is causing great trouble to control epidemi.
However, the SARS-CoV dipercaya transmisi is happening when patients are severe and most of them are not in early phases.
That way, COVID-19's plague is far worse and hard to control from the SARS plague.
At this time, the great effort is being done in Tiongkok, which includes the Wuhan provinces and cities around and the carantinas continue almost the entire population with hope of conduit SARS-CoV-2 transmisi.
Even though this action is very ruining economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients are coming down, which indicate epidemi delay.
The most optimistic Estation tells us that the plague will end in March and the phases of the drop last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not the same.
Paul Hunter et al. I appreciate that COVID-19, which seems much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. make models to predict the end of the episode and declare that SARS-CoV-2 can detect two global populations.
The Canadian researcher reports that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-konka and patient throats who were recovered and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier.
However, the signs of promised to happen in Tiongkok, if it's seen by the dropdown of a new case, which shows that the current strategy might work.
Ebolas reprediction will cause one million cases with half death.
However, with the carantina and obsolete, this disease can finally be handled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has weakened his ability to detect and finally disappear or become a virus not too patogen that can have a relationship with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 with the epidemi SARS and MERS is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy being transferred through coughs or insects, and maybe also through direct contact with materials that are contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found on feses so that it's possible a new transmisi, which is a transmisi feses-to-lut.
A recent study at 138 cases reported that 41% cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health treatment providers.
Therefore, careful treatments must be done to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who happen to be infected with patients or infected.
The first defense Lini can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgeon masks and N95's respirators (e.e. 1860-an) help control the virus penyebaran.
The operating masks keep that the ludahs potentially infected people or attached to the surface of the material, where the ludah sparks can continue to others.
However, only the N95 masker (nomor series 1860-an) can protect against virion inhalation with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can concentrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV in size, both are considered about 85 nm.
Because the particles can renetrate even five surgeons assigned to one, a direct medical treatment provider with patients must wear N95 (e. g. 1860-an) and not the operating mask.
In addition to the masker, health treatment providers have to wear a pasole garment to reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also detect someone through his eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wears N95 masks; the virus might go into his body through the eyedom.
Because of that, health treatment providers also have to wear the shield of eyes or glasses as long as they work with patients.
For the general society in the region that has been credentials or potentially attached, it is very suggested for everyone to wash his hands with soaps are often more commonly, trying to stay at home in the house of the rug, and avoid contact with the potentially infected people.
Three feet are suspected to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus penyebarans.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologist with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for Tiongkok who had a strong memory of the SARS outbreak of 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan’s disease Control tells the people that this new virus has the quality of the penyebaran and the limited reproductive capacity of human beings to men and prevention and to prevent this disease is not a problem.
This message is very calm in the fear of society, especially when the whole country is preparing the Winter Semi Festival, so that this critical time is late to block the disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The body of disease in Tiongkok should take lessons from this and make great repairs in the future.
For example, these bodys should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive information than waiting for official reports from a doctor or authorities; (3) more concerned to block the potential in the early stage, and not try to ease public; and (4) more often disabling public training and ability to improve public awareness of public disease and efficibility in the system’s system’s environments disease and the environment.
The COVD-19 Wabah is due to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout the Tiongkok and over 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVD-19 and SARS also similar, the CARS outbreak of CID-19 has affected like the SARS plague again.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is very important to block epidemi and handle patients.
COVID-19 is more than young people and more about men than women, and death is also higher than young people.
The SARS Mortality is higher than the 19 CVID-19 (10,91% of 1,44%).
The CIVD-19 Pasien transisiates the virus even when they're without symptoms, while SARS patients are usually transplanting the virus when they're sick, this makes more trouble in blocking the CVID-19 penyebaran than SARS.
It explains some reason why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
A regular RNA Asai to check SARS-CoV-2 can give a negative result in some COVD-19 patients.
On the other hand, a sick patient can give more positive results on the virus check.
This meeting is very likely to increase the risk of virus witnessing.
As soon as the progress of COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although the genetic homology was found about 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV similar-SARS bat bat, we still haven't been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bat.
What animal became an internship species to transfer the virus from the original interior, say bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer of number 1 and 2, we can't remutate transmisis effectively and outbreaks can spread back every second.
Although moleculer and biochemy acids indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is giving up with ACE2, how exactly is the virus going into the breathline cell and cause further patological changes?
Does this virus also have a cell expressing the ACE2 in another organ?
Without a clear answer for these questions, we can't reach fast and accurate and effective treatment.
How long will this episode take place?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmisi between humans?
Is this pandemi going to be a whole world's pandemi, end up like SARS, or resurfaced like a flu?
The answer to questions above and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
However, whatever it takes, we have no other choice but to stop this episode as soon as possible to get back to a normal life.
The original zoonotic human chronic virus.
For thousands of years, mutation and adapt have moved the corona virus and the instrument, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause a mild disease, such as fluesma.
A heavy quant synthesis syndrome and Central East Eastern syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveal how much HCoV infection can be very damaged and threatening the soul.
The Muncul SARS-CoV-2 at Tiongkok center in the end of 2019 has made CoV sorotes back and surprises us with high transmissions, but with a lower quality than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV's insects are zoonosis because that's why, HCoV's original understanding would be useful for us.
Most of the HCoV comes from bats on this animal, the virus is not a patogenic.
Some HCoV can also be known.
The animal’s indentification has direct application in human disease control.
CoV-inang's interactive research on animals can also give a very important thought about patogenesis CoV on humans.
In this review, we're suggesting the common knowledge of the seven HCoV, by focusing on the history of his discovery and the origin of the zoonotic and the interseces.
The important thing is, we're compareing and seizing the HCoV from the point of evolutionic view and recombination of genome.
Epidemi CoV 2019 (COVD-19) is present in this context.
In addition, the constellation of the instrument that succeeds and implications the evolution of the virus in the paramiles of disease is also interpreted.
The coV virus is from the Coronaviridae family, which is made up of a bunch of RNA viruss, inflamed, positive, and single bee.
This virus has the largest genome with the size of 26 to 32 kilobasa among the RNA virus called "CoV", because his morfology is like a crown under electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has unregnizable genome that has similar tiredes.
Some of the two thirds of the genome are composed of two large open outlines (ORF1b and ORF1b) which is overlapping. Both are transplanted into pp1a and pp1ab replication poliprotein.
Poliprotein has further processing to form 16 nonstructal proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genomes consisted of open read order (ORF) for structureal proteins, which include tonjolan or spike (S), a cellubung or a envelope (E), membrane (M), and noloprotein (N).
A number of specific proteins for a specific line of descent are also recommended by various CoV descendants of the CoV.
Based on the difference of protein sequens, CoV is recommended to be four genuss (alfa-CoV, iV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); between the fourth of the genus, the EV-CoV is most HCoV and is divided to four lines (A, B, C, C, and D).
The filogenetic evidence indicates that the bats and the resilient animals are the source of the genes of the alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while unggas are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV continues to cross the barrier of species and some CoV has become an important patogen to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs.
Among the seven viruss, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other coV-coV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1's corona synthematical syndromes are heavy (SARS-CoV), a central Eastern syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually causes light symptoms, such as pilek and/or diare.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patogenic, causing a deep breath infection in the relative of many patients and has a higher chance to develop into a quant disorder syndrome and manifest outside of the lung organ.
The first HCoV-229E Strain, Bhttp, is disfellowshipped of a fluctuated patient in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, the more knowledge is gathered through a deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused a cure.
In fact, this concept has been received vastly that the HCoV infection is commonly harmless, until the SARS outbreak is happening.
The SARS Wabah that happened in 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks in history today, which is investing over 2,000 people with a rough death number about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle Eastern arts (MERS) syndrome caused an epidemi to continue in the Arab Semenanjung by preaching sporadics to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), the next name SARS-CoV-2, is an agent of the epidemi epirona disease 2019 (COVD-19), which has taken its life over 3.120 people and educated more than 91.000 people until 3 March 2020.
It's been sounding and the world has to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2- coming.
These seven HCoVs all have the origin of the zoonotics from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence support the origin of the evolution of all the HCoV of bats in bats, CoV has a well-daptized and unparaptogenic, but it shows a large genetic monkey.
Epidemi CVID-19 has caused medical challenges, scientific, social, and great morals for Tiongkok and the whole world.
HCoV's original zoonotics give a job frame to understand natural history, alarmal resources, and the environmental factor happens between species.
This study can also drive or detect the search of reservoir animals, interservoirs, intersects, and SARS-CoV-2, which has an important application in the penyebaran prevention in the next time.
In this review, we give the common image of the zoonotic, interspesies transmisi, and patogenesis HCoV.
We're specially identified and discussed the general subject that the HCoV's mother virus is usually non-patogenic in its natural reservoir, but being patogenic after the intersecesion transmission to the new interior.
We're also considering HCoV's evolution that the increase of transmisi abilities is often accompanied by a drop of trinity.
The end of the SARS-CoV-2 episode is also presented in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E encoded the first D.C.E. from the patient ingus, various CoV has been distributed from various infected animals, which include kalkuns, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few basewars, seven HCoV has been identified.
The short Rangkuman history of HCoV's discovery in the chronological order (Tabel 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E research was distributed from the patient's breath channel that had a breath infection above the 1966, which was later adapted to the lining of the WI-38 lung cell.
The patients of HCoV-229E are showing fluesma symptoms, which include headaches, disarming, and throat disease, with fevers and rocks seen at 10~20% cases.
Next year in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was removed from the organ cultures and a series of seriess in the brains that were still intersect.
The picture of HCoV-OC43 infections seems to be similar to infections because of HCoV-229E, which isally unreliable with other pernapasary patogen infections such as the virus influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread throughout the world and tends to be more efficient during the winter in the weather.
Normally, the time these two viruss are less than a week and are followed by a sick time for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected by HCoV-229E has a lightweight cellesma.
It's just a little patient with a weak body’s immeasurable sistim that shows the infection of a heavy breath channel.
SARS, known as "pneumonia atipis", is the first HCoV that was documented well in human history and his etiology agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
SARS’s first case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in the Guangdong province, Tiongkok.
Epidemi SARS caused 8.096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread throughout many countries and continents.
Instead of superulars, every case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with a time of inkubation 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus load is seen on the 10th day of disease.
SARS-CoV's patients were beginning to suffer mialgians, headaches, fevers, and crazy, followed by dispnea, rocks, and breath disorders as further symptoms.
Limfopenia, irregular heart function tests, and the increase of creatin cinase is a common laboratory in SARS.
The damage in the alveolar, the epitel cell proliferation, and the acceleration of the marofag is also observed to the SARS patient.
Next, about 20-30% patients need intensive care and mekanical ventilation.
In addition to the underlying channels, some organs that include gastrointestinal channels, hearts, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually along with satokin storms, which can turn off, especially in the weak patients.
The first virus was disolated from the biopsy of the zero patient's patient's relative who was traveling to Hong Kong from Hystri.
Since then, the effort was highly developed for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7 months from the Netherlands in the end of 2004.
These viruss were initially very common to young, old, and weak patients who were suffering from physical disease.
Koriza, cotoritivitis, fever, and bronkiolitis are common to disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus amolation from the necimen of the 8-year-old boy who suffered pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Dutch, this virus actually spread throughout the world.
It's estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4,7% common exercise disease and the top of the event happened at the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive escapes, called corruption.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was deprecated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated in the roof because of pneumonia and bronkiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides the pneumonia and bronchiolity of community, HCoV-HKU1 reported to the aquarity release.
So far as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found all over the world, cause a lighty exercise disease.
The four HCoV community community has been adapted to human beings and most commonly had a small possibility of being a very patogen disease, even though, an unusual case is happening because of some unknown reason, such as in the case of the HCoV-NL63 subrulen case recently reported that these recently caused a heavy breath infection under Tiongkok.
Generally, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend themselves in human beings, viruency and the HCoV quality also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the 60-year-old patient patients who had a little pneumonia and failed kidneys in the Arab Saudi.
Although most cases are confirmed by the laboratory from Central Eastern, the import case sometimes in the secondary penyebaran to a close contact has been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary show occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The M.S. clinical Manifestation is similar to SARS, which is related to the progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also failed myth kidneys, which just happened to MERS among the diseases of HCoV.
More than 30% patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, like diare and pudled.
Until February 14, 2020, over 2500 the laboratory cases are reported with a high case death, which is a 344%, making MERS-CoV into one of the most scary virus known by humans.
In the mid to the end of December 2019, the pneumonia patient clasters are directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection found in Wuhan, the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of the lower breath infections of breath infection and because of SARS-CoV-2 as the Global Health Emergency and named the CID-19.
Until March 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed in the world, with a severe death figure of 3,4%.
It needs to be recorded, the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, as much as 4,2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy exercise infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever images, rocks, and breaths.
Diare was also found on a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy symptoms and can develop quickly into a quart breath disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because the high nucleotida sequence of nucleoda sequences, as well as 82%, both are computing into a different phylogenetic tree branch.
SARS-CoV-2's abduction is lower, but more contagious than with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's infected Subject without symptoms have been reported and may have been in the fast SARS-CoV-2 field throughout the world.
Interesting and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCoVs show the equation and a very interesting difference.
First of all, the time of tubes and the way of HCoV's disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follow the common tren of six HCoVs.
Second, COVVD-19 is located between SARS-CoV-CoV and four other community HCoV-229E (icode HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common description of the HCoV Community infection, which includes the image of the light nonsecific nonsive or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a little bit of COVD-19's case can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a little lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmisi also show interesting pattern characteristics, have a consequency with HCoV or SARS-CoV.
On one side, the SARS-CoV-2 transmisi abilities are at least equal to the same height of the community HCoV.
On the other hand, it's not that SARS-CoV-2 transmission ability after some lines on humans still need to be defined, as the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Last time, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a sample of feses.
"Is SARS-CoV-2 fekal-oral-oral-oral functional, like in the case of SARS-CoV transmisies, at least in a certain situation, it still has to be identified by the next studi. "
The thing that's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a season like in the case of community HCoV.
In any case, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmisial abilities, patogenity, and the spread of several lines on humans, will be deeply affected by the end of the COVD-19.
Four HCoV communityity that causes light symptoms all have adapted to humans.
It's seen from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, well HCoV and humans may be the species of an ancient HCoV's navigator.
HCoV has caused a heavy disease to happen to humans and humans who have suffered heavy HCoV’s illness has been destroyed.
In order to do this, HCoV has to form in human beings in enough amounts to allow a adaptive mutation to resist the factor of the inang limitation.
In this way, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks endure and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is adaptable to human beings.
If the virus is adapted properly, its transmission on humans will be difficult to stop with karantina or other infections.
For years, four CoV community communitys have been left in human populations and triggering cells to an imunocompatibility.
This virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are very obsogenic not adapted to humans and its transmission in human beings can't be preserved.
Both must defend themselves and do reproduce in the zoonotic reservoirs and find a chance to spread to a vulnerable human target, perhaps through one or some intercessor and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a description similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communityity.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy being transferred like HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more patogenic than HCoV communityity and not as good as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Still must be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to human beings and collateralized in humans without a reservoir or intersect.
Before considering the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutiononer, natural, reservoirs, intersects, and HCoV.
Hewans act as a HCoV's evolutionary in order to have an intimate ancestor and share high homology at an acceleotida level.
An ancestor’s virus usually adapts well and is non-internal in thisang.
Similarly, the reservoirs brought HCoV further and in the long run.
In those cases, the intuition is naturally infected and is natural inang for HCoV or the parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV just entered the intersect before or about the virus goes into humans, the virus has not been adapted to a new instrument and often has been passively.
This intercessor can work as a source of human infections and act as an instructor by allowing the virus to be applied temporarily, then transfer it to human beings to a human infection.
HCoV can experience a buntu infection if it can't maintain its transmission in the internship.
Rather, HCoV can also adapt to the internternation and even cause long - term endemicity.
In this case, the internship became a natural reservoir.
The epidemiology data revealed directly that SARS zero case has a history of contact with the hunt animals.
The next co-expression study indicates that the animal sales have an anti-SARS-CoV commonrity common population.
The moon Mosesng (Alarvata Paguma) and the larvata dog in the market of life is the first to be identified to bring a virus similar to the SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identified with SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that there is no more SARS case reported since all the musangs in the market were killed.
That is the case, it is reported that the moon musang of the wild or the farm which is not identified to the market of the animals of life gives a negative test for SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, because 80% of various animals in the market of the U.S.S.-CoV antibodi, can't be confirmed that many of the species of small mammals are also working as SARS-CoV.
All these inangs seem to be the end of SARS-CoV.
A natural animal search for SARS-CoV next revealed a close-trailed CoV, called CoV bat Rhinolopus relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tiongkok horse bat.
This bat gives a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV anti-coV antibodi and a sARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
This CoV and the other bat CoV shares the nucleotida nucleoda 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study became a foundation for a new concept that the bat is aang for a new human patogen.
Some CoV similar-SARS (SL-CoV) also identified from bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Agiotension modifier 2 (ACE2) known is a SARS-CoV prescriptor.
WIV1 which comes from the sample of bat feses is shown using ACE2 bats, musangs, and man as a recipetor to enter into the cell.
Interesting thing, SARS patient serum convalesen can connect WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most intimate ancestor with SARS-CoV at the bat, with the holmology of the nucleotida of 95%.
The homological height between these two viruss is generally believed that WIV1 isn't a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and the bat isn't a direct reservoir SARS-CoV.
The filogenetic analysis is compiling MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bat and CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV uses the same inang prescription, which is called a 4-DPP4-inch, as a way in the virus.
Sequens RNA polymerase depends on-RNA MERS-CoV filogenetis closely near the match in the quantity of the bat-coV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, there are no MERS-CoV living found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and her closest relative of CoV-HKU25 bat shares 87% homology as a nucleotida.
That's why, bats may not be the directly interservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East showed that the Arab camels gave the results of a specific antibodi that promote MERS-CoV, the same as the Middle East camel in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lived an identification with a virus found in the human being found from the Arab camels weap, this is further indicate that the camel is the actual reservoir inviation for MERS-CoV.
It's also important that the synthematical virus bullet with a commonly lighted symptoms of experimental camels that are detected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the camels that are infected are not just through the resemblance routes, but also through fecal-oral routes, which are the main path of the virus bulletping from the bat.
However, the question is still unanswered because many MERS cases have no contact history with camels before the symptoms, perhaps the result of human transmisions or the transmission routes that are unknown to the species of unrecognised animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96,2% nukleotida homology with CoV bat RaTG13 which is isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to set the parent connection.
In other words, bats may not be the direct inservoir of SARS-CoV-2, except if CoV bat is almost found later.
It's possible that SARS-CoV-2's intersects are among the species of wild satwas that sold and killed at the Huan Food Food Market, many cases early COVD-19 are related to this market, which indicate the possibility of a transmisi-human.
Some latest studies based on metagenomic quantities indicate that a bunch of small mammals are threatened, known as trenggiling (Manis javanica), also may bring me-CoV an immigration with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV genom Conggiling shares 85-92 homology as a nucleotida with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is equal to RaTG13 with the same equal to 90% on the acceleotida sequency level.
Both are grouped into two subgaris-geneutical viruss like SARS-CoV-2 in filogenetic tree, one of which shares a prescriptor binding domain that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with the same as the same as the amino acid of 97,4%.
The thing that's drawn, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is much more different, even if the highest homology level of the entire genome.
A previous study on a sick trenggiling also reported a virus contig detector from a lung sample, which it turns out to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of instrument and manual quaracy to produce a parsial genome that is composed of about 86,3% of a complete virus genome.
We can't intersect the possibility of trenggiling as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intervens.
But now there's no evidence that supporting SARS-CoV-2 is coming directly from trenggiling because of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and my relative-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 tenggling.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and my relative-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary line of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, trenggiling, and the other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest homology on the RBD found between SARS-CoV-2 and my dear relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the entire genome.
It's too significant if it's said that the highest level of the respect between my RBD-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling and SARS-CoV-2 was moved by the evolution of the convention.
Hipotesis collaboration supports recombination between my brother-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling and RaTG13 in third wild species.
As a evolutionary alarm factor, a lot of recombination is happening between my Ku-CoV.
Researchers are still not able to decide the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to a very passive HCoV-HKU1's original bionotic HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been translated.
The filogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from CoV bat, while the HCoV-OC43 virus and HCoV-HKU1 was found in therat animal.
It's reported that CoV bats named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) are being detected in the three North American bats indicate the efficiency near HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is geneticized with the other CoV batwar, with the names of Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which is detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also expected to be his intercede.
In order to be clear, the knowledge of this moment about the origin of HCoV animals known in the image 1 and Tabel 2.
The filogenetic analysis has given evidence of intersecesion HCoV's intersecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 came across species of cattle to detect humans, there was an accountal infection.
HCoV-229E transmission history is not too clear.
The alpha-CoV bat is a matched bat with HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them, there's an alpaka alpha-CoV.
Some evidence support the transmisi virus directly from bats to humans.
First, man, not an alpaka, which might be constraint with bats in the ecological relung together.
In contrast, people have a close contact with alpaka.
Second, the bat alpha-CoV is related to HCoV-229E there are many and non-patogenics in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaka caused a renect disease on infected animals.
Last time, the alpaka alpha-CoV was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, it's possible that alpaka gets an alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E of humans can't be attached.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human patogenic virus, which includes rabies viruss, Ebola viruss, Nipah viruss, and Hendra viruss.
Therefore, it's not too surprising that the bats may directly transfer the H.CoV-229E to mankind.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV bat works as the HCoV-229E gene lungs, alpaka and Arab camels may work as a intersect that transfers the virus to humans, just like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for intersecution transmission from bat to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV's evolutioner from the bat known at the initial identification of the virus and is also reinforced with the date after it.
It is obvious that bats are a rich virus species for intersecessies and interspesies transmissions.
It's a long, colonie that's intersection, close social interaction, and strong flying ability, all are a supportive condition for bat to become an ideal virus pen.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV's been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to camels that have changed from the internship into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes a very light disease and maintain the lower mutation speed in this animal.
His sporadic transmission happens by chance and humans remain the end of the MERS-CoV because the transmission can't continue.
Unlike the intersection of camels in MERS-CoV transmisi, trenggiling, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmisies different.
Especially, I-CoV trenggiling is very dangerous in trenggiling.
Tenggiling may be the final instrument for my SARS-CoV-CoV-2 relatives, similar to the musang in the case of SARS-CoV.
On the studis coming, some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmisi intersecies from animals to humans should be viewed or across.
First, the bat could be a reservoir invigoir for SARS-CoV-2's relative virus that almost identic with SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological resecurs with bats through the buyer or bara rock mines.
Second, the trenggiling could be one of the intersects for the SARS-CoV-2 relatives's new in.
People get a virus through the slaughter and consume the hunting meat.
Maybe, many mammals, which include pets, vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodi Survei against pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adapting SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that are good at bats and trenggiling.
SARS-CoV-2's original search still last.
Takes out of various kinds of animal inangs, three main factors from the virus side are also important to simplify CoV across species barriers.
First, the speed of the mutation is relative to the RNA replication.
Compared with another single RNA virus, the rate of coV's mutation can be considered "while" to "height" with the average substitution of ~10-4 per year, depending on CoV adaptation of the new inang.
CoV has an exoribonuklease of detecting, removal that causes very high mutivity, independent, or even inviabilities.
Interesting thing, the nuclear analog Redesivir was known to press CoV repplication through this exoperation inhibision and RNA polymerase hanging-RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2's most promising agents that will be tested in the clinical experiments.
However, the CoV mutation speed is about a million times higher than the instrument speed.
Besides, mutation speeds are often high when CoV has not adapted to inangs.
Assuming the SARS-CoV with high mutation speed, SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, predicting higher adaption rates with humans.
It's possible, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another influencing in between humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also happening to MERS-CoV who have adapted an Arab camel.
Theoretically, it's a small possibility that genetic negotiations will quickly make a vaccine and agent agent against SARS-CoV-2 become less effective.
Second, the big RNA genome in CoV gives extra constellations in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, so increase the cobabilities of interspesies, which are useful to show him the new CoV when the conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a number of open read outlines unique and protein functions that are recommended at the end of 32,000 genome.
Third, CoV often changes the template randomly during RNA replication through unique "option-salin" mechanism.
In aang that works as a collision, an alternate transcension of RNA CoV.
The complete RNA and a very homologic subgenomic can have a recombination to form a new CoV.
The natural recombination evidence was found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, so at CoV animals like SL-CoV bat bat and CoV-HKUU9 bat.
Interactions of viruss in connection with transmissions
In addition to three virus factors mentioned above, virus interactors with inang recipes are another factor that affects interspesies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered as an example of special, which also indicates a positive selection during interspesies transmission.
According to a collaboration analysis between the SARS-CoV-coV SARS and musang, SARS-CoV expected to be adapted quickly in many in ranges, especially with mutation on protein RBD.
Generally, the S CoV protein RBD interacted with the cell recipetor and intensively into the target of antibodi inang responses.
On SARS-CoV, RBD is a three-18 amino acid to the 510th of S1 fragment, which gives the ACE2 human and his corescriptors as a virus entrance.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 prescription of various animals, which include bats, musangs, rats, and dogs, so allow the transmisi virus interspesies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid resemblants are in different between human virus Isolats and musangs in RBD and 4 are located at the recipetor's binding motive for interaction with ACE2 recipetors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T at his RBD, which may increase tonjolan protein interaction with the ACE2 recipe.
In other words, these two amino acid substitution may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell prescriptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV unit S1 protein S1 has published afinity of S protein S with ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows afinity of the ACE2 binding and the SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than afinity between ACE2 humans and SARS-CoV proteins.
It's also important to know if there's another corespector that might be necessary for the SARS-CoV-2 transmision.
Interesting thing, HCoV-NL63 also has a favor with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV prescriptors, like aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and a goddamn acid 9-O-tersetilation for HCoV-OC43.
These rhetors may also be involved in the success of this CoV adaption in humans after the intersecesion transmission of the animal.
In addition to the cell recipe, the end of HCoV transmisi betweenspesies is also organized by the dependencies and other inang bounds.
These inang protein differences between humans and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, andrat animals can be a barrier to interspesies transmission.
HCoV must take over the consecutive consecutive factor and block the insecration factor to succeed in interspesies transmission.
In this case, molecular molecules in the field of these important virus interactions still have to be identified and maintained.
The whole genome filters are not cripple to see the depending and constraints of SARS-CoV-2 in use the CRISPR technology may be useful.
It's a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the plague.
CoV bat's religion has a big chance to show him a new HCoV.
In this case, CoV bat works as a HCoV gene.
In addition, genetic mutation and recombination also motivated the evolution of HCoV and functioned as two important steps in this process.
For example, getting or losing a new protein derivative gene has potentially modified the virus fenotics.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to be involved in human adaptation because relatives-SARS-CoV viruss found a displaced ORF8 protein.
SARS-CoV with the special aspects of removal 29 nucleotida was found on a significant force at the beginning of the human epidemi.
This eraser splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and expected to be an adaptive mutation supporting the inang transition.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase that depends on RNA.
Recombination location also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination events between many races are shown in the epidemi MERS-CoV, which happened in the Arab camels in the Arab Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination was also observed on HCoV where HCoV had a recombination with the other coV animal in his nonstructal gene.
Also, it must be observed that artificial selection can be involved in an inescapable change on the virus genome, likely caused by the release of the virus of the selection, such as the insect system.
This effect is missing ORF4 complete on the HCoV-229E prototype of removal two nucleotida.
While ORF4 intact can be observed on bat viruss and camels that are related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka indicates a single nucleotida side that causes a series of quality.
Last, the evolution of the new HCoV was moved by the selection pressure in the reservoir.
The light or without the symptoms are detected when the bat is infected by CoV, which shows between CoV and bat.
Looks like bats are adapting well with CoV by anaatomy and fisiology.
For example, malformed on proinflamation responses on bat will lower the pathology of CoV by efisien.
In addition, a natural killer's cell activity on bat was pressed because of the increase of the regulator of a killer's natural procurator NKG2/CD94/CD94-and level the level of complex molecular molecular molecular histocity of the main class I class.
In addition, the amount of oxygen reactive (ROS) species of high-level metalbolic metabolic activity can press CoV's repplication and affect the detection of exoribonuklease so that giving pressure to the creation of the virus that is highly obligatory while entering into the new inang.
The more patogenic Strain may also grow through the recombination, which causes the protein or the new protein feature to adapt inang.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that the new three HCoV has appeared in the last two basewars.
CoV is non-paratogenic or causes a light symptoms in its reservoir, like bats and camels.
CoV is a strong lookout without triggering a powerful inang response.
Here's the secret of a driver without symptoms and the cause of a heavy case on a human infection.
Prides are especially because of extreme responses and a lone storm, with a deeper lung damage if the responses are getting stronger.
On the other hand, on the unemployment driver, the imunt response has escaped from CoV repplication.
The same strategy to decide imuncient responses might be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong on bat.
That's why, the interferon type I, at least the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be useful.
Besides, inflamasom NLRP3 activation in the bat is unpredictable.
With this reason, the inflamas of NLRP3 with MC950 may be useful in COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 has followed the common alur of the CARS-CoV appearance and MERS-CoV.
While I-CoV bat-coV shares 95% the nucleotida homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there are CoV bats that shares 96% nukleotida homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the other musang and other animals on the market were found to bring a virus identified to SARS-CoV, the direct intercessor for SARS-CoV-2 not found.
A very homologing beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that trenggiling may be one of the internships or me-CoV trenggiling may give a gen fragmention at the end of SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although it's still been questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by a good man deliberately or intentionally.
CoV came back to the attention center because the SARS-CoV-2 plague has recently.
CoV's study in bats and other animals have been very different about the importance of the origin of zoonotic and animal reservoirs for the HCoV on human transmission.
So many evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 is from bat and transferred to human beings through the intersequency.
Remembering that SARS-CoV infections come from contact between humans and musangs in wet markets, perhaps detainers of wet markets and all muscular killings in it that end SARS episodes effectively.
With the same reason, the trenggiling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent the transmission of the zoonotic transmisi, since there's an discovery of some of my descendants-CoV trenggiling lines that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism is transferred to humans through the trenggiling and other mammals still have to be classified in research at the time of the coming.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in an Arab camel.
It works as an important transporting tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, skin, and wol products for local society.
The Arab Unta spread wide throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't possibly kill all camels to control MERS, as done at the market of wild animals in Tiongkok to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, the comprehensive approach must be done to develop vaccines for effective camels to MERS-CoV and combined with other infection measures.
Before we get rid of this virus, the new genotype can appear and cause a plague.
It's like CoV zoonotic goes on in wild nature.
Especially, CoV bats are potentially potentially vibrations.
There's a lot of chance for CoV zoonotics to transform and experience recombination, which leads to a new CoV which is easier to retranimize and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
The culture eats wild animals in some places in Tiongkok must be abandoned to reduce contact that doesn't need between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, U.S.A., and COVID-19, preparation and a better reconstruction plan should be applied.
Actually, a lot of viruss have been on this planet ever since.
These viruss are in his natural reservoirs until there's a chance to preach.
Although the bat has many features that support the spread of the virus, the opportunity of humans is crouched with bats and other wild species can be predicted if people die to avoid wild animals.
Surveilans continue to be done with mammals to understand more about the ecology of CoV and the natural interior, which will prove to be beneficial in preventing human-human transmisions and plagues.
In a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoos is that humans have to keep the distance from the specology reservoir of the natural animalnotic virus.
Some parts of SARS-CoV-2 puzzle have not been found.
First, if the bats are transplanted the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the trenggiling, conditions when bat and trenggiling share ekological relungs are important to know.
Second, if the bat has a more direct role in transmisies to humans, the way human beings are introduced with bats must be determined.
Third, if there are third mammals that are actually intervening, the way they interact with other species, which include humans, bats, and trenggiling should be explained.
Finally, because of many mammals, including pets that might be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, well experiment infections and surveys should be done.
Either bats, trenggiling, or other mammals, expected that SARS-CoV-2 or her parents' viruss almost identified in her natural in the future.
The continue research in this field will decipher the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with a significant application in control and CVID-19 control on humans.
Ingnostic dignostic dignostic "ense sensitive" and "sequency confirmed" CVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published the quick advice for dignosis and new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and our knowledge has increased on the development of research and the practical experience of clinis; therefore, the diagnosis and regnosis strategies are also updated.
In this letter, we answered one of our comments and provided our recent diagnostic criteria for the "respected" and "sonfirmation" by the Diagnosis Guides and impension for CVID-19 (the seventh version) which was released by the National Health of the National Republic of Tiongkok.
In December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has led a outbreak, which is now called a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) and the virus is given the name of the quanaviruse syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemi.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infections, our team developed a quick advice and the guide has been published by the Medical Military Research on February 6 2020.
The guide has been a lot of attention since it was published.
However, the need to be noted that COVD-19 is a new disease, awareness and our knowledge has increased in progress, as well as a clinis practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and retinations are also updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and the Constraint for COVD-19’s National Health Committee Commissions of the Tiongkok National Committee (http://www.ncn.cn.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to March 2020, this commission has removed the entire seven edition of the context has been changed enough.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al, they introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guidance and being a precious reference to this environment around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work is also needed to update by Diagnosis Guides and Constraints for the latest COVD-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm an unexpected case is required of a combination of epidemiology history with two clinic manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or need to compatibility three clinissation if there is no clear episode history:
epidemiologys: (1) travel history or living in the city of Wuhan and the region around it, or other community where COVD-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the death of SARS-CoV-2, a contact with a positive nucleat acid case (with a positive nuclear acid)); (3) the contact history of patients with the city or synthematical areas of the city of Wuhan and, or the other publicity of the last day before the news has been reported in the news of the news with a synthetical condition of the case; or the case of the school, like a small, two weeks, or the case of a test of a test.
Clinist Manifestation: (1) fever and/or synthematical symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection feature; (3) total numerics of white blood cells indicate the limfosition count of normal limfosits, down, or less at the initial acceleration level.
Degreing a known case should be based on an unexpected case with one of the evidence patogenic or econology as the following: (1) a positive PCR-time test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a full-CoV-2 virus expression indicates a new homogenity for new coronavirus known; (3) positive for the Ignation of the IgV2 Ig and antibodicies of SARCOV2; or the IVVVVV2 version of the change of the positivelysis.
We can see that the real PCR test of a nucleat acid in the samples of the pernapas or blood is added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The patogenic detection of the blood samples is added to the fourth edition of 2.7 January 2020) and the fifthth (8 February 2020); then, the specology evidence is added to the seventh edition.
This Modification is based on continued research research research to find the image of an optimal acid to diagnosis quickly, and samples of the breath channel including blood flow, which increases various spaces, and support the positive acceleration of the antibodiment into the confirmation.
Besides, there's more evidence that reminds us to keep an eye on the patient with the arithmetic symptoms and no symptoms.
That's why, that's the form of Zhou et al. It's gonna have to be updated because they recommend people with no clinical symptoms as a low give.
The score system also needs to be specified in the prektik and chlinis study in the future.
As a limp, we hope more directly evidence will appear and ask the reader to give a comment.
To the unexpected "sequently" and "sectioned", we suggest to follow and follow the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also update our manual for help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVD-19, the highest death rate.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths of CVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the amount of infections recorded in between 114 of active cases and 33 cases that are living at home.
It's recorded 17 deaths.
In some unlimied news, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death covers four men and a woman.

Toko-toko in Australia sent the toilet buyout limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth's store and Coles each drops the toilet buyout limit to two and one mergers in all the stores on the national level.
A ALDI also applied one limit, on Monday.
This limitation is announced as a message in the sand and on the Facebook network page.
The buyer reported the preparations of CVID-19's fear if the people had to do a self-relication.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also exceeded the toilet drive buyer for delivery to the house to one order sir.
This change is following the four comms per transactions that were applied to Woolworths and Coles each at 4 and 5 March.
On the media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the 4-depending, "many stores are still out in one hour since the delivery", and call the request "belum ever happened," while ALD, in a Facebook posting on Tuesday, it says "untrusted".
The "Clattering" last week, according to one of the Woolworths talks.
Costco shops in Canberra also exceeded the amount that was allowed to two weeks ago.
In order to avoid resumption, Coles ordered the tidy more than resemblancing frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALI made preparations for special Wednesday’s promosi activities are available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Price, said that the fairytel tried to improve supplies, but the local government limit for the time of the truck delivery made it difficult.
It replaces production fee rates, as long as the suppliers try to meet the request, and a little bit of special promotions.
On Tuesday, the ALD announces that because it has taken off early supplies, some shops can't have special Wednesdays.
In a news report.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a criticist from Queensland University of Technology, says store fills supplies every night.
It stresses that the toilet tubes are large stuff so that the amount of supplies are low and, if it's done, make many spaces in the racks so that the pieces are getting less.
Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if there's a lot of stuff in the shelf, if the product is like a toilet tube and the disbelit could be in large numbers, the anxiety may be recommended, the vessel Russel Zimmerman through the ABC News office.
The produces of the toilet tibes resuming Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of supply.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and the Paper Solaris, which makes Sorbent, stress them working 24/7 to keep supplying, according to the news.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estat site, reported that some property sales offer free toilet tubes to the first lelang cure in Melbourne, when a little bit of a lelang was held because the buyer took the jeda for the long weekend of Buruh.
Wes NT News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, include eight pages of the intersection meant to cut and be used as a toilet tube.
The Toko-toko just refused to apply the limits, according to the report ABC Australia on March 3th, they said that they didn't plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that another product is also in high requests, including masks, treatments, dry foods, handwaves, and flour.
As soon as it was outside Australia, in the afternoon of the British Lanado’s indifference, the Danres’s toilet buyer to the two of them are rolling 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemi
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) states the COVD-19 outbreak that's going on -- the disease by the SARS-CoV-2 coup.
Although the word "pandemi" is only linked to how much disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO records the need to push the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemi trip.
If the country is detecting, testing, cleansing, and posting its people as responses, the works of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director of the General WHO.
We are very well aware of the level of the penyebaran and frivolousness, and because of the fearfulness level of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Control Center and Prevention of the United States U.S. U.A., this pandmi "belum ever happened before."
He said, in the record that CNN is published in February, "in addition to influenza, there's no flucture channels that have ever been traced from its appearance to the global spread of global continuing."
Ghebreyesus says the same view, saying, "We've never seen a pandemi that was triggered by koronavirus."
It goes on, "and we've never seen a prediction that can be handled at the same time."
The new status of pandemi followed the decision that in January which stated this plague as a world’s magnificence.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the plague is going to worse."
Until Wes, Asciated Press reports there are at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, which cause more than 4.600 death.
Pandemi coronavirus 2019-2020 is a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) which is continuing and because of the coronaviruse syndrome 2 heavy (SARS-CoV-2).
The Wabah was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, on December 2019, was noted as a World’s Health Health on January 30, 2020, and was specified as a pandemi on March 11, 2020.
Until 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and the history of history, which has led to about 97000 death.
Some 36000 people have been cured.
The fatal number of cases estimated 4% in Tiongkok, while all around the world starts from 13,04% to 0,08% in New Cellandia.
Generaljala covers fevers, rocks, and breaths.
Complications can cover pneumonia and enumonia syndrome.
The time has been exposed to the generals of symptoms about five days, but it can start from two to twelve days.
There's no known vaccine or a specific drug.
The primary treatment is a simptomatic therapy and suportif. The preventive actions that are recommended to cover the wash, close the mouth when the rock, keep the distance from other people, and monitoring and obligatory manuations for those expected infected.
Otorities around the world have been consulted by traveling limits, karantina, night hours, dangerous work, and facility cover.
This Pandemi has led to a heavy global economic disorder, delaying or religious, religious, religious, religious, and vast retribution that has led to panic purchases.
The schools and university have been closed well in the national and local level of 193 countries, which affects about 99,4 percent of students around the world.
The mission of this virus has spread from the ground and there are pharmacy incidents and discrimination to Tionghoa, people with the descendants of the East and Southeast Asia, and the people who come from the area with a significant virus case.
As the reduction of travels and heavy industry covers, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok, reports the pneumonia case claster by 31th December 2019 and the investigation was performed at the beginning of January 2020.
The case is most related to the Huanan Sea Food market market and because it's the virus expected to have the origin of the zoonotic.
The virus that causes a plague called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus found and debate with the bat coronavirus, the coronavirus of the round, and SARS-CoV.
Among the early case klasters reported on December 2019, two-per thirds are found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unpredicted report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be considered to the 17th November 2019, at the age of a 55 years of Hubei province, perhaps the first one.
There may be a large number of cases that are not reported, especially among people with a lighter symptoms.
Until February 26th, relative the case between young people, with 19-year-olds to form 2,4% cases all over the world.
The case is linked to the number of people who have been tested by CVID-19 and the results of the test have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Until March 23, there was no country to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with light symptoms, such as Italian, Dutch, Spanish, and Swiss.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, through January 23, 86% of CVID-19's infections were not detected, and that this infection that this is not documented is the source of infection for 79% of the documentation case.
A statistic analysis published on March 30 estimated that infection numbers in Italy are greater than the case reported.
The initial count of basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the United States’s Control and Prevention Center concluded that the number was likely 5,7.
Most of the CVID-19 sufferers are recovering.
For those who are not cured, the time since the symptoms of death between six and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97000 death is associated with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, to February 5th, about 80% of death happened to a man in over 60 years and 75% has a health disorder that has already gone, which covers the cardovaaskular and diabetes disease of official death due to the CIVD-19 pharmacy who gave a positive test to CVID according to official protocol.
The real fatal numbers of COVD-19 may be a far higher, since the official number may not include the person who died without being tested, for example, at home in the care house, dsb.
The parsial data of Italy found that the number of death advantages during the environment over the official COVID's death calculation with the 4-5 factor.
A woman talker for the U.S. Control and Prevention of the U.S. Center of Disease will admit, "We know [the number of deaths being spoken] is less than a real number", a statement that is strengthened by a non-miah report about the counts too low in the US.
The first death outside the island Tiongkok occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28th, outside the ground Tiongkok, more than the cellusin of death is recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italian.
To March 13th, more than forty countries and the torial areas have reported death, in every continent, except Antarctica, in general, some measurement is used to count the mortality.
These numbers have a vocabulary based on the area and the amount of time, and are influenced by the number of testing, the quality of health care, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as the age, the kind of anxiety, and the whole health.
According to the statistics Johns Hopkins University, death races against global cases are 6,0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number's vocabulary according to the area.
In Tiongkok, the death ratio estimate of a case down from 17,3% (for people with a 1-10 January 2020) is 0,7% (for a person with a synthesity of a synthesize after 1 February 2020). The other measurement involves case fatality (CFR), which reflects the percent of the diagnose of certain disease, and the fatal rate of infections (IFR), which reflects a percent of the victims of the victims and the disoginal disease.
This statistics are not bound to the time and follow a certain population begins from infection to the case resolution.
A number of academys have been trying to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based University of Oxford's Medicine calculated infection fatality for the entire environment between 0,1% and 0,39%.
The top top of this estimate is a way with the result of the first ac ac acact testing for CVID-19 in Germany and an statistic understanding that affects the impact of the baptism of CFR's estimate.
WHO confirms that this pandemi can be handled.
The top and the end of this plague is unrealistic and may be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University states: "Without control, the infection is often tapped and then it begins to fall down when the disease is out of the available inang.
However, it's barely possible to make any sense projection this time about when it's happening.
The senior medical adviser of Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan said that "the plague might end June" if the entire country can be promoted to follow the advice that I'm going to stop the virus.
In March 17th, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 would continue, perhaps to one or two years.
According to a Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical barriers and other steps will be required "to be available vaccines (perhaps 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of the University Vanderbilt states, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to ditransision, can disappear all of it" and this disease "will turn into season disease, which comes back every year."
Recursion virus will depend on groupicity and mutation level.
COVID-19's Gejala can be considered irrespective and infected without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fevers (88%) and dry rocks (68%).
The lack of lack of self - control coverage, the production of clots of clauses (flegma), is missing the breath, the breath, the veins, the pain, the pain, the pain, the headaches, the pain, the pain, the hemtics, the hemtics, the diamtics, or the sianosis.
The U.S. Control Center of Disease and the U.S. Disposed emergency symptoms of breathing, the breasts are depressed or chests are settled, disapproves, dispersion of walking, and crampsion on faces and lips; the attention of the medical is soon set up.
Some infected may be an asimtomatically, but with a test that confirms infections, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are contacted with infected people should be neutral and checked to make sure that they are not infected.
Tionghoa's people calculated asimtomatic races from some to 44%.
The encryption period (at between infection and symptoms) usually corresponds between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the number of CVID-19 that loses the beginning of 30% kissing powers, then down to 15%.
The details of the way that this disease is spread still intel.
The COVID-19 is believed to happen at the close contact time and through a small droplet produced when the collaboration, scanning, or speaking; close contact is a contact within the distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that unconnected rock can cause some 45 meters (15 feet) to 82 feet (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be highlighted by a small droplet which survives longer in air and produced when talking. Droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although these common viruss are not spoken through air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or the nose of the person that's close to it or may fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubtion and lung heart resusives, can make the pernapas aerosol into aerosol and then spread through the air.
The Service can also happen when someone touches the surface, including skin, and touched the eyes, noses, and mouth.
Though there is anxiety that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be low.
The Tiongkok government intersects the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fekal-oral. Virus's most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms look and on more disease.
People give positive tests to three days before symptoms, which determines the transmission may occur before there is a significant symptoms.
Just a few reports of the asimtomatic case confirmed by laboratorium, but an asimtomatic expression has been identified by some countries when contacting research.
The European Disease Control and Control (ECC) states that although it is not fully as easy as this disease is spread, one common person is invested in two to three other people, this virus can survive in the surface for hours.
Especially found that the virus can be detected to three days on plastic, and the steel of 304, one day on cardus, and more than four hours on copper.
But this thing depends on the balance and temperature, the pet and other animals have been tested positive CVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread a virus to humans, even though English authorities suggest to wash hands after contact with animals, like after contact with surfaces that may have touched people who are infected.
The quantal artifact syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, the first period of three pneumonia sufferers related to the quant disease disease of Wuhan.
All of the SARS-CoV-2 virus features are just related to the coronavirus in the universe, the virus can be destroyed if it hits the stairs soaps, which connects the protective amplop.
Virus is expected to have the origin of the zoonotic.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is geneticized with the Gene Betacoronavirus genus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (fird B) together with two ounces of bat.
This virus has a commonity 96% on the entire genome level with another bat chronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researcher Tionghoa discovered that there's only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome between a dozen virus and human virus.
Until now, the whole genome found at least 92% genetic materials between the coronaviruss and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tenggiling is SARS-CoV-2's intersect.
Influentials by virus can be diagnosed with a temporary symptoms, but confirmation is eventually done through the transcryption polygonal reaction (rRT-PCR) at a infected piece or embarking the CT.
A study compared between PCR to CT in Wuhan shows that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a number of overlapping features that are overlapd with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radology recommendable "CT can't be used for filters or as the first lini test in CVID-19. "
WHO has published some RNA testing protocol for SARS-CoV-2, which is first distributed on January 17th.
Testing using a transcryption polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a rescuing sample or blood.
The general results are available in a few hours till a few days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasof filter, but the throats can also be used. A number of laboratoriums and companies are developing an antibodial test.
Per April 2020, not one of these serology tests proved to be quite accurate to be approved for the use.
In the U.S., the specological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, just by the laboratorium identified.
The personality of the radiography and the tomography is computed (CT) on people who are symtomatically involved asymist glass-level opasity asimetry and there is no pleura efusi.
Italian Radological Society is working on an international database for an image interview on a confirmed case.
Because the intersects with other infections like adenovirus, unconfirmation of PCR has limited space in identifying CIVID-19.
A big research in Tiongkok compared the result of CT's chests with PCR and shows that despite less specific for infections, faster and more sensitive so sensitive to be considered as a filter tool in the epidemi region.
The neural network of artificial intelligence has been developed to detect the system’s acceleration feature with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disease would include keeping good personal cleannesss, wash hands, avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouths before washing hands, and use tastings on ceiling or slots and immediately dumping them into the trash.
The person who may have been infected is recommended to wear a surgeon's mask in the public.
The laws of various areas have been blocked to stop or scand to stop all non-existenial travels to and from the country and the areas that have been affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of the global scales in most of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of the community don't know where or how they're infected, the health treatment treatment that can be infected to do standard prevention actions, contact control actions, and eyeguards.
The use of the location data by the government for this purpose has triggered private problems, by exiting the statement from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations that call out the surveylans's kind of thing.
Some of the celluler apps have been implemented or approved to be used willingly, and on April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts working private friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the approach of the user to another cell phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are near someone who tests positive to CVID-19. It's wrong about how to prevent infections; for example, feed the nose and burns with unprotected drugs.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to develop it.
Sanctifying hands are encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash hands with soaps and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after resuming noses, rocks, or slings.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus was killed by the household soap that damages its shields.
Moreover, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hands with a little alcohol content of 60% of volumes when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, noses, or mouths before washing hands.
Surface can be accessed using a number of late (in minutes of display is infectant for stabult surfaces), including streanopropanol 621%, isopropanol 50–100%, hyoklorit natrium 0,1%, hydroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2,5%.
Other Lautans, like chloridas and chlorecesdin glunats, less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a unexpected COVID case or confirmed in the public facility, such as the office or the place of the child, all areas such as the office, the bathroom, the public area, the electronic equipment together like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and the ATM machine used by the sufferer, should be diagnosed.
Health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with their syneces or use tasys when rock or skeletons, and then quickly remove the tisu.
The operating masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because they use the masks can limit the volume and the spaces of expiratorary droplets that are spread when they speak, squeals, and rocks.
WHO has brought out instructions about time and style of masker.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virology expert at University of Leeds, "Disable the masker's tendency to touch the face with an unconditional hand, which is also the primary source of use for someone who takes care of this disease.
WHO recommends the use of the masker by a healthy person only if they are high risky, as the person who treats the CVD-19, although the WHO also recognizes that using the masks can help prevent people to touch their face.
Some countries have begun to push the use of maskers to the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of nonmedis face masks made of cloths. The crypt specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used to a healthy society, especially when near (1 meter (3 m) or less) people.
Hong Kong recommends the use of the operating mask when using a public transport or living in a crowd.
Thailand’s health office encourages people to make a monetary mask in the house and wash it every day.
Ceko and Slovakia Republic forbids people to go out to public without wearing masks or cover their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all his citizens to wear their face masks when going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the toserba to wear face masks.
Israel asked all his citizens to wear face masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since March, oblivious train passengers and buss wearing face masks per April.
Panama requires the use of the face masker every time out of the house, and recommends the creation of a artificial face for those who cannot buy face masks.
The face masker is also used largely in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
social limiting (which is called physical bounds) is an act of infection operation that is intended to slow down the disease by minimizing contact near individuals.
The social barriers include karantina; the limit of travel; and the closing of school, the work, stadion, the theater, or the cost center.
People can apply social barrier methods by living at home, limiting travels, avoid public areas, use greeting without contact, and keeping the physical distance of others.
At this time, many governments are mandated or scanning social barriers in a region that has a plague.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. government bodies and healthal organizations are quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (if there is no CVID-19 in a region) to be 50 people, and then become 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, German forbids meetings in the public area that involve more than two people.
The use of the term " social boundaries" has effect that people should completely separate themselves and not force people to remain associated with others through alternative ways.
This recommendations include the encouragement to have sex only with people living with you and not have virus or virus symptoms.
Isolation of mandiri at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed in CVID-19 and expected to be infected.
The health members have taken out detailed instructions for the correct self-religionment, many governments are required or recommendation of the quantine for the entire population that lives in the land that's built.
The most strict manantina engineers are released to people who are including high risks.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people recently traveled to countries or areas with the vast CVID-19 penyebaran was suggested to do the carantina stand for 14 days since the last view may have been possible.
The strategy in the plague's operation is an impairment or a driver, as well as a mitle.
The treatment was done at the early stage of the outbreak and was intended to track and dissolve the person who was infected and did other steps for infections and vaccines intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it's no longer possible to block the disease, further efforts move to mitle stages: these steps are taken to slow down the penyebaran and reduce its impact on health care and public treatment systems.
Investigating and mitle actions can be done at the same time.
Supresi requires more extreme steps to retremize the environment by reduceing basic reproduction to less than 1.
It lowers the risk of control on health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Intervenations of non-ndirectation to handle the plague of the individuals's prevention, such as handwashing, wearing face masks, and karantines; step-ups of the community, such as closing the school and cancel the mass meetings; the public connections to motivate these kinds of intervenation and the intervenation in this environment; and other steps in the environments, such as the surfaces that are intended to be performed in the enclosures, as the most real plague and the way of the city's range.
Other countries also apply various steps that are intended to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced massal filters and local carantinas, and gave warning about infected people's movements.
Singapore gave a financial support for infected people who did a self-interest carantina and wore a large fine for those who failed to do it.
Taiwan increased the production of face maskers and punishing medical supplies for England and the United States indicate that mitigasi (slowing, but not stopping the spread of epidemis) and supresi (verting the epidemi growth) has a major challenge.
Optimization policy can reduce the peaks of health care to 2/3 and death to one, but it still causes hundreds of thousands of death and the health systems.
Supresi is chosen, but it needs to be held as long as the virus is still in human population (or until the first vaccine is available), because if this is the first one is accomplished, the expression will quickly shift back when the driver's steps are recommended.
Long-term intervals to press the pandemy with the impact of social and economic.
There's not yet a specific drug that is approved for CVID-19, but the development efforts are being performed, which includes a certain drug test.
Assuming free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and break can help lighten the symptoms.
Depends on the level of the cold, oxygen therapy, intravena fluids, and the exercise support may be needed.
The use of steroid can cause patient conditions.
Some of the rest that was previously approved for other virus disease treatments are being located to be used in efficient CVID-19.
WHO also stated that some traditional and home treatments can ease the symptoms because of SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adapting health services for COVID-19 patient needs is a basic step in the plague responsion.
ECC and European regional WHO's office have issued guidance for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources in various levels, including focusing on laboratory service for CIVD-19, if allowing to cancel the electronation procedures, dividing and investing positive patients of CVID-19, and enhance the ability of intensive treatment by training the individualels and raising the number of sleep.
There's various theory about the first case.

A laboratorium test for a 2019 coronavirus perspective disease (COVD-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus viruss include methods that detects the existence of the virus and that detects the antibodians as response to infection.
There's a virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This test is used to confirm new infections or still active.
Antibodi (serology) detects can be used for diagnosis and population surveyions.
Antibodi tests indicate the number of people who are already infected, including people whose symptoms are too light to report or who have no symptoms.
The population’s accurate disease and the immuneity of groups in population can be determined from this test result.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, there's no country with data andal about virus areas in its population.
Until March 23th, there are no countries to test more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of countries that have been done.
This variation may also affect the fatality of the case, which is likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using the actual-time transcryption polimerase reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on a sample of the prediction obtained by various methods, including nasof filters or sample sputum.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours till two days.
Test RT-PCR done on the throats can only be held in the first week of disease.
The virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to form in the lung.
As an alternative, for the infected person in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the breath channel by using the strand cateter or the material produced through the ceil (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests developed in Chari Tamwan, Berlin, in January 2020 uses a transcryption polymerase reactions of real-time (rRT-PCR), and form at least 250.000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United States also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Koreaships of Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2 disperse of PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that has all my coronaviruse, and the RdRp genes for SARS-CoV-2. In Tiongkok, BGI Group is one of the first company who accepts emergency use of the PARS-CoVS-Disting National Plants for PARS. In the United States, the United States, the United States Department and the Department of PDRRRRRPinctors (UPVV-S2 CR) is a new 5-RRRPDPNU.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version tool gives no convincing results of reagen error, and the number of testing in CDC at the restricted Atlanta; this results in less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components are considered unreliable to February 28, 2020, and then it's a state laboratorium and local laboratory are allowed to perform testing.
This test is set by the U.S. Manufacture and U.S. Activation of the U.S.A.'s U.T.A.'s U.A.A. is starting to test at March 2020.
For 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possible testion of CVID-19 based RT-PCR on national scales.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a CVID-19 test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit was announced; grouping and execution must be done according to the CDC terms.
In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the Virology State Center and Biotechnology V centuries.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveilans in Health Controls, on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported a test to detect CVID-19's infection.
On March 19, 2020, FDA released an emergency usage (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had released the same authority to Hologyc, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
In March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from FDA for testing that would take about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved the testing that used the nucleat nucleat notermal acid technology that is not PCR.
Because it doesn't need a series of temperature displacement cycles, this method can give positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are about 12,000 machines in U.S. and Abbott is replacing for production to produce 500,000 tests per day. Tests use antibodi monoklonally tiing nukleokapsid proteins (protein N) new chronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope can give the result in 15 to 20 minutes like a quick influenza test.
A library review published on March 2020 concluded that "the toraks picture has a small diagnostic value at the beginning, during the meeting of CT [atomography computed] may have been there before a syruptional.
The special feature of CT includes a multilobar-glass-secret opasity with perifer distribution, asimetry, and postterior.
The subpleura domination, the crazy paving, and consoled is formed in the development of disease.
In Wuhan, a study that compares the PCR with CT in the current pandemi point shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, even though less specific, with many intercesssor features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
On March 2020, American College of Radology recommendable "CT can't be used for filters or as the first lini test in CVID-19. on March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for early filters.
A part of the implication of infection is antibodi form that includes IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals since about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity for disease, and in population surveys. The revision can be performed in central laboratorium (CLT) or with the point-of-care (PoCT) test.
The system is automated with a lot of clinic laboratorys will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, commonly used a specimen blood specimen, even if a series of spesimen can be used to follow the imun response.
For PoCT, usually used a blood specimen that was obtained through the skin tube.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not necessary before a checkup. On March 26, 2020, FDA mentioned 29 boards that provide notifications to agency as necessary and that is now able to promote their antibodi test.
On April 7, 2020, just a test that was approved by the FDA based on an emergency use otorization at March 2020, March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnosttics got a deal for their test device that can detect the antibodi IgG and IgA virus in blood samples.
His testing capasity to some hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than the convention of the convention of the virus RNA.
Antibodis usually detected 14 days after the infection, early April, U.S.A., found that none of the antibodi test was bought pretty good enough to use.
Hong Kong set up a scheme so that unexpected patients can stay at home, "departement of emergencys will give a spesimen tube to the patient," they send it back, and get the results of a few seconds later.
In March 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Health of the German Physicians said that the Germans had an capacity in about 12.000 a day of vein and 10.700 tests have been done in the previous week.
Biaya was held by health insurance if a doctor asked.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the entire capacity of over 1600,000 test per week.
On March 19, a time of condition was placed in several large cities.
For 26 March 2020, the number of tests done in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratorium survey reveals that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including the week 12/202020 and 33.491 sample (6,9%) tested for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and test the samples to test samples from 64 patients together, and then only further samples. In a positive combination of samples, in the 483dium is found. In 2000 m400 monavementals, "Mattas" is more than 2000 languages, "Matta, or more than 2000 languages.
With the construction of the BGI Wang Wang and eating 5 days, the modelanes indicate that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and related cost for carantina would be twice as much as if this testing capacity was not available.
Laboratorium Wuhan was soon followed by the lab of Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout Tiongkok.
By March 4, 2020, the total capacity of the day is 50.000 tests per day. The multiple-salar source of open sources of the Origami Ass can test assays as 1.222 patient samples to CVID-19 by using only 93 checks. This balanced desain can run in small laboratorium without need of robotic cair.
Until March, lack of and sufficient reagens have become slaves for mass testing in the European Union, England, and the United States.
Because of that, a number of researchers are trying to exploit the sample preplost protocols that involve sample warminges at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, Arab Emirat Union reported a much more coronavirus testing than any country, and is ready to increase the scale for the population.
It's accessed through the form test combination and the laboratory purchases of massal population from Grup 42 and BGI. (formed on the emergency detation lab "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
It was built in 14 days, this laboratorium was able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first laboratorium that had this scale outside Tiongkok.
Produces of testing that targeted various types of chronavirus genetic profiles developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts a German recipe for the production of test that was sent to the countries of low product without resources to develop itself.
German reference was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Control Center are not available to 28 January so that slowing down the possible test on the US.
Instead, experts say that the great use of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, most of the laboratory private sectors, built in a few years by South Korea government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called to increase the testing program as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 redemiment.
On March 2020, Tiongkok reported an amatural problem on their test device.
In the United States, a test device developed by the CDC has "cat," the government then removes the bureaucracy that prevents the trial by private, Spanish bought a test tool from the Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Bioechnology Co Ltd, but found that the result is not accurate.
The company explains that bad results may be the result of failure in collecting a sample or using a proper test device.
The Spanish Ministry says that they're going to pull the equipment that gives no truth, and replace it with other tests that Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% test device bought the Ceko Republic of Tiongkok has made it right.
The Prime Minister Matovi usually suggested that this test device was removed from the Danube River.
Testing, followed by positive-tested carantinas and tracking people who are contacted with positive SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end.
The study that works in the city of V congregation of Italy, the first location of death due to CVID-19 in Italy, made two rounds of testing at all populations that are over 3.400 people, with a distance about 10 days.
Some half of the positive people have no symptoms, and all the cases found inkarantina.
With the limit of the journey to this community, the new infections are nothing at all.
With a aggressive contact tracking, travel limiting in, testing, and karantina, coronavirus panding 2020 in Singapore developed a lot slower than other developed countries, even without extrem barriers, such as the displacement of restaurant and ritel company.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore suggested that the population stay at March 28th, but the schools are opened back in time after the vacation on March 23th.
Some other countries are also dealing with a aggressive contact tracking, deviating travels, testing, and karantina, but with a non-resentable karantina, such as Islandia and South Korea.
A statistic study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a lower fatality of cases, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have a light symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries do not have a testive capacity, and national laboratory with limited CIVD-19 experience, send five first CVD-19 positive samples and ten first negative samples to one of the 16 laboratorium references for confirmation.
From 16 reference laboratorium, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In this following task, the column "%s" is affected by the testing policy of the state.
The country that is just testing people who are hospitalized will have % positive results higher than the country that tests all the people, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factor.
Sancking hands, called in hand, is the act of cleaning someone's hands that aims to remove shit, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Closing hands with soap consistently in certain times of critical days preventing the spread of many diseases, such as diare and kolera, which is spoken through fecal-oral routes.
People can also be infected with physical disease, such as influenza or cellesma, if they do not wash hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
Five moments critical all day for washing hands with soap are: before and after a large drop of water, after cleaning a child's ass or changing a popoks, before eating and before and after preparing food or making meat, fish, or unggas raw.
If water and soaps are not available, the hands can be cleansed with ashes, the World Health Organization suggesting washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for the sick.
After changing the popok or cleaning a child that just used a toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughs, or sneered.
After touching animals, animals, or animal shit.
The medical handwash is curtailed to the cleaner that is related to medical procedures.
Closing hands before giving medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical goal of washing hands is to clear the hands of patogens (the virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause dangers or illness.
It is especially important for people who deal with food or work in medical fields, but it is also an important practition for the public.
Closing hands has a lot of health benefits, including the influenza spread, corona virus, and other infection disease; preventing the bad diares; reduce renapas infections;
And to reduce the baby’s mortality on the press at home.
The study that was done in 2013 shows that the prectical acceleration of washing hands can gradually increase the balita child’s high growth.
In developing countries, a child’s mortality number of disease and diares can be reduced by introduceing a simple behavior change, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the number of mortality from the disease to nearly 50%.
Intervenctions that encourage to wash the hands can reduce the case of dire to around its likega; this intervensi can be done by providing clean water in the lower construction area.
48% reduction of diare cases can be associated with cur soapse. washing hands with soapse is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diare and quant ritual infections (ISPA), as a subcondition behavior done in the house, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of one balita child's death; this disease causes death about 1,8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia caused death nearly 3,5 million children each year.
According to the UNICEF, make hands washing with soap before eating and after using the toilets to be the practice that can save more lives of vaccines or any medical actions, and reduce the death of almost half and death of the denominations of the denominator.
Cleaning hands are usually combined with other sanitation acts as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleanness (WASH).
Closing hands also protects themselves from the imperatives that are linked through physical contact directly.
A small side effects washed hands is the washing of hands that often be performed can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
The study that was done in 2012 in Denmark discovered that washing hands can cause the condition of gatal and cramps, known as the eximity of hand or hand hattis, most of them are among the health officers.
Closing hands too often is seen as one of the obsesif-compulsive disorders.
There are five moments critical during the day when washing their hands with soap is important to reduce the fecultual disease, which is, before and after using the toilet (misssing of small water), after cleaning a child's ass ass, before it cuts a child, before eating and before you prepare food or making food, fish, or unggas raw.
The other important time to apply the right handwash technique to prevent the infection was before and after caring for the wound; after having a pain, a trick, or blowing nose; after touching animal shit or dealing with animals; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, washing hands with soap still low.
A study about washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that the average 38,7% of the household preplances hands with soapse. A study in 2014 indicated that the Saudi Arabia has the highest level with 97 percent; the United States is near at the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the low level of the low level of the year with 23 percent. Now there are some changes in the behavior of the behavior to develop the behavior of this behavior in critical hands.
The fundamental Health Care program that applies to the Educational Department in the Philippines is an example of the right action to support the children’s health and education.
Ceases twice a year, plus by washing hands every day with soaps and tie their teeth every day with fluorida, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully applied in Indonesia.
microorganism cleaning from skin is strengthened with the addition of soap or deterjen to water.
The main soap and deterjeen work is to reduce barriers to late and increase the power of the late.
The water is just an unefisien cleaner because of fat and protein, which is an organic shit component, it's not easy to keep in the water.
That challenge, the fat cleaning and proteins were helped by a enough flow of water.
Sabun dense, because the nature that can be used back, may be able to contain the bacteria that were obtained from the previous use.
A small number of studis that examine bacteria transfers from the denominated soap concluded that the transfer could not have happened because bacteria arebilated with the busa.
However, the CDC continues to say, "The melt that has been released from the container without touching the hands more desired."
Sabun antibakeri was highly encouraged to a health aware society.
Until now, there's no evidence that the antieptic use or the disinfaction is better for an antibiotic organism.
However, an antibakteri soap contains a general analyd agent like a tricolosan, which has a list of vast strength-powered organisms.
So, even if the antibiotic forces are not targeted by antibakteri soaps, this soap may not be an spective.
In addition to the expiration of the cover and the material of the skin, the study of analytical acid, the adjacent acid, as a pH acid, a reflecter of the phosis, and a more active antimikrobat, the skin conditioner.
The warm water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bakteri grows faster at the temperature (37 °C).
The warm water is more effective than the cold water is covered in the removal of natural oil that holds shit and bacteria.
However, leaving behind with the belief of many people, scientific studies indicate that warm water use does not have the effect in reduce microbes in hand.
Hands or anticipation is a hygiene agent who doesn't have any water.
At the end of 1990s and the early 21th century, the hygiene agent of the alcohol - uncooked alcohol - glanding (as well as the monking of alcohol, antipic hands sculpic hands, or the culpritity) began to be identified.
Most of these hygient agents are based on an amopropile or ethanols that are organized together with materials like Carbomers (crilat acids) became gel or with gliserin like gliserin into liquid or busa to be used and to reduce the effect of debrilian effects of alcohol.
Plus hydroxide encer enhances further antimikroba activity.
A gosok alcohol syndicate kills bacteria, bacteria that hold against many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberkulosis bacteria, a number of viruss, herpes, rhinovirus, vacinius, influenza, and heptis.
The alcohol competitor that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99,97% (log reduction 3,5, is similar to the displacement 35 desibel) bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after use and 99,99% to 99,999% (log 4 to 5) bakteris in hand 1 minutes after the use of the edge of some effective bacteria and less effective virus.
The use of alcohol-based artifacts almost influentially against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of the gastreenity is spread. Anticreciative of alcohol in total amounts of enough use to cover or cover two hands.
The front and the back of two hands and in the ceiling and the end of all the fingers were rubbed about 30 seconds to light, basa, or dry gel.
The fingers also have to be washed well by clutching it at two hands, the U.S. Control and Prevention more recommending the hands of the sculpture, especially when the hands look dirty.
Recognizing the use of the service agent because of the ease of use and quick murder activity for microorganism; yet, the applicant agent should not be used as a substantial handwave, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based artifacts can often cause dry skins, unless the emolien and/or the skin pelembab is added to the formula.
The effects of drying from alcohol can be reduced or lost by adding gliserin and/or other emoliens to the formula.
In a clinical test, alcohol - leverage abuse that contains emoliens cause envy and coldness of skin is much lower than soap and antimikroba deterans.
In the alergic contact, contact urtikaria syndrome, or hipersensitivity against alcohol or aditional substance in alcohol’s absocracy is rare.
Lower deviation causes an instrument that interfered into the use of this product is compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Though effective, non-air agents don't clean hands from organic materials, but they're just checking it.
Because of this reason, the cleaner of the soap and water in preventing the spread of many patogens because the patogens are still on hand.
The free hand - registration of alcohol is very depending on its material and formulas, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol - rubber.
Recently, formulas that use chlorida clorida benzalkonium are proven to have a constant antimikroba activity after clothing, not like alcohol, which is evidenced after repeated use, perhaps the progressive side effects.
Many people in the low - product community are unable to buy soaps and use ashes or soil instead.
Abu or land may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the things that are worried about is, if terminated with microorganism, land or ashes may increase the spread of overweight disease.

Sabun raised a quarane from the skin, and the study shows that people tend to wash hands more carefully when using soap instead of using water.
Gosok at least for 20 seconds.
Buying a gese, which helps remove a quaman from the skin, and spooning longer off more germs.
Whens carefully underwater flow.
Takes in the buskom can make a hand calculated back.
Lie with dry laps or let's dry in the air.
It's a wet hand and a lembab that's easier to reconscuate, the most late area is jempol, the wrist, the area between the finger and the bottom of my nails.
It's a medic and my cupcakes that's forgotten can save microorganism.
Losion has often been recommended to keep the hands not dry; dry skin may cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.

The effective handing is an important part of the hygiene process, but there's a debate about the most effective form of handring in the public toilet.
The more research shows that a remote piece of paper is cleaner than the electric handwriting found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was performed by Westminster University, London, and was distributed by the industries of Europe Tissue Symposium paper, to compare the level of paper laps, warm airrings, and a more modern airring.
After washing and drying hands with warm airrings, the total number of bacteria was found growing up in 194% in the fingers and 254% in the handheld.
Earnating with jet airrings cause the total total total number of bacteria of 42% in the fingers and 15% in the handheld.
After washing and drying hands with paper laps, a total number of bacteria reduced to 76% in the fingers and 77% in handheld.Ilmuwan also perform testibility to determine potential contamination to other toilet users and toilet environments due to each sort of work.
Experts of jet air, which enlarged the air from units with the speed of 180 m/s (650 km/jam; 400 mph), capable of blowing microorganism from hand and unit and potentially tapping other toilet users and toilet environments up to two meters.
The use of warm airrings spread microorganism to 0,25 meters from the scout.
Paper device does not show a significant microorganism field. In 2005, in the study is performed by T asking for an und Umwelt, various methods of handring is distributed.
After the holder, the change of the number of following bacteria is observed:
There's a lot of menufacturing hands, and the scouts have been compared to the drying by using paper laps.
Sancking hands by using hand - phrase is an alternative for taking off if there's no soap and water.
The artifaction of alcohol has to be born at least 60% of alcohol.

After patient treatment, additioning antiseptic chemicals to soaps or "anmikroba" is working to kill hand washing materials.
The kill function may be wanted before doing a surgeon or in a situation when an antibiotic organism is very common. For 'gook' hands before the surgeon operations, needed to be disarized and disabled without touching, loruciting chlodin or yodium, laps to dry hands after washinging, and sterils to scoiling and other instrumsters to clean me down.

For staff's infection operation at the hospital, found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is from 20% of cleaning, and that additional benefits are very few when the cleaning frequency is lifted up above 35%.
Closing with soaps usually cause more than three times the cellular infections to food than to wash with antibaktery soaps. The intersect between scalings with alcohol disintegration and washing hands with an anticipation with the median times 30 seconds indicate that the artifacting has reduced more than 26% of the antiaptation.
However, soaps and water is more effective than alcohol-cookers to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the clostridium Clostium difficile from hand. Intervencile to improve the hygiene of health treatment in order to maintain the hands of the staff, increase the maintenance of the artifacted hands, and the collaps and the staff.
It takes more research to find out the most effective intervensi in various medical treatments.
In developing countries, washing hands with soaps were recognized as the basis of the cost to achieve good health and even good nutrisi.
However, a lack of water supply can be provided, soap, or a cleaning facility in residents, school, and work makes targets to reach a universal washing behavior as a challenge.
For example, in most of the lands of the countryside in Africa, the washing of the hands near the private toilet or the common toilet is rare, though available options to make cheap hands wash.
In any case, the lower of the hands washing level can also happen because of a habit that has been covered and not because of a lack of soap or water.
Push and encouragement washing hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of the hands wash, and result in a long - term population behavior change.

At that time, many people still believe that the infection was caused by the smell of rotten smell called miasma or the bad air.
In the 1980s, the outbreaks that were distributed through food and infections related to health care makes the United States’s Control and Prevention more actively motivated the hygiene as an important way to prevent infection.
The porous flu Wabah in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemi in 2020 increased awareness in many countries will be required to wash their hands with soap to protect themselves from the disease.
For example, the poster "cnick wash the right hand" was hung next to the wash of the hands in the public toilet and in the toilet of the building and the airport in Germany.

The risk operation of work for COVD-19
The danger control of the work to CVID-19 is a security metodology and health for danger control using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
A proper danger control at work is depending on work and job tasks, based on the risk of display, the level of disease in society, and the risk of each worker who may be rented by CVID-19.
According to the U.S. Security administration and Health of the U.H.A., the low display job has a minimum job contact with public and other employees; for this job, for this job, which includes hands, motivates the workers to stay in the house if sick, ethice care, and perform cleaning and practice routinely.
The risk of displaying work is being involved with works that need close contact or often with people who are unknown or expected to suffer the COVD-19, but it may be infected because of the interior society that's happening or international travels.
This group includes the workers who have contact with common society as in school, work environments with high population density, and high volume density.
Violence control for this group, besides basic infection steps, including the ventilation using high efficiency air filters, protection against art, and provide self - protection tools when meeting with CVID-19.
OSHA considers health energy and body rooms that are exposed to known or expected to suffer high - risking CVID-19, which is likely to be high - risking displays if the workers are doing an aerosol procedure on, or taking or handling the spesiment of, known people or expected to suffer in CVID-19.
A dangerous operation that is suitable for the workers include technique control, such as a negative ventilation space, and self-defination tool that fits the job's job.
The COVID-19 Wabah can have some effects at work.
Workers may not come to work because of the illness, need to take care of others, or because they are afraid of the possibility of displaying.
The trade Pola can change, either in the kind of things it is asked or how to get these items (like shopping outside the busy hours, through delivery, or scheduled).
In the end, the shipment from the geographic area that the COVID-19 may be disturbed. Kesiapsagaan and the streaking of infection disease will be used to drive the actions of protection.
Plans consider the risk rates related to various jobs and jobs, including display sources, riskal factors that arise from home and society, and the risk of each workers, such as old age or chronic medical condition.
Articles also indicate the necessary operation to overcome the risks and emergency plans for situations that may have occurred as a result of outbreak.
Poor pysiagaans and contagious disorder plans may be subjected to national or subnation.
The goal of the plague is to reduce the compatibility between staffs, to protect the people who are more risky for bad health support, to maintain business operations, and to minimize the bad effects of another entity in the supply chain.
The level of disease in the community of business is affected by the action of recursion taken.
Violence - control Hirarki is a lot of work frames used in security and health work to identify potential dangers based on the efficiency.
When COVID-19 can't be lost, the most effective operation is the technical operation, followed by administration, and the last of the protection tool.
The technical operation encompasses the employees from the danger of the job without depending on the behavior of the workers and can be the most cost solution to apply.
Administrative operation is a change in policy or procedures that require workers or workers action.
Self-protected protection tool is considered less effective than technical and administration operation, but can help prevent some of the display.
All types of APD should be selected according to the danger of the workers, installed as well as happening (the respirators, respirators), are consistent and correct, checked, replaced, and replaced accordingly, if needed, and released, cleaned, and stored properly or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Security administration and Health of the U.H.A., a low - display job has a minimum contact with public and other colleagues.
The steps of basic infections that are recommended for all jobs including washing hands properly, push workers to stay at home if pain, ethics ethics include tearing and displaced, prepares the work of a remote distance or turn to work in the future, if necessary, give the workers to don't know how to use things and the equipment, and do the routine.
The quick and awareness of individuals who are potentially infected is a vital step in protecting workers, clients, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Control and Prevention centers of the U.C.S. disease so that the employees who have a quantal disease disease have to live in the house until they are free of fever, the signs, and the other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using the treatment treatment or other symptoms, and so that the policy of the sufferment policy can allow the family to be treated, and the employees who are aware of this.
According to OSHA, the risk of display is being included a job that takes close contact or often in six feet (1,8 m) with a person who is unknown or expected to suffer from CARS-CoV-2, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a conversation around business location, or because someone just made an international trip to the location of COVV-19.
This group includes workers who have contact with generals, such as at school, work environment with high population density, and high - gritels. The techniques for these groups and high - risking groups include installing high efisional filters, increase the ventilation rates, installing physical barriers, and installing physical barriers such as the drivers, and installing windows of drivers to interestions for the services and business workers, which are in order to move the home to change their jobs, to help in the development and to the autoD, in order to the autoD, in which the coalitions, may have to raise the projectal work, to the artwork, or to help in some of the artwork, to use, to help with the artifies that are needed to get more physically, and to use, to the artworkworkworkworkworkworkwork, and to help in which are needed with the artwork, and to raise, and to raise, to help in which are needed with the artwork, to the artwork, and to the least the least the least the art-recurr, and to raise, and to raise, and to the artwork, and to be at least, and to the artworkworkworkwork work, and to be at least, and to help in order to be at least, and to be at least, and to raise, and to be at least, and to be at least, and to the least, and to be at least, and to be at least, to help with the least, to help with the least, at least, and to be at least, and to help with the least, and to help with the least to help with the least, and to help with the least, and to help with the least, at least for the least, and to help in the least, to use the least, and to be at least, at least to help with the least, to be at least, at least, and to help with the least, to use the art in a while others with the least to help with the artwork in the art of the least to help with the least to help with the least to use with the least, in the art of the art of the art of the least in the least, to help with the ability, in the art of the art of the art of the art, and to help with the least, and to get to get from the least, and to raise, in the least, and to use with the least, and to be at least, and to get from the least, to help with the least, in which, and to take, to be at least, to be at least when working with the art, and to work, to get from the art, to be at least, to help with the art, to help with the art, and to help.
Workers in this risk group don't need any respirators.
If someone gets sick on a plane, the right control of protecting workers and other passengers include displacementing people from six feet away, pointing you a cabin to care for a sick person, and offering a face mask for a sick person or asking him to shut up his mouth and nose with tas when the rock or skelete.
You'll have to wear a medical glove once when caring for a sick passengers or touch a body fluid or a surface that's potentially calculated and maybe another guardian device if a sick passenger has a fever, a rock continues, or trouble breathing.
The rest of your hands and other things should be removed in a lifeous pocket, and the surface that must be cleansed and diagnosed after it, including the intersects and other passengers, the risk control of delaying the journey if it is sick, and informing the medical center on the ship immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms on the ship.
The idea is, further medical treatments are performed in the company of people who are infected in the community, for school and child development facility, CDC recommends short-term covers to clean or discinct if people were infected in the school building ever.
If there's a conversation in the community at a minimum level to the current, a social deviation strategy can be applied, which includes: cancelting field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound-up class, or eating at the café, increase the distance between the table, the time of the arrival and the return of the meeting, and using a separate health location for the children to be like the flu.
If there's a high-line conversation in local society, in addition to social deliberation strategies, extending the school covers can be considered. For law enforcement officers that perform daily routine activities, the risk of health at once considered low by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to make contact with people confirmed or expected CVID-19 is recommended to follow the same direction as emergency medical technician, including using proper protection tools.
If a close contact occurs during the arrest, the workers must clean up and disinse the belt and task equipment before being used back using a semprotant or lap the household cleaner and follow standard operating procedures to control and remove the former APD and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers health energy and certain morgues to be at a risk of high view or very high.
The risk of high displays including health care, support, laboratorium, and medical transport energy that is exposed to patients known or expected by CVID-19.
This job is a high risk of displaying if the workers do an aerosol produce procedures on, or taking or handling the experiments from, a patient known or expected CVID-19.
Aerosol’s produce procedures cover the intubation, the collency procedures, bronkoscopei, some procedures and teeth checks, or invasive spesiment.
The job of the body rooms risked a high view covering the workers involved in preparing the body of known people or expected the case of COVID-19 in death; this job would be risking the displays if the workers were doing autopsy. Additional techniques to this group include the awareness of the unknown or expected CVID-19 patients, including when the aorosal process was executed.
Specially negative pressure Ventilation may be appropriate in some health carets and morgues.
The specimen must be handled with the risk of the Biological Security level 3.
The World Health Organization recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on the case of COVD-19. And in addition to the other ASHA recommendators to people who work in 6 feet of a patient known or expected to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and people who are doing arosiator procedure.
In the United States, the NIOSH filter cover respirator, the N95 - filter respirator, or better to be used in the context of the wording program and comprehensives that include compatibilities, training, and medical checks.
The other kind of respirators can provide a greater protection and increase the labor of the workers.
WHO just recommends the operating mask for screening officers on the incoming point.
For the person who took the researchian specimen, treating, or transporting CVID-19 patients without aerosol produce procedure, WHO recommends a surgeon mask, a shield glasses, or face shield, coat, and hand sarung.
If the aerosol produce procedure is done, a surgeon is replaced by N95's respirator or FFP2.
Since the supply of the APD is not enough all over the world, WHO recommends the needs of APD through a remote doll service, physical barriers like a window view, with only people involved in immediate care can enter the room with CVID-19 patients, using only APD's needs for a specific task, continue using the same respirator without taking care of patients without taking care of a lot of diags, and monitoring the U.P.P.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Preventing the weight and preparing the future
TANGGAL/WOMAN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No safe rights
We found ourselves in this incredible situation this month.
Epidemi CVID-19 is the thing that makes the human struggle clear and the responsibilities we have each other.
We've never experienced any challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, the same work, and global community development, which is the heart of the organization.
The friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all fellow workers through emails, calls, and communications are great human beings, which we're lucky enough to work with them.
My gratitude and pride can not be limited to mention you as a colleague.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means for the world today to access Wikipedia and how much this is a powerful symbol of this important resources to remain available for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you keep this site running, help pay for our partner, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is an moment when it's not just the work we do, but the way we do it, it's going to make an effect that means for the world.
Because the importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some important adjustments about how we work together, which will start next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and the next month.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the activities of the organization during this time.
We really want to get rid of pressure and support our mission for long-term.
If you need to reduce the job schedule, it's okay.
For all staffs, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set off a day, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world can't predict right now, and you don't know you need to take care of the lover, shopping trees, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should not be necessary to say this, but we did.
Cuti ill or PTO is not required, enough to tell your manager and help your team affect calendar and schedule to make sure the main work field can be solved.
( If you're diagnosed positively suffering COVID-19, hope to tell BryanC Ops to help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention of the management).
The rest of his reward will be paid in full.
We've said it again, to honor our commitment to the contractor's colleagues and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid by their work hours when it's normal.
It's including if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to channel stress toward the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in these times.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know the things we need to be concerned and can take the appropriate action.
Some job is considered esensial.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, Trust & Security, and the Dana Recognation team, between others, doing important work that might need additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to judge for the current purpose and move our focus to support things that are esensial for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most esensial project.
Too late now it won't be anything for the future.
We're not planning on "working the cowr's gone behind" after it's gone.
You won't be expected to work a cowr to fill an unrealistic time.
We realized that situation changed and would be trying to set targets and new time lines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to new reality and execution of daily work hours, we mean to adjust the time line for the 2020 2020-2021 plan.
We mean to review the long - term of the plan 2019-2020 which allows more time to make budget so the employees can have a very important job, self - care, and the loving care of the people as they need or want to work with a little schedule for the next few weeks.
The length of time line is very low on work and the stress of planning now in all the organizations.
We'll send our proposal to the next week Hall and we'll update the embassy and the team on the next move as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, display, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners in SF might have been exposed to CVID-19's virus.
However, because we're so worried, we hired the cleanup crew to detect all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They're using a hospital-grading liquid to detect every surface, lobi, and all the elevators access our floor.
The building uses his own security protocol using a product that supports the safety security.
We feel happy that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members in DC.
From last week, our DC's office had moved to a full-security station, a way with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As known by some of our partners in NYC, we're also considering renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still continuing, but it's probably going to happen.
Some of our partners work away for the first time.
We've been working a long distance to see that it might need adjustments and they want to provide advice to you:
At least one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Definisiately, make the agenda, and send the previous literature.
Make a video as default, with a tool such as Google Docs and Zoom to detect the collaboration and direct connections.
Show the leaders to adapt each meeting, someone to monitor chats for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting notes (or do a collaboration record).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well - beings to buy small food.
Combine with #remoties in Slack to talk to partners about the shared job
The SDM operation team is looking for a webinar-based ergonomi guide to support the expansion of the work distributed across the foundation.
This week we're asking for all community receptions to cancel the public view of Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until the WHO says the pandemi was over.
We told them that we understood our requests for the cancelation and other barriers could make them impossible to complete the activities set up and that no one would be given the penalty for having to postpone or modify the target.
The next week we will continue with additional guidance about Wikimania and other regional community community and themeity.
Generally, the centimen of the entire global community seems to be a sad result of this disorder, but at once relief for the explanation and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and the others.
To the front, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide room for community to monitor our effects and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special staff meeting.
We're going to use this time to share extra updates, answer your questions, and spend time to connect to each other.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue getting information from this email and all the esensial information associated with the other COVID-19 at the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information are in one place.
We're also trying to keep routine communication with staff living in countries that are currently affected by significantly.
If you have a question about traveling, events, primary work alurs, or trouble about liputans, or other things may need help, do not hesitate to tell and work together with CRT.
We're here to help give you support and become a securer in need.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judahn, Director of International SDM Operation.
There's nothing this change to be seen as our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, this change is a confession that, at this time, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we've never done before.
This change is the steps that we believe is important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue working, provide support that we need our movement, and give the world the service they're concerned about.
The job we planned was to be there waiting for us when the time came.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and maybe next few months.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work all the best when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzy angiotension 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outside cells (brant cell) in lungs, artifacts, heart, kidneys, and sous.
ACE2 has a very opposite activity with angiotension enzyme (ACE), with reduce the amount of angiotension-II and increase Angiotension (1-7), so it makes it a target that promises to treat cardiovaskular disease. ACE2 also works as a point into a cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often mentioned as hACE2.
An angiotensioner's angiotensioner is metaloenzier contained a sleeve that lies on the surface of the endotel cell and other cells.
ACE2 protein has a domain M2 peptidase terminal-N and an amino amino renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single-type puppet protein of I type, with active domains enzimicly rayed on cell surfaces in the lungs and other networks.
ACE2 extrasel domain separated from the transmembrant domain, known as the sheddase, and the flowed protein produced into the blood flow and eventually executed into the rin.
ACE2 is in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially in the cell cell alveolar lungs of II, small instrument, artotel cells and vena, and the artifact cells in most of the organs.
The mRNA ACE2 experiment also found in a serebral cortext, stiatum, hipotalamus, and the brain trunk.
ACE2's primary function is as a ACE competitor.
ACE breaks angiotension hormone I became angiotension II cupconsmetricsi.
Finally, ACE2 cut the amino amenilalanin terminal carboksil from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and manipulated it into angiotension (1-7) cupdilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tal-Tle-He-Pro-Pro).
ACE2 can also break some other peptidas include [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also set up a traffic transporter an amino netral SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembrant proteins, ACE2 works as the main entrance point into the cell for some koronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes CVID-19).
More specificly, the S1 protein binding on the spike or tonjolan SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 domain with ACE2 enzimatical domains on the surface of the cell causes endostosis and transmissions of the virus and enzymes into the endosom located in the cell.
The process in this virus also requires a protein priming S by the TMPRS2 protease series, which is currently investigated as potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesis that increase the ACE2 rate in the cell might help against infection.
However, many professional societys and body regulates recommending the continued inhibitor ACE and standard ARB therapy.
A systematitude and metaanalisis, which is published on July 11, 2012, found that "Very inhibitor ACE user causes a signifiate 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Moreover, "ACE inhibitor user also lowered the risk of pneumonia on patients that have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially a stroke patient and a heart failure.
ACE inhibitor use is also associated with the increase of humanity related to pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of the entire pneumonia. "
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for the lung injury, and it seems to increase the lung hemodinamik and the oxygen of the pig's veination with the accountic breath of the lipoplisakarida.
The time of the rhACE2 part on humans is about 10 hours with a series of 30 minutes instead of the length of the effects (duration) 24 hours.
Some interviews indicate that rhACE2 may be a drug that promises patients with intreats against the renibitor-inhibitiotension system, classic or in a disease with angiotension II in the increasing blood sire.
b'Application CVID-19 is a celluler software application designed to help track contact to win the current environment 2019-2020, which is the process identifying people ("kontak") which may have been connected with the infected people.
Many applications are developed or approved, who have the official support of the government in some areas and the yurisdiction.
Some jobs frames to build contact tracking applications have been expanded.
The privacy problem is questionable, especially related to the system based on the application's geographic location.
Unrecognised Alternatives include Bluetooth signal use to record the approach of the user with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would have promoted the functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android's operation system and iOS.
In Tiongkok, the Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has spread an application that allows the people to check if they have contact with COVID-19.
This application is used in more than 200 cities of Tiongkok. In Singapore, the application is used by TraceTogether.
This application is developed by local TI community, released as open sources and will be passed to the government. The North Macedonias launch "StopKorona", a Bluetooth-based application to trace displays of potentially infected people and give immediate responses to health treatment authorities.
This application is developed by communication and Technology and Health Ministry.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking application is in an advanced development stage and will be available to spread in a few weeks. The same application was planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and Selandia are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. The Russian means to introduce geofencing applications for CVID-19's CVID patients that live in Moskow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may have happened to an application-based system, which includes false positives and may be limited effects if the data taken is limited to some of the population.
To overcome anxiety about the field of the "coronavirus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets the boundaries on the type of organization that can add the associated application to App Store, which is limited only for the organization of "resmi" or who has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon are using similar bounds.
The privacy supporters express their concern about the application of mass surveying using koronavirus applications, especially about what infrastructure surveys are made to handle coronavirus's environmental environmentals will be stopped after the threat is passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations bring a statement that invites the limits to this kind of survey.
This organization states eight conditions on the government project:
The survey has to be "ascient the law, necessary, and proporality"
The need for monitoring and surveylans must have a sunset klausa;
use of data must be limited for COVD-19's purposes;
Security and animation of data should be protected and proved to be protected by evidence;
digital surveys should avoid getting worse discrimination and marginalization;
every piece of data with the third party must be defined in law;
There must be protection against abuse and the rights of the citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all the "furnative interest" that includes public health experts and terminalization groups. Chaos Komputer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Tanpa Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzenz) (RSF) also issued a check list.
Google/Apple plan to be discussed means to cope with the surveylans problem constantly by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operation system after no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based locations, and not applications, so remove the needs to download applications and ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was set up.
The network solution that has access to raw location data has potentially significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; some system that protects privacy has been created and use a central server only for interaction (see part below).
In South Korea, an unused application system used to perform contact tracking.
In addition to using special applications, system collecting information from various sources, including celluler device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined this information to produce notifications through text messages to the infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contact, the government also makes the information available for the public, the only thing that is allowed to have a great change in information's private law after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to commonly over a number of applications and websites. Such countries are considered to use the system own and the system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details are not fully released.
The contact that protects privacy is a maped concept, with a large number of research literatures starting from at least in the last year. On April 7th of April 2020, more than the group is working a private solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLEgy), to record the approach with other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a cordination efforts that contain a touchable approach and desentralized protocol, and not a single protocol. The protocol is neutralized include the Applicated Privaration of the Territralization Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T) Number (CN, quoted Genesis Kontak, CEN, and Protocol Merivativeism for Privativeization (PT), and other Interestionary Distationalics, and other cells (Puler).
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never left the device, and all match occurred on the device.
The Privacy Group in the Lab Media MIT developed SafePaths, platforms to use the technique to protect privacy while collecting and using locations or databases to trace the CVID-19 penyebaran.
This is based on research from a white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintain Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020.Upaya similar is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, company that developed private technology and was also established in MIT Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe software technology to allow user to share the location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5th 2020, global TCN's TCN coalition was built by groups that owned the same approach and is a largely overlapping protocol, with the goal to reduce the partition and allow global interaction of tracking and warning apps, which is the main aspect to reach a vast reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by the official official application to be an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls the Android's celluler and iOS platforms, announces initiative to contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on Bluetooth Energy and chronography combinations that protect privacy.
They also published the core technology specification used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to launch in three stages:
tool launch to allow the government to make official tracking applications that protect privacy
Integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to cope with data and surveylans continue to disabling the system through operating system update, and then remove it the same way after the threat passed.
B'Reposion of medicines (as well as new purposes, new profiles, or new tasks on medicine or therapy distribution) is the use of drugs that have been approved for the purpose of the new treatment, which is for medical or medical condition.
This line is a scientific research line that is now being done to develop a safe and effective CVID-19 treatment.
Other research direction include COVD-19 vaccine development and the convalesen plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targeting drugs, each proteins have some ligan binding sites.
Analisis of those ligan binding sites can be the basis of the development of effective drug development to the protein CVID-19.

As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 candidates are in early stages, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and the other 37 is announced, but with a little public information available (i.e.e. on plans or being planned).
Test Fase I-II perform early security and imunogenisity tests, usually performed randomly, controlling lipbos, and in some locations, while it determines a greater effective dose.
Test Fase III usually involves more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effects to prevent disease, while monitoring the side effects on optimal dosis.

The posting of social media connector that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been identified earlier and that the vaccine has been available.
The Paten-patens quoted by various social media postings refer to the patent that are available for genetics and vaccines for other coronavirus tunes, such as SARrus coronavirus.
B'COVD-19's coronavirus's disease is a disease based on the concrete syndrome 2 weight (SARS-CoV-2).
Generaljala covers fevers, rocks, and breaths.
Another tech could include the pain, the muscles, diares, throat disease, loss of kissing, and stomach pain.
The time has been exposed to the generals of symptoms about five days, but it can start from two to twelve days.
Although most cases cause light symptoms, some are developing as virus pneumonia and failing organs.
Until 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and the tertorial areas, which cause more than 153,000 death.
More than 568.000 people have recovered.
Despite being produced during the breath, droplets usually fall down to the ground or to the surface and not to be contagious to distance.
People can also be infected by touching the surfaces that are contaminated and touched their eyes, noses, or mouths.
In the surface, this virus can last until 72 hours.
This virus is very contagious for the first three days after the news may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next disease level. The standard diagnosis is with a transcryption chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the nsof filter.
The use of maskers is recommended for people who are expected to be infected by the virus and the people who take care of it.
Recommendations about the use of masks by common society is different; some authorities recommend to avoid using masks, some recommending their use, and others need to use them.
Right now, there's no vaccine or specific treatment for CVID-19.
The locality of disease has been recorded in nearly six countries of WHO.
A person who infected a virus can be without symptoms or symptoms such as flues, such as fever, coughs, teasyness, and breaths.
Emergencys include a hard time breathing, hypothetic or crowded in a constant chest, confused, hard to wake up, and face or bias; medical treatments are soon recommended if these symptoms show up.
The top cementing, such as insects, ingusans, or throat pain can be found, but it is rare.
The gastrointestinals, like muals, puppling, and diare, died in a mixed range.
Some cases in Tiongkok were beginning with a concrete picture of his chests and celebrities.
In some places, illness can develop pneumonia, failing organs, and death.
It's called the time of inkubation.
The time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can start from two to 14 days.
97,5% people who work on are going to suffer symptoms in 11,5 days of infection.
This impostor in unrecognition is not fully known; yet, the early evidence indicates that they may contribute in the preaching of disease.
At this time, the infected proporsian who did not show the symptoms that were unknown and intelated, with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) reported that 20% of all cases remain confirmed without symptoms during the hospital.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in the case of his day on April 1; from 166 infection that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
The sputum and water liur can carry virus loads in large scales.
Speaking loudly releaseing more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered rock can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4,5 feet (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually notular through air, the American National Science Academy states that bioaerosol transmisi may have happened and the air - conditioned collision that is placed outside the doorroom produced a positive sample for the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubtion and lung heart resequency (RJP), can make the pernapas constraint turn into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Though there is a concern that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is believed to be low, the most contagious virus when people are crowded; even if the spread may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Disease Control and Control (ECC) says that although it is not fully as easy as this disease is spread, one common person is invested in two to three other people, this virus can survive in the surface for hours.
Especially found that the virus can be detected for one day on karton/kardus, to three days on plastic (polipropilen) and the rustic steel (AISI 304), and four hours on copper 99%.
However, this vocality depends on frequency and temperatures.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if it is used properly; the soap products illustrate virus protective layer, deactivate the virus, and release it from other skins and surfaces.
Other Lautans, like chlorida and chloricsedin glucinets, are less effective in a study in Hong Kong, the air sample was taken in the median two days after the inap treatment began.
On the five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus load on the second day test.
The quantal artifact syndrome Koronavius 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new quantary syndrome coronavirus, which is the first of three people to the pneumonia related to the quantal cases of the accountal disease of Wuhan.
All of the SARS-CoV-2 virus features are new to the current coronavirus.
Out of the human body, these viruss were killed by the stairs soaps that broke his shield's bubbles.
Paru is the most powerful organ by the CVID-19 because the virus accesss the inang cells through angiotension enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most abundant in the alveolar cell of II types.
This virus uses a special surface glikoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter inang cells.
Kun heart cedera found at 12% people infected in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in severe disease.
High cardiovaskular symptoms because of a systemic inflamation response and imunetic system disorder during the development of disease, but quant injury may also be related to the ACE2 prescriptors in the heart.
ACE2 committed very high in heart and involved in heart function.
The trombosis depth (31%) and rombobolism vena (25%) are found at COVID-19 infection patients in ICU and may be associated with a bad prognosis. Otopsian on the dead because CVID-19 found an alveolar damage infus (DAD) and inflamasi inflamated in the fosit.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicalme for a breathline epitel cell expressing ACE2, heavy COVD-19 patients have systemic hiperinflamation.
Specially, the GM-CSF ptogenic cells are proven to be associated with monositioning IL-6 inflexible inflation and lung patology on the CVID-19 patient.
The limfositic infiltrates have also been reported on the autopsy.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the response to the actual-time transcryption chain (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done in the account samples which are obtained through nasof filter smoke; but, samples of nasal or sputum can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours till two days.
The blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken by two weeks so that the result has a small amount of time.
Tiongkok scientists are able to collaborate this coronavirus's coronavirus and replicate the genetics so that laboratoriums throughout the world can develop the test of polymerase chain (PCR) independently to detect infections by this virus.
On April 4th 2020, antibodi test (that can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) is in development, but is not much used.
The Tiongkok experience with the testing shows the damage is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
The multilobar-glass opasity of multilobars with periphere distribution, rosemetris, and the postteriors are found at the beginning of infection.
The subpleural domination, the gila of the paving, the lobular alveolar with a vocabulary condition, and consoleidation can come up with the development of disease.
A little data is available about microscopic strokes and CVID-19 patofisionology.
The main patology meeting on the autopsy is:
Makroscope: pleury, pulmoner, pulmoner console, and edema
Four types of pneumonia viruss can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmoner edema, pneumosit, large atipis pneumosit, interstisional infiltracy with limfositic infiltration, and giant cell formatting are united in many
heavy pneumonia: an alveolar damage infus (DAD) with an exudat alveolar infus.
DAD is the cause of the accountt breath syndrome and heavy hipoksemia.
pneumonia in healing level: exudat order at alveolar and pulmoner interstisial fibrosis
Blood: intravaskular coagulation diseminata (DC); leukoeristroblatic reaction
The steps of prevention to reduce the possibility of keeping the infection in the house, avoid the most places, often washed hands with soaps and water at least for 20 seconds, practice good exercise higiene, and avoid touching eye, noses, or mouths with unsancred hands.
CDC recommends to close your mouth and nose with tas when coughs or scans and recommends the use of the section in my pocket if the paper is not available.
It's a good hand after a cough or something.
CDC recommends the use of the cover of the cover of the area in general, part to limit spaced by people without symptoms. The social partition is intended to reduce contact with many people, with the way to close the school and work, limit the trip, and cancel a largekalaal meeting in the public.
A limitation committee also includes people keeping the distance at least 6 feet or 1,8 meters.
There's no known drug that prevents CVID-19. Because the dissipated vaccine is not yet available until the beginning of 2021, the main part in dealing with CVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemi summit, which is known as "furva".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash hands with soaps and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after respiring noses, rocks, or slings.
More CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hands that contain at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In region where commercial hands are not available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In this formula, antimikroba activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
The condrogen peroxide is used to help remove the bacteria spora in alcohol; this substance is not active for the anticipation of the hand.
Gliserol added as a humcibility.
People are handled by supportive treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they carry a virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane (ECMO) has been used to handle credibility failures, but the benefits are still considered.
Self - cleanness and lifestyle and health - feeding patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Suportive treatment may be useful to people who have a light symptoms at the beginning of infection.
Intensive care experts and lungs in the United States have organized treatments from various institutions into free resources, which is IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical energy is more recommending the parasetamols than the momprofens to use the first lini.
Preditional actions must be taken to minimize the risk of the cellularity, especially in medical treatments when doing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health energy that treats COVID-19, CDC recommends to place the person in the Tular-Udara Dictionary Isllation Room instead of using standard preventing action, contact control actions, and paralar prevention actions. CDC parse the direction for use of self-defination (APD) during the environment.
The recommended equipment is: APD's garment, respirator or face mask, eyeguard, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not a face mask) is better.
The N95 destination was approved for industrial order, but FDA has been investigating this masker to be used by the Otorization of the Emergency Use (EUA).
Repirator N95 is designed to protect from air transport particles such as dust, but the effect of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use that are not mentioned in label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends to use the face cover or, as the last effort, the artificial mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too heavy that it takes medic ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are heavy.
The type of surgical support for people who have failed to breathe about COVD-19 is active for people who are treated in the roof, and there is evidence that intubtion can be avoided with high flow canal or biposiitive air pressure.
It's not known if one of these two methods produced the same benefits for critical sick people.
Some doctors prefer to use an invasive ventilation, when it's available, because this technique extends the penyebaran of an aerosol particle compared to high flow canal lenses.
Many developed countries don't have enough hospital beds per sufficient crabs, which limit the medical system’s capacity to handle the loval of a sudden amount of CVID-19 cases so that they need enough inap care.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% in the intensive care unit, 2,3% requires mekanical ventilation support, and 1,4% dead.
In Tiongkok, about 30% CVID-19's CVID, which was held in the ICU.
The mechanical Ventilation became more complicated with a quant breath syndrome. The COVID-19 and oxygen have become more difficult.
The Ventilator that can do pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to evaluate oxygen delivery and then minimize the risk of lung injury and pneumotoracts associated with ventilator.
High PEP may not be available on old ventilator.
The study of the treatment potential begins on January 2020 and some of the medications are in a clinic test.
Redesivir seems to be the most promised one.
Although the new drug develops may take some 2021 time, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other use or are already in further level tests.
The cure can be tried on people with a severe disease.
The volunteers who were recommended that WHO was involved and in the test of the efficiency and potential treatments.
The convalesen Plasma hasn't been working on a clinical study to prove the security and the efficiency for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched a celluler application to deal with this disease.
User requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'executive' using surveylans data so that it can detect infection risks.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potentially detected, the application is not just recommendating a self-recognizing carantina, but also tells local health experts. The engineering of the cell data, the recognition technology, the phone tracking, and artificial intelligence is used to track people of infected and people who are involved in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government allowed security to track the data of the person who expected the coronavirus.
The step is taken to do the karantina and protects people who may be contacted with infected citizens.
In addition, on March 2020, Ulsche Telekom shared phone data to the body of German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to examine and prevent virus penyebarans.
The Russians use facial identity technology to detect carantinas.
The Italian regional health comisioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told the phone operator that "40% people are still moving around."
The German government did hackathon weekend 48 hours with more than 42.000 participants.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solution against coronavirus’s preaching.
People may experience pressure from karantina, travel barriers, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
They were quoting Rory O'Connor who said, "Insolation of social, loneliness, health emergencies, stress, and economic corruption are perfect storms that endanger the mental health and welfare of people."
This disease can continue a little or no symptoms, which is similar to the physical breath disease of another public, such as pile.
A light case usually heals in two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for CVID-19 infections of data from a similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for CIVD-19 is still less.
In the most severest person, COVID-19 can quickly develop a quant breath syndrome which causes a respiratory failure, a skeleton synk, or failing organs.
The combinations associated with COVID-19 include a disability, abnormal blood abnormal, and damage to heart, kidneys, and hearts.
The rest of the blood displacement, especially the increase of protrombin time, is observed at 6% CVID-19 patients treatmentd in the roof, while the addition of the kidney function was seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% people with the COVID-19 picture show the increase of heart enzims.
According to the same report, median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the instrument.
However, patients that were transferred to ICU have median times seven days between the instrument and death.
In a study that examines the early cases, medians start from early symptoms until death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have a number of deaths 2,8%, while women have a number of deaths 1,7%.
Histopatology samples of postmortem indicate an alveolar damage with exudat fibromiksoid celluler in both lungs.
It's the change of the virus that's dead on the pneumosit.
The lung image looks like an int breath syndrome.
At 11,8% of death was reported by the Tiongkok National Health Commission, heart damage, with the increase of troponin or heart stop.
According to March months from the United States, 89% people who are treated have the instrumental conditions of medical and economic social resources that can also affect human races.
Humanity counts of different circumstances because of the difference of the region, but also because of the metodology trouble.
Less than a light case count can cause death numbers to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case that lasts in the past can mean a mortal figure at this time counts too low.
Smokers have a chance of 1,4 times more than a severe COVD-19 and about 2,4 times more likely need intensive treatment or die than that is not smoker.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% lung capacity to 30% on some who are recovering from disease, and lung scanning shows organ damage.
It can also cause treatment-intensive syndrome after recovering.
Until March 2020, it was not known that the infection had provided effective and long - term for people who were cured from this disease.
Imunity is considered possible to be obtained, if you see other coronavirus behavior, but has been reported in a case of COVD-19 that was followed by a positive coronavirus test of a few days after.
This case is believed in this is a bad waste infection, and it's not a renovation infection.
This virus is expected to be natural and comes from animals, through spread infections.
It was actually unknown, but over December 2019, the infection spread almost the whole of it was motivated by the expression of human beings.
A study of 41 cases confirming the first CVID-19, published on January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the early symptoms date was a December 2019.
official publications from WHO reported the beginning of the symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurement is used to count mortality.
This number has a vocabulary based on the area and the amount of time, and is influenced by the number of testing, health care quality, memory options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, kind of age, and health in general.
At the end of 2019, SICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infection that confirms the laboratorium and U07.2 for the death of CVID-19 who is diagnosed with clinciagnosis or epidemiology for the SARS-CoV-2 infection of S. Rasios.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, death races against global cases are 6,9% (153.822/240.191) per 17 April 2020.
The amount of vocalized by the area. Other measurement encompasses a fatal number of cases (CFR), which reflects the percent of the diagnose of a person who died of certain diseases, and the fatality of infections (IFR), which reflects the percent of the infected people.
This statistics are not bound to the time and follow a certain population begins from infection to the case resolution.
Although not all people infected make antibodis, the antibodis can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentrum of Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 people, 802,000%) is dead.
In Gangelt, this disease spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread among young people, causes a relative mortality, and may not all the death of CVID-19 was identified as the death of CVID-19.
In addition, the German health system has not been under control.
In the Netherlands, about 3% population may have an antibodi, as it was reviewed from the blood donor.
69 people (0,004% population) died of COVID-19.
The pandemi and the level of mortality is different for men and women.
Mortality is higher to men in the study done in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for a man is at the age of 50s, with a risk between men and women just didn't look at 90.
In Tiongkok, death numbers for a man of 2,8 percent and for a woman of 1,7 percent.
The reason must be for the difference based on this kind of matter is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be a reason.
The immunity of immunity based on a kind of immunity, a lower smoker to women, and a man who has a chomorbid condition, such as hyertension, at a younger age of women can contribute to higherity to men.
In Europe, 57% people infected are men and 72% people who died because COVID-19 was men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government does not track data related to a kind of passion for COVID-19 infection.
Research indicates that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The touch of a woman’s medical officer, especially a nurse, and they have a higher chance to trace the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for the crown, the VI for the virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak is identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is selected to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e. g. the species of the animal, or a group, by way with international recommendation for stigmatization. Virus that causes CVD-19 names to be called the heavy synthesis of 2 (SARS-V-2).
WHO also uses the COVID-19 virus and "the virus responsible for COVD-19" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruss are commonly called "Coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and this disease were commonly called "cononavirus" and "cononavirus Wuhan".
On January 2020, WHO recommends 2019-nCoV and the accounting disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for the virus and disease according to the 2015 guide that does not use the name of the location in the name of the disease and the virus.
The official name COVD-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is released on February 11, 2020.
Because the capacity limit in the standard supply chain, some digital producer prints health care materials such as nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when a Italian hospital needed a ventilator, and the founder could not give it in a time - needed scale, a local company of themyasa-back and print 100 diups that are necessary in the last night.
After the beginning of COVD-19's outbreak, the conspiration theory, wrong information, and disinformed about the origin, scales, plumbing, treatments, and other aspects of disease, which spread quickly from theng.
Humans seem to be able to spread a virus to some other animal.
Studis failed to find evidence of virus repplications on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There's no cure or vaccine approved to cure this disease.
international study of vaccines and COVID-19 is being performed by government organizations, academy groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization programd the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of four-six-sixed medications that have been with the most promises.
Vactionn is not available, but various institutions are currently active developing vaccine candidates.
The previous study of SARS-CoV used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 used the ACE2 recipe to enter the human cell.
There are three of these vegetable vaccine strategies.
First, researchers are meant to make a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either active or dead virus, is intended to quickly trigger human imuncibility against new CVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is intended to create a vaccine that makes the system sensitive to certain subunites on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research is focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus to enzy ACE2 prescriptors.
The third strategy is a nucleat acid vaccine. (Vaksin DNA or RNA, new technique to make vaccines).
The experimental Vaksin made with these strategys must be tested to find security and security on March 16, 2020, test the first clinis of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Arkansas.
Vactionn contains a dangerous genetic code that is copied from a virus that causes a disease. depending on-antibodi is recommended as potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2, but this method is still controversial.
There's more than 300 active clinic tests on April 2020.
Seven tests of efficient treatment that have been approved for malaria, include four studis against hydroxickuin or chlorokuin.
The one given purpose of a new goal forms most of Tiongkok research, with nine tests of Fase III on the brakes of thevir in some countries with the land - time landing at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dinamission of the medical development for a vaccine and CIVD-19 dollinal drugs are being distributed for CVID-19, which includes the brakes, chlorokusivir, and hidroxiolorklorkuin, lopinavir, and lopinavirinalvir and nin.
On March 2020, there's a temporary evidence for the brakes ofvir.
The clinicing was observed to patients that were treated with the brakesvir in emergency treatments.
Test Fase III is being done in U.S., Tiongkok, and Italy. Klorokuin, used to treat malaria, located in Tiongkok in February 2020, with early results.
Yet, there is a call for a review of the research.
Korean Health Authority and Tiongkok recommends the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Virology Virology Wuhan Institute, although recommending the daily dose of one gram, records that doses twice are very dangerous and can turn off.
On March 28, 2020, FDA released an emergency use for hydroxloclokuin and chlorokuin for doctor's policy that treats the CVID-19. The Coffman Tiongkok edition also include interferon, laptopvirin, or umifenovir to use against CVID-19.
The early data shows that the laptopvirin high dose is required to drag SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for studi in vivo more after showing SARS-CoV-2 captivity in low concentration. The development indicates that the early priming of tone protein protement of transmembranease 2 (TMPS2) is very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through the interaction of ACE2 prescription.
The study about chlorokuin and hydroksilorokuin with or without azimicsin has been preventing the medical community to use this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not operate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no role known in CIVD-19.
The satokin storm is possible to happen to CVID-19 heavy stages.
There's evidence that hydroksixlokuin may have the antistickin nature of the Tocilizumab has been included in treatment by the Tiongkok National Health Commission after a small research was completed.
This cure is being under 2 non-accetic phases at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with a severe disease.
Incombined with a serum feritin blood test to identify the storm of the hookin, this drug is meant to fight the satokin storm, which is expected to be the cause of death on some people who are affected.
In 2017 antagonis prescriptors interleukin-6 were approved by FDA based on retroptive cases study for erctive refractive steroid refractorse treatments that were produced by different causes, which is CAR T cells therapy.
Until now, there's no evidence of acact and control that the tocilizumab is a fine treatment for CRS.
Translators the refined antibodis and inserted by the system of people who have been cured from CVID-19 to people who need it is being promoted as the nonvaksin anti-ren implication method.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconscretional results.
The virus neutralization is a working mechanism expected for the anti-sif antibodi therapy that can present the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, like a celluler’s hypothesis that depends on antibodi and/or fagosis, too.
Other antiboditic therapy shapes, for example, using other monoconcolonal antibodis that are produced, are in development.
Convalesen serum production, which is a part of the liquid part of a patient’s blood that has been healed and has a specific antibodi on this virus, can increase for faster use.
Conronavius disease, a number of related syndromes
Linliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who was then infected and died because of CIVD-19 after the awareness will spread the virus.
