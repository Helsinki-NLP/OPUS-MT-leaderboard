28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last it went up with him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and the medical department in San Francisco announced.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations were in progress.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked as a cook in Boston, had married his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a small team working like a close family and we're going to miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Gallicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Gallicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something to prepare for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who was swimming with the electricity.
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's telephone number 415-575-444444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that clear in an interview.
"I am always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to be always perfect and successful."
"Truly, these things are better for me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "miss perfect" as explained in the current Cosmopolitan.
The actress likes to spend her time at home, making TVs with loose dutts and Mexican food, it's in the magazine.
"We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," the Hollywood star says.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from 25 August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-olds.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evenings, they hunted home in the fast gallop to the feeding troughs.
One kilometer at this pace, I'm scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV's plant, and he didn't even push himself on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
National Merit Cross, Silver Lorberblatt, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already nodded him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he passed on the price money of 25,000 euros in the same way.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters winner was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the cowards Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official section, the illustrious society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two U.S. presidents disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm them - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be different, Trump claims.
He will drive back regulations massively, and he will make himself strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to carry out, that it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they must be invested in it almost once in a while.
The democratic candidate announces even the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are for example strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of Republicans.
Trump could thus have a lot of internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and bring coal production up again in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, and the Paris climate protection agreement will be announced.
With its investment program, Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They are supposed to be better paid, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be raised, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the wide debate over the coming months is more likely to be about the tax policies of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth, is on the other.
His critics insist that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton stands, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution.
Escape: "Every fledgling woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of the everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is not more than a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks in the room with big eyes curious.
His mother is staring at the tabletop.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is Managing Director of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bavaria, and deals with women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
Recently, she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has on her escape experience of sexual violence," Bahr says.
"Men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced worship, murders of honor, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives her away.
It's on the run.
"For example, that tugs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rare," Bahr says.
And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that that ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, errs, Bahr tells.
Even here, single women in refugee homes would often be considered inferior and would be at worst abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.
"Some of the children have certainly not been created voluntarily".
Many women are used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
Since they often don't know how to help themselves, more accommodations need only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich in its area of competence, some reply with no.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.
Even in Schwaben, refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, State Press Officer.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mid-Franken there are in some common houses or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
"If the privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, it can come to - continuing - violence against women".
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the request of the house in Munich.
"Since we talked about it, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Auxiliary doctors: Demands for new work-related measures
Substitutes of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new work-related measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to adopt more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns of the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "severely calm" to problems, which resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has called for official renegotiations for all your concerns."
In response to government silence, the JDC Executive Board has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour struggle measures that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors stretching six times this year, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty would necessarily be introduced for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't stand the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handbeat, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slumbery, and he hardly sparked warmth, even for his reluctance.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report full five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as being as if something bad had never happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But one of Putin’s exhilarating, sustainable cooling showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was wouttbrannt.
Putin split out and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Restoring fat faith will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed that the Turks were to be blamed for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehement.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from his office during a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have severely affected Turkey - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are taken up again.
They count on a late seasonal storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there for a long time, tomatoes here for a long time."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power to be a weak response.
To this end, the continuing groll over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is determined to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with certainty for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime changes.
The summit in this magnificent palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that are out of the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not even taken the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoid answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member of Turkey shot off the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been dissociating since then, when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
In this period, brand-travers used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand becomes our investor brand as well as the brand where our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with our customers under these brands.
RBS has already declared that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport-sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night, which is being trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who won Ghayyar before that, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jubilation when he takes the victory on pre-dilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few before him.
It has style and is strong, but it is its tactical intellect, which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador to race, his enthusiasm and charisma have inspired fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie to Epsom a few weeks ago that he had already won 6,000 winnings if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the cover of the British Flat Race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glory Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulty at first when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to shake his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not in the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin ordered "the release of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's alternate since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he was later chief of the minutes and head of staff of the government.
About his appointment he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding legislative drafts and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the consequence of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, once wanted to direct Russian environmental policy - was on great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people to whom he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before he announced his termination.
At the set, artistic differences and differences of opinion arose.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later stage according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth season is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spouted by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "deck blows", which approach completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 screw ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens Ferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used solely for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridged decks at their place and the last section of the deck today have a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the North Tower deck, we then had to close the existing gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern delivery bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of approximately 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances that the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Lucky to be alive"
Three men have "to be happy still alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm, after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on by their own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in their vicinity and presented us with the worst," said the director of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond its reach until we let it go to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued from a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it dislodged itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was identified.
Someone's been watching about these men today.
Heavily injured - man stands on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured him.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrators cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he got into the apartment, he got into her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
During the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the road they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
For the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a concept of living.
But strife is programmed.
First of all, it's about the question: Who actually should build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation.
The SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be considered as social housing in future."
The low-cost apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the big point in the town hall is, Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent but as much as 20 percent of the homes as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left wants even tough conditions for investors.
Regardless of that, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is deepening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're gonna get the professionals.
But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 low-cost apartments that will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning-political spokesman Nicole Palm, emerging bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing homes back to price union.
This is possible in the western city.
On one occasion, the problem could be solved.
Because in the west city there are deadlines for the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies don't want that.
Because the number of social housings in the western city is increased again dramatically, one is removed from the aim of so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
The group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on the boat."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, is that there can still be a compromise.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been sued by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about bringing people off the sofa and letting them get active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly limited to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "caught".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the fool and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person makes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed-up people who exercise 30 minutes every day, came from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes' time," "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to indicate them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoor that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are murical losers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its stimuli and the use will delay with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tournament
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is on all this immun.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Hardly on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast came up with a multi-combat title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles is playing on the floater during the women's single multi-combat finale in the art tournament at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and overall the fifth, while strengthening her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts her into the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps who have brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has won her sport for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
It expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between the biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between them and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would have been considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-competition finals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, took place on Thursday.
Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation sign at the retirement party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey, this is not really true.
Some of their ground exercises - including their typical tumbling pass - are matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boranman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boranman, became a force.
It has not lost any multi-competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina was lightly guided by two spins, the image was drawn.
Schwebebaren and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the world champion title - were watching.
With 15,433 she got back on the floating beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor she put another on it.
Raisman gently hugged her as she expected her end-of-life - a pure formality - and tears streamed to biles of shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a teapocket.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: shot 3 victims in serial murder while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who have been killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder since a decade, while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police announced that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether she was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-time murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Researchers found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It will be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't let myself in on that.
What's not right at all -- of course it's been turned on," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing,'" said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walk.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year of life and he can still not speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
It can run with support and bike.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund has conceived for "Please sing to me"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life that infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional prize of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers with birth damage caused by the zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Major rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. It is expected to be more rainy all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to help with the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had asked for ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabamas a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued raining in the area of Mobile.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite river near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as it will only slowly flow across the rivers that pass into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still feeding people out of the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said another stepson would have warned him who lived nearby.
"We woke up and the water streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said that she had never seen such a high tide of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread out" since there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities did not consider escape instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported rain near Livingstone from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the rains have significantly affected the soil since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure to teach in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The head of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuaries.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their houses," he said.
In the city of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take part who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported flooded, but on Friday none have been reported until now.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Walked by Balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police informs that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already for the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered multiple fire injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He's gone through a lot, his little body was soaked by balls," his grandmother Delores told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was classified critically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the station that he was expected to be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is critical; the other two victims are stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found.
Researchers informed CBS Philadelphia that it had apparently come to a crossfire between several shooters.
Patrons for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overshadowed the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were cases.
There seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police chief Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police station.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbag on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I present under the women's Olympic team in the turn, and that's for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer olympice since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is proud of everyone.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years the number one was among the female gymnasts was an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they provided unexpected yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-combat event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how turn classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that gymnastics is a expensive sport and turner primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who come up for training, decorating, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these gymnastics lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boranman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the turn.
We need to give the communities countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more conductive and accessible turntrain.
I've founded my 20-year turnover.
At my events we offered free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer the youth high-quality turns that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to take an interest in the turn and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, get her so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officers of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to necessarily introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Nomansland" and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care time.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication: "Assistance doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors properly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new treaty, progress will have to be made and time will run out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions were inconsistencies with the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
That happened of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month about his door being always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to take further work fighting.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a suspension of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and specialists were involved in providing medical cover on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work fighting does not reach anything of the few, but already overloaded teams and service providers and only prepare the patient, nurses and their families for anxiety, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant doctors and have responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional career, training staff, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was to employers, health education England and the health ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine, after the authorities have recommended that this more people be given for a longer period of time.
The anti-inhibition drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medication has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.
NICE’s NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NICE’s NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form surfaces.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guidance by NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack, or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
The culture of political correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption from office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of misuse of election due to "hypersensitiveness to ethics and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of election booths in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommended that voters have an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter must name only his name and address.
The report suggests putting unremovable ink on a person's fingers when they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud, which goes along with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a Special Election Court decided that, after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office, the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed.
The court ruled that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person chose to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming response to the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including running evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "The pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, has been demonstrated, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistanic or pacist backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivitys about ethics and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists to process letter electoral documents to stop "teachers".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks in order to prevent the use of the election directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to block election stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates a charge for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksverrettungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Requires that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishable" that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no criminal charge.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate for impermissible because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It has become known for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings, for sufficient reason.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhake checks" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Scrambled for Kate's cyclist-doppelganger and other famous Olympic athletes double-goers in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiade in Rio took advantage of the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot this week, except for Rand and Band, who proved to be an impressive double-tracker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympic is by far not the only gold-combating athlete who has his own famous double-goer - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has produced a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Besides Kate's double walker on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter, after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret.
In fact, the archer got mad at the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for facial hair," said Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good looking guy, so I'm going to take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more on this year: the all-embracing similarity between the British wide-spring Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass through as a double adult for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gang higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-brown skin and blond hair as the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar appearance and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smiles, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner in the Turnen Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Freestyle Swim Swim Swim Swim on Wednesday's CBC Live Transfer
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize, after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer went off like Mief and died like a pig during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle pool.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the CBS commentator team to give more color, could be heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went down like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Spectators throughout Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how a pig died"???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The critique against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many spoke to him
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how unsensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angeekelt.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We apologize for the comment about a swim performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, and we're sorry it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized to the people who responded to the notice about Twitter over 90 times.
The commentator Scott Russel had to apologize in the name of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who were complaining about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our spectators on mission and to our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming season in the CBC Olympic Mission, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no contempt was intended and I'm very sorry."
Buyers in Primark bemoaned about women trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf.
She continued to stifle and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she moved back and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took out a pair of underpants, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, mad like Oskar."
"Each one stared when she pulled out the underpants that she apparently did not like, as she put them back into the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed up and went out.
"She didn't seem to be disturbing that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that had another person and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I have come along, the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I hate going home with a new pair of underpants and finding out that another woman was wearing her and was pulled out again and she wasn't washed."
One speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our Folkstone branch."
All products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from arms attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mikrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the shot for your robber.
If you're close from behind, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then get the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the body and twist, while the attacker collapses before pain, the gun out of his hands. Beat him with the run into the face and move backward while they target him.
For attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
Simultaneously reduce weight on the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and target the weapon.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it's going to be in the middle of the world.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money in a robbery - unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtyst places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and würgereflex to a serious test by making some of Europe's most dirty and obscene places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk swabbed his career on a euro scene, a terrain at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to let himself in.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely offensive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as his own health.
Luckily, nothing left him behind more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries to railway stations to toilet sink buttons, the task of which made his immune system definitely under a sample
In the film, he said: "I was quite unconcerned when I was a child about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely right about his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample mark showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is close to the worst I smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's ugly in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company has replaced Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Saws and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We ran crazy brainstormings, which ended by saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I'd ordered him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent, said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clumsy holes, wood pieces were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she is afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I believe that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property is probably not considered as beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had committed involved street fighting with baseball batons, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, was ordered in June for antisocial behavior.
In some rooms of the house, which may be destroyed, old waste was found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past, wood pieces have been torn apart
Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing, and her partner, made a violent denunciation of the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.
Delogation was hailed by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They don't yell at anybody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horribly seen for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who courageously approached us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had known herself the possession of a Class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After being without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say she'll delogate tenants who don't stick to the house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police informed that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the rules of the household.
"This is true of those who think they can behave without self-probation, as well as of those who have been hurt by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicted after a deep military jet beach flies
Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Forces made an incredible crash flight
Air Forces reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when scared tourists start panicking after a deep-flighted jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video shots showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity to the sun's worshipers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jump up when they began to understandably worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling down."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese Air Forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, land fires nearby were somewhat deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that security was not at any time threatened.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which limited his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first prize in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against the FC Seville, and the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must, by force, refrain from the lower Cup finalist and reigning European League champion on Neymar, among others, who competes with Brazil the Olympic Football Tournament.
In addition, Goliath Marc-Andre is missing at the crossroads.
In training, the German suffered a immersive dive in the knee, which at least clarifys the question at Barca for the first time in favour of Claudio Bravo.
For two years now, the Chilean International and Ter Szen have been playing for the first time in Barcelona.
Coach Luis Enrique refused to make a clear decision on this so far and left Bravo in the league, but for this to happen in most of the other contests.
Before the first game of duty of the new season, there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the sample gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Seville, on the other hand, has the 2:3-dead after the European Supercup has been extended against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona has won 11 record winners in this competition so far.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olympician.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided finale on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinaese on the top Olympic Treppchen was the former SVS-Nö-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Mom and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the Tribune and had their shooters disbanded in the fair competition alone.
"I've played the matches for my country."
"I play for myself in the finale," Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners poised with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one side.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the pace on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected rousing match.
Nevertheless, there was enough breathtaking ball change to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter finale, the Weißrusse had committed an infringement of ribs against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, who was then in medical treatment, had to be "last" satisfied with sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-Vierts in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump accepts huge problems′′ in the electoral struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about abandoning its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large and confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House grew.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.
Debt were false reports of his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media student.
Republican Hochburgen Wachkeln
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey of SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump at the front, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are at risk.
In an interview by the station CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton: "Genauso, how I did it so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will either be successful or I will make a very nice, long holiday.
He doesn't do anything but "tell the truth."
If, in the end, for reasons of political correctness, it is not enough, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party is supposed to have threatened to delete funds to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of this, the Republicans' candidates would like to be more impoverished for the Congress.
Olympia: Third fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are threatened with a threat after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed about the immediate establishment of a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and today Coach, John Anzrah, had given a Urin trial in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping controls on Kenya's team management.
The World Association of IAAF asked the IOC for information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, announced an IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping Control Station and has spent himself as a Ferguson Rotich who gave and signed the sample," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the world anti-doping agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He should have informed sportsmen of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, when he returned to Nairobi Airport, he was arrested.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping events for a long time.
The announcement of more than 2000 doping targets in front of the Rio games by the IOC has unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken to the visor.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fight is consistent with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, there have been repeated accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this type of sport has been covered and systematically dipped.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral tomb the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he warms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with Wehmut, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So it is smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor to work with her for us.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
One sees it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl, who joined ISIS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, said that reports died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bollwerk of the group in the country, reported news on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she intended to leave the land of war and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London went on an airplane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of a election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Mitch McConnell Senate believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton Garland to choose "with some degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination were lakaien and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants nudist calendar for "Women and for men"
The Treaty magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nudist magazine was different from Oldschool playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I'll do this for women.
Apparently, he is of the opinion that it does the Kalendar too.
"We have to return again to the presentation of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release for the Kalendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", the association president Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I will continue to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association president Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already crossed Kurdish highlands months ago with criminal acts, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the strangled coup, even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitian cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure of exit on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the German government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany, too, a "hexen hunt" against Erdogan critics takes place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionllers.
The brandmarking as a gulen trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, "the world".
As the newspaper reports under appeal on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented before the coup the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people, with almost 29 percent of all recognized as an asyl-authorised (39,625).
In this survey there are no fleas before war, poverty, or perceptiveness.
Asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Where to go, where it blows"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get from the summer election struggle - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the Landtagswahl will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more stupid than it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites itself.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The most popular holidaymakers in the country traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers hang up posters, balloons blow up, flyers spread and at the end of the day score voices are just tiring.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign close to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong Neuling AfD is cut off and what remains in the end coalitionable.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks at his major posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and lurks a little with the people, just as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is blamed for the blooming of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, her "We create this", has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make elections at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to grand rallyes; Merkel Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But there is no harm in listening to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely avoids the usual election positions in marketplaces and before shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country, you growling the base that it must make a lot of effort to find another wire to the people.
It's like the left, the SPD, the green: there's hardly any in the distance of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-invented: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election struggle.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to make the leap into the country day.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday note and place their election struggle largely on the Internet.
"Online-Wahlfahrt", it calls state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just going through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also likes it.
Her impression: "Valid in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to sniff.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and only ends at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tacty," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October everything will be finished.
It also praises the presence of those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to setting up emergency entrances.
Since the construction site has been moved south on Monday and the blockage of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The escape through the place seems to go back.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Transport Management responsible for the renovation.
The residents of Bachsettstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many slings were looking for themselves and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.
What resulted in some trucks being fed into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality called for more of the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable overruns," says King, who on the ground made himself aware of the situation.
There have already been flashed two to three per minute.
The fastest was at 77 kilometres in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become calmer.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue cuts in their sales, lets anyone asked to see.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier car house, but also admits that, of course, "the career is missing".
The most bred are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That's already existential.
Not only him, but all the restaurants hit it hard.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss of turnover is "over 50 per cent".
The road refurbishment dropped its operation "by two years".
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have responded differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts, where such a bit more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
The fact that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic, he can understand.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
The fact that his stem clientele returns after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner keeps the impact of B 27 building works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in her long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being passed.
According to the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All of his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, said the Federal Minister of State when presenting his new security package.
They don't exaggerate anyone.
Other, further issues would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as the Interior Minister, he was on the verge of results and was at a "successable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière failed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Some things have already been known, announced, surveyed: The fact that a new security authority is supposed to care for the knacking of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.
Partly, the Maizière launches a second run for proposals that have not yet been to be made with the SPD: He wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to turn jihadists off the German passport with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any opportunities anyway.
The Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans speedy procedures for deportations and more possibilities for incarceration of people before being deported.
Refugees, who are specifically brought to the country, are supposed to have their smartphones checked in advance and reveal social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of toleratements for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to cover up their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally hesitant.
Some also seem uncooked and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the treatment of patient patients - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied people could not be excluded even in election times.
The internal security is enormously focused.
Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting their hands on internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties had grown high.
Only a coveted argument about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some of the Union's ministers, in which the district leaders also demand a Burka ban and a rejection of double citizenship.
De Maizière is also tired of conciliating tones.
He has nothing to do with a departure from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It doesn't make sense to reopen them.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally fixed at all corners and whether it is actually "mutable" for the coalition partner, it still has to show itself.
There's some in there that could cause strife.
But also the SPD is currently trying to profile itself in the matter of internal security.
Chief of the Party Sigmar Gabriel first signaled a careful willingness to talk and said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to further increase security".
Volkswagen's still coming through in a glamorous way.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery figures rise worldwide.
But it is not going on in all markets.
In the recall operation, there is a vortex around one term.
Volkswagen starts with extraditions in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car builder, despite its many brands and some well-performing markets, has been able to continue to offer an increase in the previous year.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus re-taxed the total sale, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
Worldwide, VW sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, extraditions fell by almost a sixth.
Brand Sales Chief Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two less sales days in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" has given rise to a retention of purchases.
In addition to the situation surrounding the couptic attempt in Turkey, the British vote on withdrawal from the EU had also been burdened by one speaker.
In the U.S., where the escalators first escalated, there is also a minus of beech.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
All in all, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still in the glare of the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition of 0.9 percent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
CEO Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas test.
VW alone calls about 2.5 million cars to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars does not have any negative effects.
After upgrading the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car builder post-retrofits the customer a "guarantee equivalent" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason are legal units.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guaranteed its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This would have confirmed last Monday's VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has full compliance with the requirements of my investigation commission and KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has accepted the guarantee that no deterioration will occur in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after retrofitting and that all type-approval-related vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will come to a workshop half a year after the upgrade with motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of customers, it is also important to avoid that any other damage which is not related to the exhaust canal is caused by any uncertainty as to the possible warranty arrangements as it was called.
That's why VW did not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands fines from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Daily Money accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a case and does not see any signal in it: normal savers would "not be afraid to pay for their savings-gross fine interest".
Banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 percent of the fine interest.
As of September, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund will reclaim private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For some time he has been keeping 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not use.
"These are mine on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't pay EUR 4000 for every million."
The cost is now passed on according to the polluter's principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberys, I don't have to take the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperation association Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "not permanently possible on an economic basis".
Some German banks have therefore increased their account, credit cards or transfers fees.
With fines for deposits starting from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land and its Skatbank-Filiale 2014 had made headlines.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Bank Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive charges for deposits, but competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at the Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat richer equipped by the wealth".
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperation association Bayern "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate an extra charge for deposits of private customers," said spokesperson Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to please this in the widths.
Destination Plates: who actually buys records?
Lone men of middle age love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment part to oversow it under the pseudonym AllEinsameMenMiddlerAlder with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-pronounced resurgence of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that welcomes the novelty of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are all foresight between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group from 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and staggering wildly before I stop, holding my hands and saying something determining like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly fails at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record special stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men of middle ages) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, shown above (he sent me the grip by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and to buy again items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are due to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hub, people who have heard about the comeback and see each other buying their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually cleared up their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record shops provide a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been instigated by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," says Wez.
That's what I'm doing as a collector, and I think that's the case with many people.
It's a simple way to deal with yourself spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member of a panel fires off.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, as I leaf through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three men of middle ages), has noticed a "trophaene aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-loaded, less music-loaded.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated the records to almost an entire floor, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and women middle age.
Although the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz crowned from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look lonely, but nagging mental traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the shop for a few minutes and looking at the vaität of plates for sale.
She's making a window wrap rather than a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a infatuated sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be patterning the jeans hot pans, I observe a group of young teenage girls who for a moment group around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It is pure "Plattenkunst".
But considering that each attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and that some customers could send into the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most for luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning scubabing through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the staring look of an eerie 30-year-old false moderator who excites the shoulders of unsuspecting men of middle age.
Greenland is the longest living cyclone - video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all cyclones on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in a female that assumes it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses offer on the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to cancel dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court proceedings this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be entitled to cancel 72 provisional transactions in which persons in the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, hairdressers or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simply sell meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also argued that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of Calais' prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downrising was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is served in a non-profit way and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "is for these children of a catastrophe, of which the last eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Reguees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
In spite of his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be interrupted.
"I continue to keep my eyes on the World Cup, remain confident and fight on," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's timing," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title at the time of World War II in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed lately."
"This also counts my position," wrote the three-time Zeitfahrt World Champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to the 54.5 km in the Olympia winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund misses half-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finale of Rio: The world rankings 32. out of Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Seigemund, which was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass its impact once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday there was still medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas brought a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
There had been two German DTB starter in the quarter final of summer games last in 1992.
A German duo never stood in an Olympic single half-final.
Group increases on startup for live video game transmissions
watching other people play video games is a huge trend – Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money for the takeover flows, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment.
The Player's Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry already stops.
The start-up staff, which has previously been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, move to Microsoft's headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salzaemdi announced.
The acquisition should therefore not change anything for customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's shaver has to adjust to the next generation speed meter: in various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are designed to transfer speed-sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at major accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to clean bridges with temporary speed limits there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-absorbed: Its battery holds five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not easy to climb, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also shotproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states according to Vitronics.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: Recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain brings silver in the 7th rugby after Fiji holds masterclass gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last barrier in the form of Fiji on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-sapping, rear-back, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was swallowed by the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall back on them in the finale.
But in this form Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Britman will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago she lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here she only lost one.
This slug is hurting, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started with a wonderful start and had GB's attacks flashed out of Spass.
It felt like you were running in driving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co.. The World Series winner went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
At a time of four minutes, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he changed.
12-0 and GB barely hit the ball.
A prominent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou visited through other weak tacks of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.
That's the way it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the phyian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time ratios until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea Insulators whose fans sang, he swung flags and danced on the Tribune.
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-boot in the last seconds with another attempt.
The pipe was sounding, the Fijis hugged themselves, and GB slammed into the lawn exterminatingly.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a short half-final match from the race - Great Britain’s transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winnings - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than these games, and that will mean something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hieves entering history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two who were sitting on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was allusive when they rowed the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that laid such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unbeatable commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that slide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to total.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive that day than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances that is even the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who spent a nervous morning with it a little more than usual talking and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to let go of it.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was a Olympic winner.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity provided
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retired.
The association is considered to be "a model of Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was in the original sound in a contribution from the Bayerische Rundfunk.
Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "almost exemplary".
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was a staff member for 31 years, of whom 28 years as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and communities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed Water Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water management construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and initiation of the new well (1994), real estate purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the sub-renewal of water pipes.
There has been no stoppage and one has always taken on innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göllers faithfully, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heartblood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he had the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group on Nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the Unterfranken district.
For this he has received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well building and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3rd.
Here, minus 17 degrees will have to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn one could only maintain once because one filled the high tanks from Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who started the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is dealing openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and is turning to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness had been recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that lies behind two years when I sang to the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Liaisonstat in Bargteheide - Man shoots on companion
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at 10.45 a.m.
"The man himself called with us and indicated that he had shot his partner," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly ordered.
Meanwhile, Germany, Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, musculoskeletal, brownish and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glare.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry the gun with him, so the police.
If you see Sven S., you should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "retirement" state.
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any information about the tattoo or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; but she confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"It's a killing crime."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special insert command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-enhancing and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs at millions of heights.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity funding are from the table.
In the event of the liberation from the renewable energy expenditure of the existing facilities for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) said the "West German General newspaper" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel manufacturers, who use gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption, to make the cashier.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year, according to the German Association of Industries.
Gabriel said the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the European Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEC turnover of 20 per cent apply.
But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on self-power generation.
This largely sets out the status quo of the previous scheme.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry was particularly important.
"In view of our campaign "Steel is a future" this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets are also considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chair Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world's largest producer country in China threw massive steel into the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers submit price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been a bit relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties on imported steel have been shown to have effect; on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been raised.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the steel industry announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced has now returned to each other for the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's value.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to improved order conditions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does good to seniors
Ursel Kipp has been with Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she completed her studies in music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.
By the way, she does something good about her health and mind.
Because Singen is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorsliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often resolve at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Look to agree and organize, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.
In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs doesn't get out of the piste so fast even in everyday life.
Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Seniors.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently notices that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth age.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who suffer from the debilitating end of their lives are becoming aware of long-term events.
During singing, a special performance is also required for the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice something for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the church or the church leader.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, advise Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats respond more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young animals
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mouen did not let the males cold - but they always behaved in the same way as the females.
Female cats can detect the level of excitation of cat babies at the mouth of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens, which are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical University (MHH).
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the mowing of less and strongly exciting young animals for the males are obvious or of no importance," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the team of researchers had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten line differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens were observed from the MHHH.
They were played for a call from little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiatedly to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call of the very more severe kittens was played.
This ability may be inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have even responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, said Biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup, an important football game takes place in Turkey.
Before duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even in the case of the suspension of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July, the government, the everyday life of normal citizens, was not to be affected.
This does not apply, however, to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who are responsible for the coupt attempt.
This is not done even before football.
The prosecutor issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Consequently, the Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be a member of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, it actually has as good as no impact on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared that the next "democracy growth" in public places throughout the country had ended on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas traditionally do not belong to the president's friends.
However, what the majority of the Turks agree on in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military puns.
The fans even agree on themselves - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Pokal's "Gala" there will be a special return to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneer demonstrated his sporting value during the season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" shouted to him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the round-up K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also left the Europa League early on.
In the Süper Lig it was only to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did, and that's the most important," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasons as the Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason that fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, under contract with AC Florence and with Besiktas, had only announced after the coup attempt not to return after his EM holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," quoted the journal "Kicker" Club Chief Firet Orman.
To this end, however, the storm would have to be willing to give up about one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transmitted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of Doping is still the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julia Jefimowa, who, after a doping course, had sued her starting rights just before the games, was mercilessly pruned at her start (100 meters breast).
It was a strange scene: with a set smile, she was still proud in the hall and was provocative with her appearance.
When he found out that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheerstorm.
However, there are many more athletes who, despite Doping's past, start at the Rio Olympic Games.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m season/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already locked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his banning, the 2004 Olympia winner and ex-world champion has been even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest challengeer of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time World Champion had to take off a six-month barrier in 2010 after she had been shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic Champion, 2013 World Champion and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the forbidden methylhexanamin methylhexanamin stimulant.
Perkovic fought the scientific intake and was blocked for six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m season/USA): The Beijing olympician and twice world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A penile enlargement drug had been responsible for expensive Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerlauf, Belarus): Hardly an athlete knew so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was identified with Testosterone Doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia Silver 2004 due to steroid-dopings and the EM-title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also accepted by the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km) Go, China): The world recordr and gold favourite was only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the use of a prohibited food supplement, the barrier of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran off on 13 July.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Foreign Minister, Thomas Schnoll, on Friday morning.
She had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave them.
She was planning her trip home for early September.
Whether the other explosions on the Phuket holiday island as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the approximately 200 km south of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a district of two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday two more explosions went up, according to the authorities, another human being was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured at the demonstration near Patong’s popular beach for holidaymakers according to police records.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban worker.
According to the authorities, the explosion rate had gone into the air in a flower beet in front of the area of the coastal police.
Finally, demonstrations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast called for several injuries.
It was called a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We expect this to be a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bomb-enhants of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said one spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Over the past few days, the authorities have received classified references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country, although they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they usually don't fight tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used over years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bombing explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities must comply with the instructions.
High security risk (safety level 3) for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, no necessary travel in these provinces is recommended.
Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to set chaos while the country moved towards stability, to improve the economic situation and tourism.
The military unt, who had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, has benefited himself from once again leading the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not succeeded in getting the grip of the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been swirling in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Just a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people had been killed in an attack on a popular Hindu train - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
The right "Identitarian Movement" has come to the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also observed the group.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' clues for efforts against the democratic freedom of the basic order," said head of the constitution Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now too.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multikulti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitarians".
Maassen said that his authority had voted closely with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Chief of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-oriented language, often with poppy music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists did.
This is not a proper advertising for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently there had been reports from several federal states on contacts between "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maassen said he didn't know.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain people who are extremist, who become so extremist.
So it is decisive whether such persons have taxing influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maassen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are planning the attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European control of right-wing terrorism would not be recognizable.
So far, the groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Maassen expressed his concern that many attacks went on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
This is the alarming thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"A lot of people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent, or who have chosen CDU, SPD or left-wing, but who have then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Hatte becomes the Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros has at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected.
In the social networks, Habe became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his premise with a residue of 48 seconds and held the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was more his not just sporty figure that drew attention to the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start-up right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros hat is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made himself funny about him in connection with a "Wohlstandsbuch".
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani made media attention available.
The swimmer's appearance in Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to enter the open style alone in a prelude over 100 meters.
At the time, Moussambani was fired in Frenetisch.
The 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
A seat in the front row on the breathtaking architecture of the central library of Los Angeles

An open industrial loft in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th anniversary of the L.A. Central Library with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a store at the Neue Platz has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretswärter had left her business on Monday around 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 p.m., 250 euros had disappeared from the cash desk.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is no video surveillance either.
Trump doesn't look so narrow on the threatening electoral situation
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If it's not possible to vote for the U.S. President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, and he doesn't care about it: "It's either going to work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If, in the end, for reasons of political correctness, it is not enough, Trump said.
He thus described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, as founder of the Islamic State of Terror (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the risk seems to be great.
The post plans to sell her electric car StreetScooter as well.
Soon the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The post also wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from the coming year.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it should sell its self-developed StreetScooter with letters and packages to other companies as well.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said there were always demands, for example by artisans.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly.
In post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and a complete changeover to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK guidance takes place after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann is becoming all the more uncertain, the longer the successes he has promised remain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After another disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of corporate governance, the worldwide number five of the industry stands ahead of a new human beginning.
GfK Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The Executive Board's leadership already took over the board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company announced.
He is supposed to officially assume the function of a "Chairman" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawals, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't mean to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that shareholders had recently been disappointed by the remaining successes of the restructuring started years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK summit since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring cannot be seen even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company could not have stopped its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 percent.
The profit in the second quarter has particularly affected the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The Company Value Depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business, gave the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had achieved a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into squirrels in graves: eight injured
In the event of an accident at a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid their information from an opposite truck, which was partly on the counter-train.
The bus came to the right from the street and jumped into a grave, as a spokesman from the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and one emergency medical car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The unscathed travellers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water are 3,44 euros instead of 2,10 euros for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkohl waste water treatment plant from 1 October 2016; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (up from 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (up from 2,18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excess calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Landratsamt Kulmbach established that undercovers are open for these waste water facilities.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the facilities on a cost-effective basis.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the money bags.
The fees increase is between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market municipality was necessary.
Over- or under-coverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated between October 2016 and September 2020.
The major increases in fees led Schmidt to the fact that all three waste water facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the run-up to waste water in all three plants would be slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in the last calculation period all three plants did not last have a significant amount of restructuring and repair costs due to their age.
The site in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
In the Welchenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be unloaded from the ground and at the Lopp pond clearance plant had to be excavated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first treatment pond, the treatment sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed to meet the water requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that, in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "full of cost".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community has been spared from major entertainment costs for the wastewater systems in the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the waste water-use association Friesenbachtal could not be extended because these are deficiency facilities.
Bulgaria booked inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% have been booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %, measured according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
Inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a rise in prices of the following consumer goods was observed for the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2 %); various goods and services (0.3 %).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained the same as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; as well as education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticizes as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurdity.
You can turn into an pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblomed, characteristic twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All wrongs come to the public.
Snapchat-Filter has in the past been criticizing the fact that the Blackface app would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users proposed a filter that gave them sluggish eyes, false teeth and dim cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was designed as a tribute to anime character and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of infringing clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely used over the photos, wrote that the filter was "infringing and reluctance."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very repulsive Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosss this cultural pride wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless battle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's big audiences of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - could rather expect to be sensitive.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, requested others to do the same.
In an article for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"No matter whether they have a different representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company has recently hired a staff member who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said that she was leaving her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this isn't OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, sets out Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than allowed on-site states, a congress investigation committee reported in a Thursday report.
The provisional report, prepared by a Task Force of Republican members of the armed forces Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"A more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," said a newspaper article.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, Central Command's peaks changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "was delayed in the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morals among analysts and "gave excessive room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention at the Centcom analysts regarding a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, who received complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press speaker, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress reports while the General Inspector's investigations were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite different opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have retroactive effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the twilights of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only a small crew force in Iraq foresaw and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, according to government agencies, the team around Mr. Hooker notes that, contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, reports the Times in September.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain is coming
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3.0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she can't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are right in their group with the British in the first place, which remain unbeatable after their 2.0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which one of the two within their group will win the first and second place each from six teams.
The first-placed man will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way, leading the other group.
However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first three-year-old hockey bat in her hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a U.S. national player, the latest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympiade because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was coached by the National Team and thus began to turn things into better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.
We've been able to rip the row around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand hit from the near area.
India went into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and lipped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2.0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the tournaments for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolines
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast-paced seasoning between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is rendered a triathlete from the armbrush to the turner.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the coffee shop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is present for the first time at the Olympic Games and is a female shoal with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and benevolent TV advertising if he was a swimmer, Turner or even fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not light up every event equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air guns shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may rule it for a long time.
But if I humbly make arguments for my particular lover, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it was debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived over the past 16 years that many of those I had asked did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians that for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a hard-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonlike tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie des Turns and Diving, the two types of sports that it basically unites.
The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "stripboard."
Stirring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (throws, hedges and nets) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their quest for gold, medals must continue, faster, go up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
Not only do they hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but they also pursue another heinous goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympia record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I myself feel when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she is boasting, seemingly troubleless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly going up.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It's just like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
Women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; men's rounds on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by angaffing and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tournaments, according to The Wall Street Journal, recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to ring in air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations demanding political changes in Ethiopia have fought for violent government resistance.
Witnesses say that forty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shots.
Is Ethiopia just to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that police were shooting and killing on the unarmed protesters.
In circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year, security people show young people beating sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the repression by the government - opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and don't have any other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the gist of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulences and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why after years of simmering under the surface, feelings of bitterness explode.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered in such a way as to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Äons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mostly Christian highlands, have been prosecuting politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that too is changing right now.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in a non-public illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special representatives to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which according to data from analysts were apparently baffled by the government and then stolen.
During the following razzia many Protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting train, as well as for its measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked business led by Tigray and hatred over Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a basis for dronary flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to break up in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin grappling migration."
Donald Trump explained his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been seriously meant the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable manner.
It also brings his competitors who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the statement at a Wednesday evening campaign, Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday with regard to the claim, insisting that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump in a series of interviews said he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The final storm of criticism is calling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he attracted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" according to how the reaction is not. "" said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of reducing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more appalling tone, as his survey figures have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a major lead in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump in general tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is more focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal fellow fighters to the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statement that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them a backman, completely wrong and because of that it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by refusing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and of being prejudiced against him.
He mocked the "poor, young" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apologies as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once forced over the price from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from Bedford Avenue Ladenfront have been driven away.
Soap Cherie, who replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Homely, it was the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer told him to provide money for a new outside site, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot in it.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishings such as capers and sawed onions.
There are nature travel committees.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven out by Williamsburg's prizes," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the verb of coffee and culture that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't get a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-fried coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intended to put it off soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has additional advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-fried coffee into the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a trait and said that he was destroyed when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering felt a new coffee like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a connoisseurs, President Roosevelt had a fable for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purea and as dessert a plump pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing house on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, was eating turkey with potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of great depression.
"A lot of food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that spreads the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe limit.
"It must have been lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Mean" marks the paths the country was dealing with to be no longer the Schlaraffeland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense theme for the Americans," Coe agreed, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as bread and coffins became basic food to reuse the checkout role as "wonderful way to re-use food remains," said brickman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During their research for the book, which includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical of many of the domestic recipes.
As never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have so much driven the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and to meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Mean" is a festival of historic treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mych-Kuche-Essen-Hältung, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millions of heavy men of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully different from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to establish an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most unscrupulous prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back to its legs.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said brickman, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple said that when writing the book, they had better understood the eating habits of brickman’s mother - for example, how they could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home: the fungus endert, President Roosevelt at lunchtime.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dived a little reluctantly a spoon into the tough, brown gliber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a reference three times.
Like a Can-Do Buddhist, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the photo magazine, had saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to draw people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protector showing him the world in 2014 when a baby was rescued from the ruins of a house.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
As heroes, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture said, "For me this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees a martyr inside of me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to strike terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young people 150 years of age.
Mostly Greenland shark swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a height of 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
This lifestyle, which is characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Wonderful", says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea on the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures by 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear at the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measure time gap when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, prey do these sharks: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seals; another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt for sleeping animals or patrol them at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers torping down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks, who between 2010 and 2013 brought fishermen before Greenland or Spittsbergen as a by-catch from the depth of North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres in size.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens emerges before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts smuggled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, however, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is expected to be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenlandhai female only got young ones when they are more than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be increased for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrates at present.
That such methuseums live primarily in icy waters is not a coincidence.
Also the record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harp-pun tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on asparagus flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal brings warmth.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
The municipal council has focused on building issues at the recent meeting.
With ease, the board noted Mayor Robert Putz's communication that "the marketing of recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development questions have been clarified and the applications for survey have been submitted, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Development Section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and scaffolding seniors alike.
As it was called, constructionists can immediately report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to be consulted in its September meeting.
In order to also meet questions concerning the creation of further commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas that was newly created only in the spring of this year.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the already designated commercial area is expanded by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best opportunity to attract shifted jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit grant," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may operate further from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, registration in the UK has so far been sufficient for them.
It's using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced shifting jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board EIOPA and the Risk Council ESRB.
Although the OECD has its head office in Paris, it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is also a poor one in terms of infrastructure in Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy-to-available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
At Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than on Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer stood the city on place seven, Luxembourg on position 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris on 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW follows.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economics researchers believe.
This is also what the conditions of strength speak: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, some 4400 people worked in the banking industry, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to refund the legal costs incurred by Gilead Sciences Inc from the Hepatits C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two patents of Merck, which were related to the Sovaldi and Harvoni blockbuster drugs of Gilead, after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misbehaviour on the part of Mercks, including myids and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, U.S. official judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to charge the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to draw on Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
U.S. supported troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic state
Supported by the United States troops have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DPS) are combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, told Sharfan Darwish of Manbij's Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleanup work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her tax declaration for 2015, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for benevolent purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonorare; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have published his tax returns over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a short contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreaters in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers, as a reason for his refusal, gave a tax audit by the tax authorities.
"They are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding assets, his donations for benevolent organizations, his business gestures and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on Friday on the Internet in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks him to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here, demanded Trump to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax check by the IRS and Trump had "angst" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax declaration showed that they only earned USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues taxed USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks bodies promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for it years ago, has intensified its funding together with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World elephant's Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe a change of attitude within these communities, with much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powders into the air.
A hint is usually quite already out to chase the elephants.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rainfire into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
St. Goarer usually assumes investment projects by commercial operators with kissing hand - especially retailing in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a new skiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balkans.
"In principle, we welcome new commercialists, but this kiosk does not fit in with this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director beats Berliner Hotel because Israeli election was removed after "Arab" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unburdened a media uproar after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre-election, since according to an employee, Arab guests had "needed".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country electoral list.
The country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him" as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind this was even more intense in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the selection be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman in Germany called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and upset by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in precisely this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater shame.
There's no need for this explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered quite a big resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some of them underwent the Kempinski Hotel that it had "gave up" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Believe yourselves," said another article, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction" Israel did not include in the quick-election list," quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung as a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to separate the students, resulting in the police using rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals made by the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying on walls against the provisional president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate for their resignation.
Russia & Iran trade suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the annual trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, the ambassador announced that the interest on the part of Russian companies grew strongly in business in the country.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The recovery of trade was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
For this year, Dzhagaryan assumes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year the Russian foreign representation issued approximately 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in relation to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses looking for: Drinking market in Waldbröl
A robbery has been committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a firearm, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW wave.
How much money has been exploited, the police don't tell us.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the robbery towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the perpetrators must have fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (schladernring).
Anyone who has observed at the time of the act (compared to 7.45 p.m.) that is related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and fun at Summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Association with their attendants at their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the peacefully located Hardtwoudle leisure home, the life-loving group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Brett with the visit of the sniper.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guided tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celts Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Deep Sea in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plant.
Culinaryally, children and caregivers with their self-prepared body dishes such as the acid spätzle, the Seebronn Pfänle, Isselhauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese were spoiled.
In workshops, a bamatic, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "bunt evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The mini-stars from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna , were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were occupied together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwall ride of all ministrants in expected two years, the St. Anna Oberminstrante Round decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage targets were examined and the decision was finally made for the bishops city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered with the gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
In the evening before, Father Storost sent out pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the cross of pilgrims and granted the Pilgrimage.
From Horb, he was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster Our Lady standing and thus the Pilgrimage was taken by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evening.
But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches kept making rest to sing a song from specially composed pilgrims.
The parish houses of the local parish were available for the overnight stays.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
It continued on the second day about Furtwangen to Güttenbach.
The following day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to first descend around 500 metres in the case of sultry heat and then be climbed again.
The deserved reward was a shared grilling at the bathroom wedding in the evening.
After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrims in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
The minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrim's goal were welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.
After the divine service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brit gold for cycling is ringed
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took in the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself himself. The boy-spong made the legend proud when he stormed home in order to win the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they won only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hinds.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinners set a Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which hinds went in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinners to keep the pace.
Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set a Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph at Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell onto the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with the whole GB of flags on the gallery."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that's what we expect for five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an exploit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same thing from Hoy.
Kenny is next to take part in the Sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometers race.
They arrived at the destination at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the Wettboer, where Wiggins will be in the focus with certainty.
He had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification when he was called to himself by officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong train bicycle team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas played in the background, according to the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing accusations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite as if the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's melting plant due to the repeal of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa complex in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Meltery, which led to a closure of the Anglea Power Plant last year.
Alcoa's melting company in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium foundry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company announced.
AGL continued to claim that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in the 17th financial year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL as from the CJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fixed-term markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts at $187 million in the amount of its annual cancellation.
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to guarantee the power supply to the melting plant".
The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a declaration why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Stephen Mikkelsen head of operations said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both plants disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the cove of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to weeping," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashian similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest's most popular showbiz and producers), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast place at 8am in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With an extent that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his coverstar is expected to be so longing that images of the magazine have been sending through before official publication in the last two years.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "families, the models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people today who know how to rotate a good Snapchat video (even if it all comes to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense with her reality TV story.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the news with the appearance of Jenner came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the misunderstanding seems to pass by at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's making advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time she is seen in reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's most need for assistance are rejected annually by the municipal centres, while the sector is focused on the effects of further cuts in resources on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogations and similar - are already being rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are available for further reductions.
As of June next year, these jurisdictions will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The Director of the Community Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the withdrawal of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfinanced, which means thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who were unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance.
We urge the Advocate General and Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these medium-sized cuts immediately so that the people who need them can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign sued after employees allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a firearm to an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini in the State Court of Charlotte on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be dealt with internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "stuck a gun, put his right toe finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's kneel," made Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he reported in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gunowners and arms friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and Philip for physical injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
No response was made to calls from its consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey in front of country values: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This showed representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule almost further, according to the survey values in Berlin, this is not possible.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of continuing to hold the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party thus, according to the survey, only lay close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is between the left and the AfD.
The left side would reach 19 percent (previous to 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country.
Despite slight losses, the Greens relocate to the Schweriner Landtag at 6 percent (before 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be present in the country at 3 percent each.
In the case of the Berlin elections, the poll's SPD would only reach 23 percent (elect 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previous 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entrance in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in storage was initially eight megabytes, which would reach for about two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow derived from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the West Bag format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for standards back then: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was reachable.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.
No one knew in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different ever since.
The clever phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finn's mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market dominates suppliers, all coming much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is for many people everyday today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million pieces.
Worldwide sales of equipment is around 400 billion euros.
These include the well-established operations of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac world.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator to operate everything easily via touch screen.
Apple's winning move began, and still today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had their condolences.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry had to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, each German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away the smartphone," said Janina Ball, responsible for personnel at Siemens' Board of Directors.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country not only in our local communities and throughout London.
This was the biggest attraction for me, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching centres alone, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The two-fliers were wrong in 2012 and they're going to be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of money-creating growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the whole of GB behind.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - elected five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, built in the middle of the two most frequent careers in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by $16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasure
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" with regard to ad block
For companies that earn money using online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass advertising blockage are equivalent to a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it difficult to identify what part of the Advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams spokesperson wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her campaign between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypass has already been in progress since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has been involved in the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue.
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs is a large enough share of revenue, making Facebook appear to be worthwhile investing such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dull means, which is why we have focused instead on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of the people.
Women on likely suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman was killed by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49 wanted to kill herself by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
A investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, was announced by Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - one person walking in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the negligent killing after crossing and killing a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "exhaustive and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could once have shown earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate lives and protect them from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.
The result are average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was once habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen degenerated, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained back -- the Venus we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from Colorado Avalanche as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations on Thursday and led to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50-year-old.
I've been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed off season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers take up talks again, set off strike
The labour struggles with regard to the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the resolution process of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start in the beginning of next year to tackle the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The ratio reduction of the company follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the necessary space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its operations as a result of its mega-conclusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower routing journey, an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in one statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in expenditure on new North Sea projects is expected to be around $7 billion on average over the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the clusters of stars and in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebell, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years away from the earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which came about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're going to be the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars produce large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates points out that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebulll compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars of slow pirouettes turning than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star cluster of Plejaden is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.
"The star cluster of Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, such as the Wie, When and Why Stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak their "dance shoes".
In three newspaper reports Rebulll and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star takes off
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbee' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star-Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and the Yankees since 2005 he created several milestones.
With Hall-of-Family members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be included in the fame hall of the baseball.
For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
In 2009, the superstar admitted "ESPN" to take banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was imprisoned for 211 games due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect, for years through an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida to have received beneficial funds.
After a dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done a favor for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said suffocatingly.
His farewell days are also not noiseless.
While many baseball legends in their last games received the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job includes an attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and who was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy demonstrations by the fans of Yankee Archrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Received: Due to a positive doping sample weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-hinder runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the previously critical athletic competition, these news come to an untimely conclusion.
At Chen, the diuretic diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon time.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had his fourth place in the finals over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
Chen should have participated in the events over 50 m freestyle on Friday.
Chen requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible, but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent that "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, it is intended that the prohibited substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B-probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London olympician in class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon as his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
The Danekova case is especially a major blow for the reputation of the whole sport before the start of the athletes.
The World Association of IAAF had prohibited the complete Russian team from launching until an exception due to systematic dopings, including the Läuferration Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the former crimes in China had also caused fierce clashes between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang horribly.
"Sun Yang pinks purple."
"When I see the stage above 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," he said.
In 2014, Sun had been tested positively for stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit down for a three-month break.
Data Clau: How perfide is extorting hackers their ransom money
Developers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been targeting Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solders required by the perpetrators to be able to re-use the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes watched on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extortioning ransom is much higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly fast evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks has been alarmingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, she is looking for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still standing.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a Ransomware is applied.
22 per cent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt business activity completely, in a case people were at risk of life.
In Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records acutely.
"We always tell the victims: 'Don't pay, you only promote the problem', Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data again.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of the standstill in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try to build up a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take in more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or unscramble for example files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from Ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski explains from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware around a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners are then looking for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service sector.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals then ordered spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the malwarebytes survey rely on being able to deny Ransomware by using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to success, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still much higher than before.
In future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators block a whole production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and day-to-day suitable
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it doesn't work closely.
The materials of the interior are well processed and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
Not only is there a 453 l trunk available for high and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the back seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tried 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is expected to do his work a little less.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-L-Benziner with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The City Not Brake Assistant (worked to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Tracking Assistant is part of the security systems.
The collision warner sometimes annoys because he regards many obstacles as "appropriate objects".
The telelight assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller reacts to the traffic sign detection and dross the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7" touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a little easy to achieve.
The 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol fuel starting from 20000 euros, the diesel starting at 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and day-to-day car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The defendant had broken his knee in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Sickness: When the organizer pays
After their trip, sick holidaymakers will only get back money if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without doubt.
This is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, on the second day of her Turkey holiday, a family was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant that supposedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
Before court, the prosecutors had no success.
Although the treatment plant was in fact defective.
But the organizer did not know about it until shortly before the prosecutors left.
He had to assume until then that the seawater was in order.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially in the samples of water no contamination has been found.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infecting one another - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that according to the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must be sound and determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and strengthen the consent of the population to refugee policy.
De Maizière aims to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced another human strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle of a four-digit scale over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be re-punished.
The aim of video surveillance is to improve the level of arms law so as to make it difficult, above all, to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much debated obligation for doctors to remain silent after the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with doctors, he wanted to look for solutions to how to reduce the risk of citizens, for example, he said with a view to psychological events.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers it necessary to improve social support.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has spoken out clearly against actionism.
"This was an earpiece for the scaffolders in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full closure is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
One could talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses to court.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the minister that he would like to simulate action and action with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left-party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flute sayings and a strengthening of the right of residence no longer bring people in this country security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It regularly stands on the bypass road - here a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-wing trail is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Wesseler Strasse extends the right-wing trail by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Strasse and Weseler Strasse on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Car drivers can then graze directly from the Hammer Street on the right.
The great advantage: The traffic splits up earlier, improving the overall flow on the much-favored section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the doorcar is especially annoyed by drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Werktags extends back to the bridge above the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only single-tracked through the motorway bridge.
The second trail had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the required load capacity to take in heavy load traffic two-track.
The length of this bottleneck and the associated working-day congestion cannot be said by the competent country.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official length of use until the year 2034.
For the extension of the mark, the country's business has consciously chosen the lack of traffic time in the school holidays because of the need for disability.
The traffic will be passed once at the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural trip: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Association of Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Association of Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to offer schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the Scenic pictures and video animations, it had been possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Association of Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Taalel, and the Young Theatre will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without the background of escape and migration between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatral language education are in the planning process.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star sniffs: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made the bill of the star-snipp-Guckers in the south-west of Germany during the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been poor because of clouds and rain to observe the sky’s spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of star sniffs in the sky.
The star scales are Persians, which, at 216,000 kilometers per hour, are among the fastest star sniffs.
Their name is because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening, you wave around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you don't think about sleeping far before the alarm clock.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, such problems are in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as unrestrained.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they may be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what you usually understand is the insomnia, that is, a sleep disorder.
Just sleeping through many people feel as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Hausärzteverband with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this may be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
The sleep disorder is not uncommon expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common with depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interrelated.
For example, anyone who has a disc incident can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and may start grabbing about everyday problems and care, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well and is impaired during a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advise Weeß.
The impairment can look quite different: one is worn off, tired, unsleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical pains such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and not more than two weeks.
There is hardly any sleep medicine left in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fiteze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, when you have sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, advise Weeß.
He can explain with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens?
For example, doctors in the sleep lab advise on snoring with breathing offsets, with sick tiredness of the day, with sleep walkers or if you don't find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After cabling, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal goggle, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can those affected get the handle on the problems?
There are quite a lot of stellar screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep in the day, do not avoid sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is quite not beneficial at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cutting off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had taken gold for the first time during the short-haul World Championships in Doha and also set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his ex-team colleagues, who are critical of this.
"In a country where a Olympic winner gets €20.000 premium and a jungle king €150,000 should not be surprised by missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night to Friday.
The conveying system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and doping does not look as closely as possible or even operate it.
"I don't say that the controls are to be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is the same way one should keep it with countries.
"He who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain time before the World Cup/OS must not participate," calls the Hamburger, who is now operating an ice cream bar.
Airport: Baggage thieves tape arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested.
The suspects had committed several bags and luggage thefts as tapes.
At 21:30 a.m., civilian officials in Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July this year and had done so in a joint, part of the labour market and particularly professional.
The specialists of the criminal commissioner 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, still a rest of the headstones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like this at first glance, but the police are one of the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you walk the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biostore.
To the facade of a gray house someone sprayed "poor!"
Against a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred with burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's inner senator Henkel had expressed itself several times for the police's harsh action against the project, the area is called "no-go zone" for police and the 94 is a starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms had been cleared with 300 police officers on the ground floor on June 22nd, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the room had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers pulled off under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk form late.
A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who wanted to have a majority of police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers' district, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Home occupations and the housing projects born of them belong to the Kiez for a long time: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz road very close to Riga.
While the Mainzers were under great police command in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and campaigners from all over the world. With them, residents from GDR times and former housekeepers now share their choice.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are identified by slices or freshly painted facades that have been thrown with paint bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left-handed violence".
One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as physical injury are directed almost exclusively against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve property damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, she is advocating: the people in the 94s are their neighbors, who certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the clarity over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is taken away from them: by sightless new buildings in former building gaps that disperse the old inhabitants.
"These are, in the end, real estates that are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so well-intoxicated," she says.
"I can't at all approve of violence and destruction."
But what do you do if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Those who move from there should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary authorities are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-legging wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mocking than, rather, targeting the variety of tasks required - had meant that the administration wanted to write out the post.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an egg milk sauce.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuskle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been with him for about six weeks.
It has set a 50 percent mark to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuskle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The cost of building, renting or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from the Landratsamt to the Commune and the Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto the administration does not find private homes.
So far, it doesn't work, so Deuskle says, "you need private homes.
Therefore, public homes need to be invented, as it is called as beautiful.
So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and auxiliary activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Customer.
Many work at the Bauhof or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuskle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That's "no employment therapy."
Activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are weird.
This is also where administration and honorary persons take part.
It is central to the fact that refugees feel that they are desirable and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They need to explain to refugees that it is just a matter of time and that they can make sense to bridge time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling at some point, he cannot help anyone in Urbach, must not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people with nothing at all." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always motivated to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mammut task".
A difficult question: do the two fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after recent events?
"No," says Regine Customer quite clearly, "what some people may call naïve." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers are sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They would be afraid that the perpetrators would call them completely.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, on-site and honorary persons must look for activities in the region.
They have always in the background that a new blow of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is awry.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet, where we're allowed to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, this would relax the situation.
Regine Kunden also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already burdened with the proper integration of the previous people.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, as there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruders looking for helicopters
The police helicopter flew down several areas - unsuccessfully for about an hour.
Two unknown men were violently forced into an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
