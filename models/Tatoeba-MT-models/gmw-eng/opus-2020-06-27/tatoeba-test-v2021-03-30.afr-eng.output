Not only does he speak French but he also speaks Spanish.
I don’t think anything you did came up with.
That's a pretty pair of legs.
One, three and five are uneven numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pins do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It's just not worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.
No one is going to care.
Here, I found it. He lives in Wannlake.
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It will be our secret.
This pencil is white.
He sometimes watches TV.
Drink!
Do not miss the opportunity.
It's a little cool.
He's better than I am.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to view humans as unique, including living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.

If I were you, I began to be immeasurable.
She has blond hair.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I had forgotten him cleanly.
The horse is in the woods.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You should have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the errors if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Many homes were washed away with the flood.
Why Do I Have to Care About Them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick thousand cranes fold, her wish will come true.
Tom left them clean.
Do not be late for the train.
If you find something you're good at and enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.

Tom will help you.
You don't need a boyfriend.

If the idiots were to compete, you would come second, because you are too stupid to come first.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom hadn't come.
I don't want to remember.
Flashy!
They are in the library.
Tom did not do that.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don’t know where we will end up.
Tom got up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sports?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We will not be able to eat everything.
But you well know that these negative consequences would have.
He will never believe me again.

The two villages were separated by a river.
We decided not to release them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.
Tom's eating too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where's the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll get you back to work late.
I am not going to be embroiled to do so.
Everything we can imagine is real, but what really is is the real question.

No one tells me what to do about it.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write an English letter?

From now on, be more careful.
Please go faster.
Where's the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I don't want to lie.

Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I've never met before.
My father’s name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I'm in a play.
Do not believe all that people tell you.
I don't speak good enough French!
I'm not going to be able to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a moist, rough summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I Overcome Later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami repaired it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I put my socks on a jap.
Tom kept trying.
Tom won't dare.
My horse is black.
If it is false, she is a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to mail this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do this?
Don't you add sugar?

She's doing her homework now.
What shirt will you wear to school today?

I don't want to see you.
His Prejudice Jazz
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
May I take a look at your ticket?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out the other way.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I’m sure I won’t be of much help.
The sky is blue, the sea is also blue. The sky and the sea are blue.
Robert was so busy that he had to refuse an invitation to play golf.
Tom won't wait here for so long.
He is my brother.
All human beings are born free, with equal dignity and rights; they have reason and conscience and ought to act toward one another in the spirit of brotherhood.
They worry about her.

He is young.
Tom was busy then.
Who had this ugly house built?
He can't speak much English.
I just wondered if you could still find a place to stay.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom's not leaving.

We have a large garden.
Do not waste your money by buying things you do not need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do that.
She had a house at the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
It's the last straw.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
All of us go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
Not only does he speak French but he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said this? It's completely wrong.
Your name is on the list first.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait that long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates to talk about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun sun down, they left their jobs.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She's running.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that kitten?
He was a good king.
They said that they had always done so.
We are looking for one another.
I'm just looking.
Sadly, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said that he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I would not be surprised.
It rains.
In the past, the boys had been taught to defend themselves while still very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom trembles.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like traveling by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.

He asked my mother.
Does this make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
His music is well - known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don’t want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice, no matter what you say.
That is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom is not going to appear at all.
I must have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he had not kissed Mary.
The clock is ringing.
I'm not going to be able to get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.
I'm a friend of Robert's.
I want to be her friend.
Do not move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
Yesterday this time was unat the cinema.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike's got two girls.
Let's wait until he comes.
Tom dyed his hair dark brown.
That's what you get!
Tom's dying?
A dog ran after the cat.
I too kissed Tom.
Why not join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.
Tom was imprisoned.
It's not a joke.
You promised you would come.
I would be mad to expect such a thing.
Santa Claus remains in the Arctic.
I was born in Tokyo and topped.
I got cold.
Let’s put off the television.
Sadly, I would not be very good company.

I like lynx.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.

He's staying in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and took a flashlight.
I think I might be out of work.
I told Tom I'd be now.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami has to wait a bit.
Are their friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice that.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my dad, do you?
I'm back now with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He is my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks out on the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is able to read.
It appears that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel admitted that I paid the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She murdered herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he is.
I put it where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not yet very hungry.
There is probably an easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We need to start doing this.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I had forgotten her cleanly.
Tom thought this was unfair.
I don't want to get married.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you get up, he will be studying.
I have a sad skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fight lasted for a week.
When was the last time you laughed?
Tom's not going to give a speech today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health taught us through the study of disease.
Tom is sitting on window reading a book.
We are not going to be here to 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so bad at all.
I eat rice.
Can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It rains.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that area.
I bought only a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This cannot be a genuine diamond.
Tom pulled it away.
Was Tom there?
Father recently returned to Japan.
It's my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer getting help from Mary.
I am saving myself so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I am to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You must have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night all cats are grou.
Stiller!
It's my house now.
A bird flies.
He arrived 30 minutes late.
He reaches out to a English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatever a man sows, he will also reap.
I wish you had said it before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom's looking closer.
I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking.
Tom had a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We had forgotten her cleanly.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example, Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's really good!
The river that flows through Parrys is called the Seine.
I am glad you finally came back.
