The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesaler, so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be cracked back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I think that is really very angry.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it's also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in proportion.
Let's take a look, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of their own child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for a short period of time alone and it's okay for him, it's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while sleeping.
Just legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement also comes.
Because if something actually happened like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Krimi/Thriller a few years ago, and I can still remember almost the whole story, but the title partout doesn't want to come into my mind maybe someone knows...
The story was about fear and to treat it.
At the beginning of history, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overburdening himself with food and walking to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, runs a hospital where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little cousin who also has a fear (of fire) and who ends up with this therapist.
It comes to more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go and document the place of the selbs murder and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist conducts some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a center of anxiety in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another rides with intent on death)
This fear is referred to as the "fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this act is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wlan available.
I've got to contact my husband first.
That can take some time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back ?
Child, 4 years old, divider under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has wood fragments under the thumb nail over the entire length (outside).
Trying to pull him with a pinzette.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
I'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance refresher vaccination
Always new Omikron cases attract politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualified adults in England are therefore to receive a vaccination offer.
London - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead even faster in the Corona refresher vaccinations, given the rapid increase in Omikron numbers than previously wanted.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns also in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, an emergency has to be faced, which is why the protection of the vaccine must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased with a third dose.
"Let's get angry now," said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, thus increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the day before, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price for collection?
I am in favour of all of them showing up with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to an e-mail call.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I've looked at him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to stand by.
Conclusion: everyone should present himself with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today is not going
Obviously, the chair had an unobserved lack of sales.
How can a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
It's been working since about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to order and bill it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) have more frequent contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nights at me and unfortunately is far too common is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I'm quite sure we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are less things in my profession that move me more than I can do in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far away from viewing and listening I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of evading the children from it.
Whatever I would like to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series say about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two season already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said "We still have some anger in the belly" with the look back at the Pokal defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October.
However, it did not lie down after the game - but once again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
While more than the naked result disappointed the way of the appearance.
Substituting is a statistics that expresses the entire dilemma: The Trier-Quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer John Patrick said: "We were just not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and didn't implement what we trained."
It's like moving the ball.
Quite differently, his counterpart to Sebastian Gleim responded: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were admitted on Saturday at the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim still praised.
While Patrick's team itself failed the performance leaders such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already left 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, much time for the Habern won't remain.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all claims for warranty have been rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have so rewritten them.
We initially reported half a year ago.
Always as out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the go with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing going to happen.
The planned concert was relocated in May 2022 - "on instructions" to control the Corona virus.
Other of his appearances planned during the Advent period must first fall out, as it is called on the singer's website, which is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists want to catch up their appointments already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and gladly as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with commuting.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of strokes and Chansons in the style of the Median Harmonists.
He was awarded prizes many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For Women This Is Not a Problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair is strictly combed back and on labeled, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as required in Berlin in a referendum.
"With an expropriation there is no single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private owners, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Greens and Left Party intends to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the popular divorce.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz's discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition did not exclude any further deterioration in rental rights.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market is not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead through Tornados in Kentucky
In the event of a devastating storm system, numerous Tornados have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be complained.
The pictures from there remind a war area.
During the night on Saturday in the USA, several Tornados have caused severe devastations and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind a sneezing of the waste about 320 kilometres long, especially in the member state of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster zone, the Governor Andy Beshear said everything was gone, wherever the Tornado rang through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
It calculates only in the member state Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official figures rise hourly.
Hi, I just saw that she's sold out a display display. #NAME#
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or has it been taken out of the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display in another country?
Until when do you log in?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or returned through the contact form and wanted to ask if this was coming or being processed, since I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising terms
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees funds for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to vaccinations with Corona.
He changed to a company over which he was bothering.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not fasten in his old spot and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Helping in the first campaign of your own
Boron to the grass!
I am currently leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends Over the gripping pass and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the single file designed and now I am writing the entrance adventure and already stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a mill with grain from Gratfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
There the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of Goblins are supposed to listen to the heroes and lure them into ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening to recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the player.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In case of non-noticing, the Goblins are looking up the hero in a hollow path and flanking three to the left and right of the bows armed the movement while two with spears stop the movement.
Should it come to the battle and be subject to the heroes, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-and-half shall come in with two of his servants, and shall come to the mighty man's aid in the battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to enter the adventure?
The Goblins group will continue to play a decisive role, so it is not only cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially with so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to share many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I've built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then have the backlights to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has dropped more and more, so that I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was broken down in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 report on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably didn't have a choice here.
Nevertheless stupid, especially since Sky UK has won the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was again regular uncertainty with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag one could change the tires.
Although there was already this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came first to the conclusion that stalwarting may change tires when there were corresponding radio calls on Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility of getting lost.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 when you pay a TV.
Nor is it the first puzzle guess, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally not liked with the chosen comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant aberrations that make both simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with (even unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a great deal of unrest to the comment he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising as you can listen to F1TV as only the German ton track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very needy and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station that transfers the F1.
Unironisch makes RTL a better job in the four races, which they still have to transfer.
In any case, the grand F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# Pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and I haven't done anything so far.
The First Lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Aerial pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants from us.
At the end of the offer, look into the table.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable to connect more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump but also offer to place an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find in the shop with us) or with a décor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be to call a treasure rest, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an ausstromer, etc.... and it can start already.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level one should put a return valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards, which the water runs through the pump through the pool...
If the fan pump is applied outdoors, you, like other air pumps, should be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages will be packed daily and the packages will be picked up every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is agreed, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding of all the staff who also work in the shipping industry... of course there is no corona here.
Please don't judge equally badly, just because the delivery delayes, that's exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to beg about these services, even if we're saying... they're fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of Texas State.
In a radiant blue sky, Bezos received the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out and embraced the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Michael Strahan, a Nasa astronaut, who flew into space in 1961, was named the rocket system of Blue Origin (1923-1998), and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan, who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard on his operations and had to do everything himself.
She just flew with her, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres of altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object stopped from landing from large parasols again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres across the globe as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out from Blue Origin: At the first in July Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy director of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.

Someone who has been working in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory do not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also, before studying, had been informed about professional prospects at the time but also thought that I wanted to study and become a doctor.
At the moment, however, I am in doubt, especially depressingly looking at my job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one hears always super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand one hears again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested in this:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / content?
3) What have you studied/what training have you done?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and may consider breaking up the study in 2022 and making an education as a specialist in informatics.
If you have experiences there they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekend
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a post now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also those before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, Mariä was Assumption, which is called "Auffahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses are making a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So, what was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter e-mails, who absolutely must have been out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *without a doubt* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "Next week" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed to be?
Or because people want to spend as much on all serious things in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very powerful.
What is this self-restraint about holidays?
What else do we have holidays if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite so self-evident.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts at all.
"The beautiful thing, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the feast by bake and tickle with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But she has a few things to do up to the time of my life: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get rid of now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouse and the rejuvenation of the feather.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the poultry damage occurring in the bird husbandry is due solely to food errors.
Since the feather is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is essential for the formation of an impeccable spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin product should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR manual model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schleswig and Central Germany, the very rare Lok probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway driver ME Heft 11/1968, used with traces of play and defects see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal tracks in the Schleswign network, possibly also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we work on
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive which could transport on this route 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined on delivery as 1 1stCo+Co1' locomotive with Tact bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens jewelry plants with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928 the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In Dessau Reichsbahnbewertungswerk, the reworkability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] In 1959, when the continued re-electrification of the central German network showed an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service, three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were built up.
Only when the E 94 was allowed to see that the processing number could not be increased further, did the E 95 get to the point of view of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were mainly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complicated control of locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was often so that shooters remained stuck in switching handles.
Then on this locomotive the beeman with hammer and wooden bowl had to solve the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the motors occurred more often and resulted in months of losses in locomotives.
[5] Since there were sufficient new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could refrain from old locomotives and most of the splitter holes, so that the E 95 were not served.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocotives only once again, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were placed in mid-1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which on 5 October 1970 quit the service.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Up to the E 95 02, all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a ground heating system on the main station Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external reprocessing of locomotives began with the aim of being able to present them to a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995, employees of the tradition community Bw Hall P have been working on the operational revision of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotives were presented for the first time as an exhibition at the Museum Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paint, with the transformers being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in operation until 1945 on the Schleswig mountain railway and the branching sideways, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were moved to Leipzig to become the central German network.
The main area of use was, first, Silesia.
Handiwork model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical rework on the lok in own work necessary, dusted, with play traces, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual work model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can contain labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were some problems.
The central beam is held by two feet..leider are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately they are incorrectly produced.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent away?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right form of they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Main thing they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I get this?
Hello #NAME# Do you want me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area arose, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were hospitalised with slight smoking poisonings on Sunday.
The exact fire cause was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will arrive a long time later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To evade Fake-News - Biontech-CEO publishes Vaccination photo
Uğur  ahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur .ahin had so far not publicly expressed himself to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to tell  ahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur  ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media, there was misinformation that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote  in a post on Friday in the "LinkedIn" network.
"For a few months friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because communication should not turn around for himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a constipation device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often aroused by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle circulates, in which Uğur ,ahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself made clear.
"I am currently not permitted to get the vaccine itself," said .ahin.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in respanning plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
The light went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had paralysed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to come out for about 24 hours without electricity.
The fire caused the lights to go out on Friday evenings to 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The provider West Netz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power stations were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Fire fighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the persons concerned for their patience and assistance.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the circle, the fire brigades and the THW for the tireless use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to make use of the West Netz Mounts, since at first the West Netz-Monteurs could only temporarily re-operate some lines, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Current loops again
The fire broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m., according to West Netz, damaged parts of the 10,000-volt shift system in the Neunkirchen-Selscheid conversion station.
There is a need for elaborate cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neuekirchen-Selscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 a.m.
Since 11.15 p.m. the last electricity affected by the failure has also been involved.
More than 80 assembly lines from West Netz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It's important now that the citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and share them with the local fire brigade units when needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the setting up and operation of emergency power stations, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were mainly in the focus.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in Euro?
It's the daydeck #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are 3 explanations of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it in one another and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, otherwise she wouldn't be suitable for the purpose.
I'd like to have a feedback.
Yes, that's really easier!
That's how we do it!
You'll send me the return ticket by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We do not agree to that.
Nordic Combination: Combine Riiber Wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have been printed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to give himself to the outstanding Norweger Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a great lead after ski jumping into the trail.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we've both made it new and use version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems many times.
Directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect report it to customer service.
As far as I can detect it, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between, too!
To ensure that the colour order becomes uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the line.
A slight overlap of the paint layers ensures a uniform surface later on.
Avoid wiping with the brush quickly.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, when mixed with normal colors, it can come to unbeautiful metal sluices.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
The models reach the original true appearance through the decals or decals.
From sovereignty signs on airplanes to ship names to candlesticks and car models: The decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the Decals in the correct order as long as the components can be reached well.
An airplane cockpit is easier or easier to stick before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool, such as shears, pints and toothpicks, are when it comes to time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out every decal needed individually and put it right.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisturize their back with water for a short time until the support paper gets dark through the wets.
Then just push the picture a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you also moisturized before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, remove the support paper on the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, kneels or even rips.
Absorbed excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 single packages
Thanks a lot anyway!
then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
But do I get this back without problems?
Child wish treatment in PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child's wish treatment for some time now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly crosss.
According to the following series:
We had applied for the child's wish in advance at the PKV and had the promise of 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) attempts, but they did not calculate with the PKV yet.
We again requested the cost takeover at the PKV and received another 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have performed more trials than promised, logically count the most expensive with the PKV) we filed the bills with the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child's wish was a new insurance case.
According to the GTC, however, "The insurance case begins with the cure, it ends when treatment need is no longer required."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have indicated in the commitments that the further attempts with one birth should be made?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how I can get them back to the best
All right.
We won't order anything more with them.
When they add sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They may forward this to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was made and now you tell me that I have to send back the thing.
I don't know anything about the commode coming to me completely disturbed.
In the screenshot, please see what the colleague wrote.
There is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I have still not received a refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless of that, the 24 month guarantee shall apply.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I'm going to be able to cut off the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are applied for with additional Hockers to be purchased, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can she help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is precise, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of listings of low-budget films, such as letterboxed.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And you don't like what at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Would you like to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you need to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Heavy victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not continue to resolve the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels itself as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not take decisive action against it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it can't be implemented when a Member State puts itself in the head of making its thing", like current Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy would be difficult, as the line "Grand Protection, Border Protection, Border Protection" had been strengthened.
New attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have now again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the Authority on Sunday.
In the event of the incident, Polish officials had been rejected by the migrants with stones near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be supplied medically by a military doctor.
In total, border guards registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukashenko to have attracted her to the prospect of entering the EU as a powerist in Minsk.
According to the border sections, Poland and Lithuania opened press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has put its market power in the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough tapes and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take internal policy costs into account.
Belarus's society is probably not prepared to have thousands of people smuggled through the country regularly.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finals
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula 1 final, Mercedes filed opposition.
The silver arrows are thought to have two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is supposed to have been out of control.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
After Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton had taken over in Mercedes and was caught up with his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had taken over driving before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again
Thanks for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" series, author Judith Hermann on Friday read the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question was answered.
It doesn't everyone have the time for your stuffed chat and misdelivered cheapware from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all of us.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had thought yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemit that doesn't mean anything.
That's like when an afdler says he's got nothing against foreigners.
Both of you will not admit it.
But Colleagues constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then, you're not as serious as Colleagueah.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely loosened.
For my part, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bit of nonsense.
And with that you are a scientific enemy and not to take more seriously like Colleague
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnification should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanmatic achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnification and colour-free use of the magnifier up to the edge zone.
Luppies are often marked with magnification.
However, these data are only valid for precisely defined conditions that rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to be able to make optimal use of your magnifier, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in the case of stoppers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less visible.
Further information can be found in the instructions for use (in German and English).

I have already reported to you under customer contact with #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called before.

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation when he sells his tons.
One time even without his partner, a man should have gone home because both could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces for that purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situation.
He says that the pre-Christmas season always makes a bit funny.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a faulty delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have any discussion here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spear.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which sounds far less delicious.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbits flawlessly until a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, as well.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer comes the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes to (so use a socket which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fiber so much internet speed over the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely complex to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that peace would be with the Girokonts for the first time, sees himself deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to let themselves be confirmed by their customers with all kinds of tricks the fees increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a border of 100,000 euros.
Now she's half the money and even quartered the money for the day.
In a first step, the limit was lowered for customers of the Postbank Group Party only - to 50,000 euros at Giro and Investment accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower amounts are now applicable to the Deutsche Bank as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a threshold of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as to ING Germany.
The DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the free payments in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25.000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an amount of EUR 25,000 or less, according to the figures of the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparta Bank Berlin also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have even been entitled to this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
Now it is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions might have to make provisions - in the event that even the upper bodies explain negative interest rates in principle for inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be paid back.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of those for 6 persons.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made the "Friends" reunification and continued their series "The Morning Show" Furore in 2021, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston says, they enjoy a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that the hearts of the female and male fans are equally attached to you.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with the luck - and still looks for the great love.
And deleted the baby's wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
She was hurt.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really infringing.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkannen must give up
Kimi Räikkönens's departure from Formula 1 was even less than intended.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled off the gloves and wiped out the sweat of the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight band crossing, Räikkönen did not have to drop his Alfa Romeo after half of the race distance at the Grand Prize of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the win of the 2007 World Cup in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times by the Pole and came 103 times on stage. dpa
Friedrich brings 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the Two-Bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjöndal with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I guessed this once, I would have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double olympician of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the race in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he rejected Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out with a larger lead on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he went ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have been at greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to rank five this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilenbach finished eighth in the first race.
"If I knew what else he was doing, I would do it," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season in the two-erbob on her home track.
After it was enough for the fourth place in the monobob on the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory on Sunday with the German triple success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi.
Two-erbob olympicist Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, to rank two.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first pedestal in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first World Cup pedestal, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super happy with development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, stressing: "It's not just a move, but there's a lot to do here too."
Jamanka was a little angry with the not quite flawless rides, but said, "It goes right in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't solve why I finally asked.
Last year I had quite different problems with Corona and never time for that.
And now it's called he's gone down what's really exasperating me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is reduced :)
Why does shipping not start until 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I get to tippe an extra field with the message
Your colleague was taken away yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I've also sent you pictures of the misdelivery ware.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, just this week, until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe it's one - or another...
I'm 24, got kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has taken a burn 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see him and feel, we have been cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in the association wg incinerator).
He's cooled up here and we're looking at less (1-2x week) that makes me very good with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache right now, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has been a little relaxed after I was there with the heat lamp and stroke for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's gone for a month.
Now we are also going to have homework, which we are, of course, sharing.
But cooking itself is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine, I'm half well treated and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm right, and I'm almost symptom free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 a.m. I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and about tomorrow anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what's coming is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then we have a weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just till weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these spiritual clues, because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Thank you so much, I can't put that in words at all.
Don't know if I'd otherwise survived my kptbs.
I think that also has a lot to do with Mental Load of women, and that's why I thought I'd probably find me suffering friends here...
I wish you one more relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have today my order unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has impression.
At first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Let's say something completely different: I found in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, that was always something strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How's that?
Perhaps you can also tell different attitudes from workmates and students.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if it just seemed strange to have a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, does one want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Remember culture or something?
Hope you have a question that's not too private.
Can't change it or not?Write English that I also understand well
It's been a very long time, and I'd take a look at it.
It's all right, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Video search Help please
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (by 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I cannot describe it anyhow in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this kingdom in order to live himself I mean.
The transition is, I think, the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more lasting than you think.
Make sure everything is right, not cuddly animals, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Or is it with the face forward Directly in the mattress?
That's what you can say if everything's okay.
We have all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was a gang and would have to put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hi, I wrote with a colleague from you last night, and I haven't received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To say it quite clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station is now under all sue.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a large bedding tour.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet channel.
Citation Arno: You don't want to be "no running lithographic column".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertising station who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Those of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult people.
A crugman who lacks empathy completely and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to do all this well?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a lockout because my delivered wooden table was misplaced.
Corruption by damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in abdominal pain or just for cuddling – My small warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home agent for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and doze again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is only suitable for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow for untypical smell, stick or fire stains and immediately dispose of when present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the reference before!
Heat in a microwave with a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note information from the microwave manufacturer!)
Just after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by bulking.
Then put the inner cushion in the context.
The first warming can lead to light moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind the heating instructions indicated, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for fitness for babies (max. 43 °C) at your wrist!
Do not use pillowing in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disease and pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to administration.
Should sewing have opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies below 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after second series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Football League.
Hannover 96 now works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it doesn't work under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
This I bought about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Misrecognition, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore despite plug-in power supply.
That's what I've done, but there's nothing going on here.
Will you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With Peak Design’s Everyday V2 backpack no problem!
20 litres of capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on Version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has literally in itself - with the Everyday backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing easy access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proved itself at the messenger bag.
In this case, a metal cap hook with matching anchor beams is located at the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fills": there are 4 anchor beams, stablely destroyed, in which the closure hook can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Clasp closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without cracking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to feel the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the daily comfort of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus both easily store each other separately - and also independently through the two lateral openings.
In this way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment at the right main, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and don't get in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjustable straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# has emailed me yesterday for the assignment of the
Contact by the forwarding to collect the misdelivered table announced.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I'm writing with the third support employee now, I didn't get any more than a promise that I'm receiving an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the misdelivery custom #NAME#
It is to be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Would you like a nice evening?
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.
And that last year was different from thought I couldn't imagine and I just couldn't solve it on time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of brakes even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then processed mechanically (dried and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are their own for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at the elimination of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tinted discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake solders.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and solved the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest growing and flourishing cities.
Areas were closed down, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to exceed your pioneer colleagues not to go with the rest of them Pleite.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You select your actions simultaneously, need to budget with your resources and build a Tableau which works for you more and more (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or apply rules to your benefit.
With these buildings and dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official state status).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a location secretly and simultaneously on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players carry out alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening up shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the laureate turns into a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues for a long time until the laureate has moved five times, so each location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from a robbery of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolving heroes and the bandits are superior in numbers, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is happy to be seen in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patient: women and educators now raise severe accusations against him.
Please watch out, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones must never, never, ever, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the frame for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holechek: Countries advise on the absence of the test requirement for triple vaccines
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a country-wide absence of the test requirement for three-fold vaccination.
"We need countries to clarify quickly whether and from when for three times vaccinations can avoid the test obligation," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination," said Holechek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference on this as early as Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I do that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't take over my #PRS_ORG# anymore.
Advertisement: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping goes through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this be of?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anaesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to listening to sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Imperial cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of Awareness, as a very deep anesthetic is avoided for the protection of the child until it becomes navigable.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anesthesiology.
Certain anaesthesia methods such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, however** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Read your comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ don't help us either.
These are legal claims for warranty.
The absolute minimum would be to take the broken chair back.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they will at least take back the broken chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
That's where we lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice is that the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I was just calling there.
They told me that they were only on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not calling?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an instructor.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shaking diarium of a slow departure from the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I've been witnessing my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europelets, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPOL
According to data from Statistics Austria in Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in 2020.
The value of production amounted to more than 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year, is not collected
New York's first MLS Championship
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to finish the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
In the finale of the Eastern Conference, New York had taken a stand against Philadelphia Union, the team of the Deutsche Kai Wagner.
Raw tips & tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook to New Year's Eve for the first time.
I'll start a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'll get that to you.
IES is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18 January that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not come to me.
I'd like you to check it out.
Where Lübeck still has Christmas breams in the room
For many people geans or ducks belong to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is getting short.
We'll tell you where Lübeck is coming from.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and on the other hand the cracking content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up, it sounded like you can even flotate a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it goes out loud.
The full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
This signal is handled with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you want to give yourself a VFS5 footer, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tape" the pace of the compatible effects behind it.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step in the future!
But this was the case with others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the commode?
Do we get another update for the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If it's not possible, I'd be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are then a little much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in the negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the revitalisation of the international nuclear agreement are progressing according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to focus on some of the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there has not even been an agreement on the issues to be dealt with.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revitalize the agreement continued after just one week of interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia take part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overcast Saxony - Free State now Federal State with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
The only federal state in Thuringia has been located at the Corona Inzidence on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which at last always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with infection were reported in Thuringia.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
Report delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, health offices have been overloaded for weeks and with the recording of new cases hardly any longer.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only done at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and hand it over to the mail, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/apply/complete here any more?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for change
###Mbundestag are welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Monday, you can find one thing: it's not extensive.
We have come to a winter arrest and have expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this is simply related to dissatisfaction, how some things have passed here, and how we are generally represented.
In the last few days, the impression has been that many people here really still have bock on the afternoon.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the afternoon, which wants to keep it alive.
The incentive came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found one, simply saying, shrapnel piles.
After some writing and writing, several people from the community have found themselves happy to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project be existing in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the anniversary work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, which is not bad, we end up having the discord.
If you have a desire and time, come on the discord, work with you and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobby for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is there also in excess, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to let that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but as far as possible I will remove the cabinet for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to agree on a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, at the moment probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years earlier.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without thinking much.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I also support animal torture.
Therefore, my decision to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she felt disgust, then she defended vegetarianism, and said she knew where her flesh came from, and how to reduce it as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you'll quickly be put into a corner as a vegan and come up with conflicts, without which you'd put it on it.
It greets a harmonious Venetian (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exclude you from the legal requirements for remote handling.
I'm on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my returns on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, unfortunately this can't be changed either.
May I be assigned an alternative pick-up.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly back to work.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water recovery: 45.000 Euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Phelz interior minister Roger Lebentz at Lahnsteiner Rathaus gave a grant decision of 45.000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us here," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The trailer is used by the Lahnstein Diversafel, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice saving as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you can count permanently on rising operations: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could read only 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed up with her recommendations synced, removed, and the app reloaded NOT works.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here for the first time, I also spent nearly a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we also said we were weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into it further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the minister comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, the fact that these people can, of course, be difficult to deal with the living reality in particular uniforms and weapons carriers, to the right of conservatively attract people, should also be clear to everyone that these people can then, of course, be difficult to deal with the living reality, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white one, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not mean the excessive feminine clichés too, because these are in the executive rather less than at all but quite normal men and women who are not noticed if they can't tell you) and also those people and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they save your life or set this for you.
But also these margin groups represent even if for the first time it sounds strangely like a conservative attitude, my experience is proud of Germany, and they feel less affected by excessive left-wing politics, even though this policy is supposed to work for them or to make it right for them, in doing so they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the Right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forged any state-damaging plans is medially outright exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, it is true that police and soldiers who have often been in foreign work often started to standardize because of negative experiences and even say things are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also occurs that certainly even right comrades meet who carry on a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I think that something that is well fought is also being done against the whole with political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good so I think that we could not afford to have right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, I don't understand. I ordered the other basket on the German side as well.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to love with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Schwarz still to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But on the top of the edge of the wood are two deep candles, which were filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a little scratch
Oriental through child?
Hello, I'm (w32) busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but for my life I get it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and neat.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I space up and clean.
But it's never really that 'someone could come to visit spontaneously.'
My husband isn't better either, but most of the time I'm disturbed by a household that just loses it against work and unluckiness.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now for my question, did you manage to get better with child?
We don't have any work yet but we've been working on it and I've been busy with this question for a long time.
Because I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit comes and for example there is always fresh clothing there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or are you sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high quality, as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and I have been learning about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am becoming more and more aware that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time now about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means grossly that I have no sense of self-esteem and therefore I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people at the relevant level, but I find it very difficult to have a calm conversation and I have been told more often that I am acting inaugurally (where I think that has already become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, search advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the concrete working day really is the way I introduce it, and it's difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EPPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotional) because every time I have something to say about my code (the simplest things that I'm dealing with), I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should know how this is going on"/"I think it is with my stupid questions from the work"/"who really has to hold me under-medied" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in place.
But you've already held back the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean, give it back!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# will not be authorised by this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) taken with the food decomposes the bird into the individual protein materials (amino acids) in its stomach-darm tract and builds up its own proteins, which it also needs to form a feather.
The vein formation of the nestling and the re-formation of the mushering bird are extremely complex processes and the animal's entire organism is associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disorders in bruising.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, it is necessary to return to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation).

It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/wine feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A deleted measuring spoon (inbound) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
The double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given at the beginning in case of strong feather damage until the approach to feather reformation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is measured until the vein is fully reformed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair go broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and that pictures have been attached.

Statement of a municipal worker in the opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be enjoyed on our property.
So you have filed your application to the community.
An employee tells me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnuts are explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Eil message: serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently a major traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between Zelb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm currently reports (14:03 p.m.), a passenger car has arrived in the on-the-spot traffic while overcoming.
There's a injured man.
Ah, okay.
All right, thank you so much again, that it was so easy!
Counsel and ideas on further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, mildly good because my dear head is just disintegrating everything you can think about.
Before I get out of here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a rainlifter.
I originally studied something else and also worked there (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise).
But this was too boring for me, and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
Someday I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it was - even if the conditions were much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year around.
I have always decided to continue with the painting before and at least to end the ref, after that I can still reverse.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm totally out of my mind.
Now are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also bother me.
In principle it is fun and from the outside the ref also runs well as regards the feedback and so on.
But I'm totally out of my mind and I wonder how much stress my body can last before he's completely closed - if he doesn't do that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and though the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and together in a team which worked out what, and not as a single fighter like that now is the most time.
But then I wonder if in one year I did not return to the same place as now and be dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of crazy, but maybe you've come out as an outside advice or ideas, like I'm completely finished from this situation, and almost at the smallest thought of crying on it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas - that's enough for me for the first time already.
Thank you for reading and apologizing to the wretched undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, with which the behaviour of a tube amplifier is perfectly trained.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we present a brand-new modeling engine, which is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances are only so sprayed.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which anno in 2010 has once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series – with more dynamic and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum variety of sounds here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a bold sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determined the tube character of a amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.

The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individually plazier- and foldable Velcro-closing devices it is perfectly suited to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Greater DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store lots of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras by Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for other things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano outbreak on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of Tehuya volcano was in 1585 with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on past outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, volcanologists continued to dare not predict when it could end.
Indicators indicate slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
Changes in the number of millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the over 1,000-degree lava has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, the cooled lava created two new lands with a size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, the important banana cultivation of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly was seriously affected and which was already in the crisis prior to the volcanic outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the cracking tension a little seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional events that our increasingly divided society still holds together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Muss, was a peace-building "society treaty of natural peoples", can be removed from the rigid routine and replenished in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants by which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously on Nikolaustag, gifts were presented in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of giving, Germany’s popular custom of filling the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants voted at this custom because they reject intermediation between God and man as "sacred worship".
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of Nicholas and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the gift shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as this closely, it only exasperates the very least that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like Martin's use of Martinssingen and Martin's move, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought-after luxury watches, everything the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources demonstrate a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the lands of the Christian world, however, there is a joyful cult on the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears at the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned by time.
This includes, for example, his white routing beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, its sleds drawn from reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch befana that should have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fables sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some glory.
Here they are not reindeer, but three horses who, as a troika, pull his sleds.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police informed that callers had reported a man who had gone with a gun to a bank and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled according to information from the authorities in a vehicle that could not be stopped by officials much later.
It would have been a good shot and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easily set up and can be embedded in the ground with 2 earth-spouts.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous life max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly dangerous objects from distant galaxies, which are intertwined in colour.
It is quite harmless, however, for »Smart Stone«: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different shades of colour).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself every day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He does well also in the neighborhood of larger gravel and findlings, where he knows how to claim thanks to his size.
You can save yourself great preliminary work: As a solar lamp »Smart Stone« requires neither supply nor batteries.
Place the »light stone« in any place, tags from the sun.
Two earth-spouts supplied provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawning, »Smart Stone« starts to shine by itself; in what color you define yourself: Six attractive light colours are available to you – besides daylight white.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery load level has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the front on the next day.
I've done that several times. It doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will not order on principle anymore.
If you think differently, let me know.
Otherwise, this was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

Pill Problem
Hello dear female people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shitting PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to leave that again because I've already had enough medication to choose from due to chronic diseases.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two years' break I had got from 0 to 100 explosion-like picks and these everywhere.
As far as that surface is concerned, but I've done it pretty well, and I don't feel comfortable.
In the two years' break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this once.
Perfume-free and without gedöns is already my cosmetics, but maybe there's what someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, female doctor has not taken me so seriously and skin doctor appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Pre-buppertary had bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale constipation and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me have construction site everywhere you don't want to go looking any more for what else is wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my question.
I always have to work and go to the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
However, there is a large number of them in general.

110 kV ground cable is being rebuilt 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation to the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the free line.

This is a glass commode and the entire pages are set up, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
Commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that commode can't be picked up because no one's allowed to enter my apartment
Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the question is #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I've still got big problems to plan my teaching time-efficient in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped so I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for Earth) at school.
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the issue of geofactors, and I am actually standing for every hour.
In principle, the methods are repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I always go out of the learning goal when planning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I'm rather dissatisfied.
The working papers are therefore also available.
Maybe I can even be a geography teacher how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to start the return for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regime.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or cured may be allowed to do so.
Trade believes this is unnecessary and complains about sales interruptions.
It also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations destroy the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In the case of transactions involving articles of non-day needs, sales breaks should be filed, criticised HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What actually should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis rates in the last week.
It runs well only in the food retail as well as in the online field.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business manager.
"2G while shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel use.
He called for the banning scheme to be approved on a national level.
After that, each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all shops with the bank received on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retailing, as already in public transport at the 3G regime (vaccinated, cured or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were lastly without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safe in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Officer Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, efforts are made for the Center to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called "Bändchensolution", where "the visitors, for example, at a central location in the center, can get their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - can enter undisputed all shops". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake that has been tried with a yellow filler to be cashed.
That looks unbeautiful.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it into the package and stuck it in.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range from 3100 to 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp creates a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set and on the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User Memory The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply press one of the memory keys and complete.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when the lamp is switched off, so that the known situation is restored when the new one is turned on - very practical in studio work when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with installed - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left-hand battery top display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply electricity continuously to the headlight over the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm case for mounting as a connection, so you can directly reach your phototabe.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of fixtures on both sides.
It was taken care that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a joint is included in delivery.
Great is that also a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
It's a shame I got and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Beat": Frankfurt celebrates after torturing Comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in series were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga track.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration of a full season start from the soul and won forrios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today", coach Oliver Glasner shouted at DAZN and spoke out a "Pauschal-Lob, to everyone who was with them".
At the beginning it looked like a new damper for the now in rank nine behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," says Glasner.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Christopher Lenz, who for the first time had been able to stand again in the place since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a look at the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to shoot today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the future tasks, but he also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top match.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "step forward step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "through this level until the turn of the year".
Next, an outing game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hrs, Sky) will be on the program as early as Wednesday in the course of the English week.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it wander, no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and give up the order again?
Unfortunately, it would mean that I will not be ordering again because it has taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women in front of quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneak after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup round, the DHB election in the 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers was a degenerating defeat and must now run against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game from everyone we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to get into the semifinals, a significant increase will have to take place against the 2019 World Championships on Tuesday to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Greiseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted reintroducer Xenia Smits and demanded: "We need to look forward quickly."
From front to rear not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height with the call.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4-return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was to win the DHB team for 9:30 minutes, when Greys successfully completed a quick counterturn.
However, this was not the expected initial inflammation.
The German women were hardly able to stage themselves against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was running at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since returnee Mia Zschocke saw red not much later because of a hard fouls on her opponent.
In the quarter final, however, she may participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time did the DHB selection get into play a little better and until the break came at least to five goals.
The only quiet hope of a hunt for the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greens were sinning in all areas and made it easy for the well-kept opponent who was one of the medal candidates during the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer achieve a performance increase and went from the parquet as a clear loser.

The title is that I am active as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (up to now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are soon to a large extent finished, it will continue to be part of vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medication X, that is due to vaccination").
In my field of responsibility, there is information about vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination according to Coronaimpfveordnung and no reasons to speak about it), the medical documentation and, where appropriate, emergency care for allergic reactions (mer never happens).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sakes no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, which cannot perform vaccinations (can?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR television broadcast "We in Bavaria" has provided for intense thought.
But unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unspeakable this time from the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "if everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg told the solution and thus probably also caused amazement in many upper valleys.
"The Huidler," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven."
The dialectist Antony Rowley, surveyed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typical supple term, somehow derived from the more well-known oral article "Hothers".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also with a number of people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation always comes the following error message: open - soming wins wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired to the PC.
Nothing helped.
The choice of tires on the racing bike really so pan-proof?
This morning I woke up full of action because I still wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I went off with my racing wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in so much city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass divider on the track.
Zack, loud cystic and my rear tyres didn't want to join the rest of the track anymore.
Because because of the weekdays I had no real way to get my replacement jacket and replacement hose, I had to turn back with half a bad mood and take the first train home.
Was not that bad at all then, perhaps it is better if I practice this with the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would get this problem very unpleasantly more often.
Now it was really not bad, as the old tires of the pre-owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike until 14:00 120km destroyed!) and who had already described it as suboptimal, because he has been on role with them for several years.
But if I think I have to do another tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly laughed :D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the platform who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be unflattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very seductive.
But are these really so uncapable?
I don't want to spend 40€/reef now, just to be disappointed.
I wonder: I'm on the racing bike right now, I think I'm 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) at Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me about other tires on a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Do lay knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car tossing against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was beaten against a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xante with his car for an unexplained cause and then got to the counter-train, as the police reported.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then dragged against a tree and the man crammed in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured during the accident and brought to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have all deleted books all bneu authorized and loaded new books

After the release of our new high-end wide band B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also receive young ones again.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly included to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
It has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but to soundly a very high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate nearly unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is noticeably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-tone rise.
This is common for wide bands in general to optimize the growing bundle of too high frequencies.
Directly oriented to the hearing place, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone area can be reduced slightly outwardly, thus making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the placement of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo-drieck is knife-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy nynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan corresponding changes in construction.
For example, if you want to burn the case, the reduction of the speaker has to be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable easily later on.
With the help of a upper milling mill, the speaker opening in the front is followed, so that the B 100-6 OHM can be used later on.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker’s assistant inside as large as possible.
The four coupling points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image 'Detail Phase'.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface.
On these the back wall, lid, front and floor are now brought up.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves may vary in the thickness of materials if necessary, for example, if you want to use finished performance from the building market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF itself.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
After that, all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forest drill, the opening of the bass reflex tube is facilitated, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Then you use a round miller to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base can also be rounded off.
The base plate is attached firmly to the foot of the housing and is additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-boring (2.5 mm drill) of the coupling points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (absuction / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The simplest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cables are pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is lead to the speaker opening and lets it hang out loosely there too.
The frequency soft is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency range, as well as the corresponding connecting plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency soft is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives onto the opening and thus lock.
Through the opening of the B 100-6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be solved at the plus-pol of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people to the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termness of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we're going to give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
If you've ever had drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
