What are they supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know the place of perfection, nor the "conditors".
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS at the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has once 'knocked off' members of the new Council from ČSSD, as they dominate the Norwegian Serpent, who has been incarcerated in recent years, where today's coalition partners in Prague were on rowing.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the fragrant era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is derived from some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils did something in the dark regarding the new terms.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm rather a newcomer in Prague's politics", Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatz".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded similarly.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you're presenting me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in June of this year before the ODS elections, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those which are notorically linked to the Prague Magistrat.
The S & Ds should define the terms "Voldemort", "Grandest Prager Golfloch", "Going into Konditorie", "Tiernacken", "Treason of the Capital" and "Blessing".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.
"These things don't matter to me and how civil democrats talk about each other, I don't judge."
"For me, it's important how we understand ourselves in our programs," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above would not have recognized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-Citizen Bém, Roman Janoušek, is speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing and the only term he correctly learned during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kucký, but added to the safety: "but I know that more about the newspaper."
And it's a joke: "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is not only deduced by Matador Karel Březina but also by the Councillor for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
Both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure is to be found and what it means to go into the pastry.
"I think that means going into some Praguen gastronomy," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In harmony with Březina, however, he is demanding to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
In fact, judging the test participants does not seem to give a similarly benevolent snake among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's no such thing here."
"We call on the name, back and forth, we also use fasting or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - named by his party comrades salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations at the party-sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spitznamen is the only one that allows the social democrats to use their language internally.
Hulínský doesn't seem to like it if you call him "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz recorded another nickname of Prague's chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knupple Rights" is said to have acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "hexes" and issued a brochure
Women, who are stamped in Burkina Faso as witches, usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are busy and have no children.
If one of these women "will" to the witch, it is strictly isolated so that it cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women will not be able to do this because they are helping and giving birth to children," explains a religious sister who cares for more than a hundred women in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And that's why he published a brochure to stop the "heaven tracking".
But the thing's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written Enlightenment.
The witchcraft, however, is also going on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they overthrew her with petroleum and just burned her on.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to its version, oil is flamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
And after the group tried to "eject" a bad spirit from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the gambian president himself has been well mixed up with the president.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, set up a showy witch hunt, as they supposedly had a share in their deaths and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He therefore called Shamane from nearby Guinea for help, who accompanied police, soldiers and the prison guard of the President's unrelentingly arrested women and men, and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai, in her report, led the Amnesty International organization.
On the farm, the incested people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused gut and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An older undersigned man leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty des "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a mappe with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is just making a prison sentence.
All three were just increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is expected to take a 2-room apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
"And there's not even hot water flowing in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he tipped with his finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signature he has an authority.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-confirmed and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, who described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just turning off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is thus becoming a major "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is in favour of most rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning breaking full on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"For 2011", a special touchscreen keyboard shines.
Shortly typed and already the device spits out a list of numbers.
We have hardly released the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to be the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and similar.
From the middle of November, the Kuverts and the new lease contracts in the region of Ostrava will be the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes an increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since November 18.
"The action is running a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies answer after the switch after a moment of delay when the "Client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalas former mining workers are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this subject quite openly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a nice toilet glasses they could change," the man mentioned at the outset gets air.
Up until now, employees are mainly in charge of pensioners on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount, which promises to them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The benefit of a half reduced February rent will also be the other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15th.
Until now, "deregulation switches" in Havířov are anything but overloaded by requests.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only 40 to 50 of the rent here in 2011 because of this," the switch officials appreciate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the lease parties do not agree on the new lease, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as an information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal practice," RPG explains on its websites.
"There's nobody going to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where I should take the money for a court fight," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Look at me."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they shouldn't sign and so the people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and RPG Byty says that the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not enough to maintain the residence fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's housing portfolio and - precisely the neglect of the apartment fund that has been criticised by the tenants is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the homes between 2005 and 2010, between 2005 and 2010, it should be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in Havířov's waiting room, a few red-lighting information will appear again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 amount to 15% and fewer of 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"All this means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square meter and month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increases the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push the rents to the height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenues from the increase in rent (see diagram) the company wants to re-enter the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and thermal insulation.
But, first of all, these are to benefit those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw one - to the office also belongs a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, whose studios come from a whole series of renowned Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company minichild garden.
In wise prospect, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby tree age and the company is committed to the project participants returning to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working abbreviatedly, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The civil engineers have made it easier to put their demanding profession and care for children under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Minikindergarten operational programme is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic State budget.
Thanks to this funding (CCC 2, 8 million grants), the necessary facilities and facilities were purchased and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and the operation is provided.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten 3 further years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the Economy Rating society providing strong assistance in the application processing process.
The children care fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day varies over several children each other.
The kindergarten business is flexiblely adapted to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although this is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children not only play here, especially they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What is more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can at any time take a look at the children and thus avoid the stress when the children pick up late from a faraway kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employers' relationships with employers.
Arch.Design joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when applying new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house is also fascinating after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric echo, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the locals, the house with its organic forms was given the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the shelling facades and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features for the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colours and textures reminiscent of nature and living creatures.
Only when we look at things more closely is it noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
During the night, the whole facade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same fluctuating lines and entangled shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even guckholes and ledges.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively Passeig de Grácia No. 43 shopping street was built by the conversion of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally consisted of the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudí's in an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
The house of Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also cooperated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the locals of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "nearing house".
It is also said that on top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for the house at that time.
A little bit of bizarr already mutates her 45 degree-new.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all construction regulations at that time and was by no means moved by these.
Before the construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he had provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when completed, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedial aid.
Among other things, the councillors also agreed that the construction with its pillars was even in the public side.
However, there were no more amendments, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city district's call for it, Josep Batlló made an application for authorization of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and she was given early.
The houseowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept to connect spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the lounge doors and thus a larger society could comfortably chat without having to give up a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors due to Gaudí's reconstruction, apart from a new facade.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is dressed and the Light Courts.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The houseowners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly easy-to-use business, the visits were maintained, yes, it was also extended to other shared rooms and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a cardboard handle, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist certificates get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon tower should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have different wishes than men
Not the great bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - thus mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these need to complement harmoniously in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattresses and rust have to be placed is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited as they need much longer to "be warm".
In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
After all, if they do not have enough ventilating canals in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is growing: it is therefore not excluded that it forms under their mold.
The choice of course also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Because all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"These include, among other things, those who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specialises in upholstery furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses, among others, offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it smears to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't wave around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection from dekubitus (Wundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size one should still add to the body size the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm width, i.e. 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cms are attached.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies for the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on the back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the headmaster of the upholstery and room equipment, who has been dedicated for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and who also presents this topic to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when buying so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else is left to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three inches should fall on the mold layer and the fine padded pad.
"With your hand or when you're put to death, you can't feel the feathers in any case," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully upholstered beds with mattresses and underlays such as grown Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the relation cannot be washed, what is already going on and what is going on today.
And since one loses sweat in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress is slowly becoming a huge (and stuffed sieve).
For this reason, professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a life span of up to 25 years, even life-long guarantees in mattresses.
Every thing has her when and But.
And therefore a practical advice from dealers: In the case of mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not hide the hygiene of the washable, pull-off covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually produced today with round-um tear closure so that you get two halves after opening (i.e. important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the uneven struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
They should also prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in there already) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine pad.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a document.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable latex and coconut combinations, with a larger number of lattices, which means 28 and more strips, with lattice support in the lumbar vortex area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
On adjustable lattices, no mattresses with spring skeletal are included, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fastening of the spring strips, which enables you to press the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
It's an important thing for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are ginned by these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point-plastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-plastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are determined.
Pressure is distributed on several points, thus reducing tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like for example.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the once filled straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their rinsings.
The new magic word "Bio" is also called "Bio" in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used for the production of polyurethane foams more and more frequent natural oils - for example ricnut and soy oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"In the case of mattresses whose core is made of materials of purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here too you make a difference between husband and wife.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract is used from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
And today's favourites?
Matratzen from cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than usual polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where head, hip and heel are located.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to be taken.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
The first Czech company to benefit from this advantage was Gumotex.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
On occasion there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze for 11.990 CZK with a brushed Visco foam memory.
The second one gets you free of charge.
It was the tempur material that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when heat is cool, in a cool environment, it strengthens itself in turn.
In this way it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as for special foot cushions, which are intended to facilitate legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for car consultation, can be as well located as people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a watch.
Many people have put the fall of the missing Anička in fear and horror, and thus they look for ways and means to protect their children better.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a matter of pioneering around the world, but of an effective means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS placement equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be abuse of such equipment in individual cases, for example if you put it in your pocket without him knowing about it, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "shaft" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that a child, if it doesn't like to wear such a thing, simply avoids it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, the mobile phones aroused great expectations, but they can be switched off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Bočková.
In their view, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper virtually always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used wider, they would also be looking for them, as their sales would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always one step ahead," the psychologist says.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the RC Monitoring company, offering location services for cars as well as for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a inclination knife is integrated, i.e. if one falls down and remains motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs a special software.
The problem of the current tracking devices is that this is either about devices in size matchboxes, which resemble trailers or about smaller phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, therefore, are testing in the present-day devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he doesn't realize this until after some time, what the police gives a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, always the same technology is used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of tracking function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap around the Czech Republic but only hold for two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of ignition cords, and are fired with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have been running out for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for lupish 40 million crowns.
In his reasons for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES answered that the soldiers would consume each year to the 60 kilometres of cord.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnicians who addressed MF DNES, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be half justified.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But they would also be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that the training of each new occupational soldier is sufficient for two meters of speed, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned, even from the point of view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't know why they're buying such a huge amount of ignition."
But that's their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as a dealer wish to meet widely," says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of cords with which the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year term of use of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"In case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
Once the duration of use has expired, every ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not at risk of the life of the soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, but they cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445-kilometre ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," says spokesperson Pejšek, telling us the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just to compare: The annual consumption of ignition cords by the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army, has been barely 1,500 metres in excess for a few years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can still consume before the end of their life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, it is also possible to keep flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords open.
The Ministry of Defense has already had huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition cords, which they bought "favourably" today.
To date, the contacts I've gained thanks to the competition are coming to me.
Lukáš Pytlun has helped to sell his hotel's franchise, winning placement in the competition "Small Businesser of the Year".
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year".
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation abroad and through a bank loan he created a building with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time made me angry and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then gradually converted to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has been able to open four pensions in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the 4-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Great share of this license sale for the business of hotels had the victory in the competition "Entertainees of the year", Mr. Pytloun adds acknowledgment.
The victory has brought him greater familiarity, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend to everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that to this day he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise it would not have happened at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is granted general recognition."
I really do not see this as just a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only been put to the fore," says Lukáš Pytlun modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first ranking of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year received Karel Ž,árský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury at that time appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to stamp a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only me, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the struggle with competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, efforts were made to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Ž,árský as a compensation for the property seized by the Communists a small workshop for the lease, he did not hesitate for a long time, left his career in the company where he was employed until then, sauced and founded his own company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only by success in the competition mentioned and its medialization has it entered into the consciousness of non-publicity.
"Not only did our customers see the Farmet brand more intensively now, but also our foreign partners began to work with a company that achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Ž, a member of the company.
The last year, however, was not only the sign of victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time was even less shaking the citizens, but especially companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We couldn't miss this situation either."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take redundancies," explains Karel Ž.árský
A viable company must sometimes also take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
The company was not willing to make cuts in investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation at international trade fairs and earned major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž.árský.
Everything proves that we've overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere", Karel Ž,árský says.
A question of opinion, which is irrational.
The poll on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the business competition.
Some senseless regulations have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called him by two clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the survey.
"In future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer demand extracts from the trade register in the case of social insurance payers' checks," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Bura, ová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under which entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to meet and remove the senseless.
This year, for the fourth time already, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Economic Newspaper (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder corporate activity.
"With regard, for example, to the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has 74th place in terms of the terms of the company, compared with the previous year.
The competition of the year was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense at the end of September from April until the end of the competition.
The website is used for the registration of the website www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition is looking for seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and has the public vote over the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
More than a hundred, more than 105 senseless regulations and regulations have already been notified to this year's poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and highways tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to provide every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at Wenceslasplatz in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and Commercials of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Wherever the state throws the entrepreneurs in between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year that are still unnecessarily making their businesses difficult today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to create senseless orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, the majority of the entrepreneurs were obliged to report three days in advance to the commercial office at the site of their permanent establishment to want to travel with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or to Kirmes.
This obligation was abolished due to a novella of the commercial law.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007, - the duty to report service travels to the employment office of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Map".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation, which it imposed physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation has been somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the fridge obligation has fallen away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A new feature of this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsive Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies who are aware of the consequences of their business on the environment and who support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of the Vodafon mobile phone company, who is the exclamator and warrant of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company, companies for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and kills enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about disabled people, for example, because personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the development of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also responsible for her health-retirement employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was honoured by the title "Responsive Company of the Central Bohemia Region", and in the competition of Vodafone Company of the year she took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week and without a proportionate wage reduction.
During the title ceremony, the jury also respected the fact that the company is mainly buying from Czech manufacturers, supporting citizens' initiatives in their environment and working according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment," explains their managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is located at the health of its employees and therefore it has bought them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, as well as promoting home work with its employees and using mapping services offered by a private protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in need", which gives specific help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We give our employees contributions to the catering, work path, to increase their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the Czasch building company from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The responsibility-conscious company of the year was automatically notified to all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year who answered the questions raised by the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the betting companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsive Company of the Year", but in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year they were not disqualified for that reason."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police in the last few days made arrests.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken by the detectives in handcuffs.
It was alleged to have tried to manipulate a current public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition had a specific interest.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person because of the crime of fraud at a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner Procuratorate of the newspaper "Právo", she cannot provide further details with regard to the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
The way he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the sparse official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá pointed out to the question raised by Právo that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not one of our employees," she concretely stated.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct term "Requirement for the submission of claims for transfer of land under the Landgesetz" and would take place in cases where several applicants have interest in the land offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared property value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is set, and the land fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the fund’s spokesman.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information, who had signed up for the request, and because he was himself a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Obviously against a greasy detachment.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Soilfonds Václav Sankota, who was persecuted by criminal law because he produced land in replacement restitutions to which location decisions had already been taken on construction projects.
At that time Luboš G. of the Landfonds acquired, for example, also plots intended for construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged this very cheaply with the magistrate against a house right in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give heavy heart to the small part of the building so that the construction project could not be threatened by the blockage of the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred months
From January onwards, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges and for district heating and some places will also increase rents.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet more than before.
Electricity becomes more expensive by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supplies, and some places also sell district heating supplies.
The housing budgets cost a few hundred crowns a year alone.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Gas becomes only slightly more expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too a few hundred crowns can be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Mainly larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns per month from January, more than 1,000 crowns pay more per year families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, and this in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the Prague price remains among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
An enormous increase in rental prices can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rentals, where the so-called rental regulation expires from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants judicial interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drinking with Fernet and rum beer is out - it seems easy too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, an unusually good whisky that you stole from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks that, after their enjoyment, drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep in their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly heavy alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department in the mid-Bohmic clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it's possible to take away a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who is taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief doctor Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admission have long been no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, on which he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatry Department of the Hospital of Motol, where the rescue cars supplied drunk students from near and distant.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years of age when she was first supplied with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase"," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home 48 hours," the chief doctor wondered.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when invading with their own offspring is regarded as one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, real dependence in the true sense of the word is not a matter of children.
"With alcoholism, a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all its related phenomena can be understood and this is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the speaker of the hospital, Motol, who is a hospital, was sent to the local Department for Children's and Youth Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases with severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by the parents after an outpatient treatment or, where appropriate, by the police, shall not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of schnaps in the school bench there are three seasonal amplitudes, according to which there is one hundred percent leave: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief because of bad testimony or because of joy on vacation."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has to fight only with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headache in the morning, which is due to dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be driven out in the hospital with a fluid-pending infusion of glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better at it, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without anything hurting."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, sometimes ruining the patient's good mood by counting on them the costs she will cost.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed come well and like a few thousand crowns.
"Hin and again, I used this as a means of education, when I calculated directly to the children at the visit, what their drunkenness has cost and that it can quite happen that they have to work all the vacations to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not intervene in regulatory proceedings to ask the parents for the necessary costs to heal the drunk children.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter planes L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, have flown to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been shown abroad at maneuvers or flight shows.
The two-seat version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army, is the subject of the flightable two-seat version L-159T1.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
When she is physically expeditioning the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
In turn, the L-159 single-sitting fighter aircraft was isolated from long-term lodged aircraft, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's premises.
"The double-sitting L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighters, as in May 2009 the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million treaty on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version with Aero Vodochody.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second wants to take over it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to implementing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the company is EADS carrier of aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to train pilots in NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's business in what way he realizes the thing," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defense had not written out a tendering procedure for purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she only used 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa may also have a judicial replay.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defense at the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a European invitation to tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land at the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer toe finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose toe finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously less likely to suffer from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This should be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this in particular in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health risks, added Mrs Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the toy finger was shorter in the right hand than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was true, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and toy fingers were equal in length.
In men whose toe finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-eight percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was fleetingly known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "fully proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snowdeck on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways is mostly fixed snow, the winter shifters were often on the road all night long.
The motorway D5 between 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague "is".
Novinky.CZ said this to the dispatriator of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometers 91, a truck crashed, at kilometers 93 two trucks met, and there are injured in this accident.
A few cars are also located in the street mooring.
There are also problems at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too two trucks have crashed.
The riders were to leave Brno at 190 kilometers or drive over Brno and drive to the village of Kývalka at kilometre 182.
There are kilometers of traffic jams.
An accident also happened on the D11 and that right on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a multiple centimetre thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolonnes form, for example, in the Prosek district, also the Štěrboholská street is completely clumsy.
The safest transport is definitely the Metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meets.
There are also problems at the railways and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow movements.
There are, for example, problems on the line Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia can only be driven with increased caution.
To Vyškov, three side roads are completely imperceptible, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snow movements and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Also here you will have to use snow milling for snow clearance.
When they become available again, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of white carpaths.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert scatters, there is a snow cover of up to five centimetres thick, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow, most in northern Bohemia, fell to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
But in the Czech Republic it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
For the first time in Afghanistan, the American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon, which is previously known only under their code-name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift its power relationship to their favors.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are guided by laser with a safety of only a few meters to the target.
The special shafts of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain high explosive explosives, operate practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point in their ballistic flight path not only during impact.
That means you can use it against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in the shelter.
He is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel divider rain from above can easily put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does so: he fishes the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"If you push it off, the gun will pick up and shoot the shot at distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
Relocated 400 jobs
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their work from the office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu shifts its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
One of Fujitsu’s spokespersons explained that in the medium term there should still be a further 100 jobs in the Group, which has been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park would be more likely to meet the working conditions of the employees.
Fujitsu was also just tenants in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment of the losers.
The Frankfurt Economics Department Markus Frank (CDU) said that a global player had been won again.
This is a "great commitment to location".
Fujitsu passed to the city, the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the Executive Board of the intention.
"We naturally offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed any of the problems of the computer manufacturer with the property owner at the Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have been the outcome.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will show up in cooperation."
The house used by Fujitsu at the town hall square and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were one of the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the other buildings at the Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city street was created between the railway station and the town hall, which provided criticism both for the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking lot and for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Chancesn Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concerts based in Tokyo are known as the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu counts in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving into Frankfurt-Netherlandsrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped floor plan - has its seat, among other things, the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronic Industry.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Amazon Internet service provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileak's founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol fastening lists, is supposed to stop after a UK newspaper report.
"Wikileaks forced out of Amazon's server."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the revelation activists announced by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic depths in order to handle the high number of access to the documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks explained the step: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers through Wikileaks, after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had researched, the television station CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to prevent use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, inescapable and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers the globe," said the partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks spread stolen material in his efforts."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched by the authorities in Sweden for rape suspicions, is on the list of interpol .
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australians in the UK stop, the exact place being Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks-Sprecher Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was right to fear his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is why the Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks envelopes be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant from head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of strokes.
The spokesperson of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughter and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently announced espionage demands to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of a guy's opinion with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
The White House was appointed as Special Representative of the Centre for Anti-Terror measures, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to allow us to check how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would care for the security of dissidents and the most active, should put them at risk by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said outsider Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if this is necessary."
Ice University
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice coming from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
The Gelatier, on the German side of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The Gelataio picks up the ice cream with a spatula, scrapes it in the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But if you want to know more about ice, you don't pass the Gelato University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has established the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also special courses around chocolate and internships in the on-site ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others simply venture into the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, California art teacher, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years wants to put something in a nervous job of his own.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro animals Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
It is not only good taste but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget when he is trained to get the cream of the national and even south-eastern superstructure: "Italyn Gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romanticism in it."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice varieties.
The lecturer is immediately concerned with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar core flour from the guarbons.
Of course you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it falls into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Some variations on the basic mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit division or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastries.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of aromatized additives on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow with eggs and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano produces four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice each - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the varieties of the fruit ice.
More aromatics, more fruit-puree - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Haselnut ice does not necessarily taste more nutritious when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlight the taste of an Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: if peach powder is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winters thus measure the eyelets in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the computer easier.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beat at the same time creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo cuckoos himself and his course colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit puree, when the overdimensional staff mixer gets him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like this happens."
On-screen controllers
The European Food Authority Efsa was underwent by the gene plant experimentation industry.
This proposal is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is seen as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had worked significantly on the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticised.
The Efsa rules are equivalent to the position papers of Ilsi and therefore the handwriting of the industry, which is intended to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech complains of a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager is recently appointed the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta, without any conditions or transition time, and has thus changed the pages.
The mid-German radio (MDR) had also recently revealed human links between EU authorities and industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU Parliamentarians bright.
However, the Efsa cannot identify any conflict of interest.
One goes back to all serious data, including industry as long as they are of high professional quality, it says in an opinion.
Of the experts working for Efsa, it is not required that they have no contacts with industry.
But you'd have to reveal it.
Kuiper is launching his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobby order.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes genetically modified maize on the field, for example," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how can you find them?" Then, asking Ann.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
As in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are, therefore, hardly any researchers who are not interconnected with companies.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got what, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood form Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the tuba on his back.
It was Demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the excavators were hit and had begun to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zigs were demonstrating against S21, the milliards of laying down the station.
When the construction stopped, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim musselkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a couple of broken ups.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't go away."
He swams: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the broken ones yet.
Stones have time.
So did Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground into Scots or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bundle that was once a watchhouse.
Instigated and threatened, he was told that in September he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if once it happened, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to be used again.
Some 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos heavy quadlers on average, with a unit price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to give him back during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from all over, and had tossed away what suitcases and followers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the stimuli have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into restrictions of herbal beds.
"This stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises in his off-road car, makes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
Jura studied and quit, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone merchants.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he brings together his treasures.
He says he's the largest Altstein dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow there are artificially carved sandstones.
"They were once part of the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, warm.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
Let's go.
"Beautiful Travertin."
The Quader were once part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion Tribune.
Everywhere in the snow Stones and Stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police President, red granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasia, Tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what welding.
If Rongen thinks about how the stones were previously cut by hand and moved with simple bottles of trains and ox carts, he will be very respectful.
"It would be a scandal if you were to scrape such a thing."
He hasn't become rich. He hasn't even been a stone-rich man.
But 14 people employ the stone merchant today, and have settled up in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasswinder and a garden builder.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the rest user.
In the near future, he must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Fight for High-Potentials
There's a real need for a buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon sandwiches, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Autobauer Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition for ideas, together with VW developers, they are supposed to get to know Volkswagen through the car of the future.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go to the close fight and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: recruiting the most gifted graduates in the hearing rooms as early as possible before coming to the labour market and being recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue statements about the achievements of their students, they try to find and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber tales and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and collect experience."
"VW can also get to know students, watch interesting candidates more closely, and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It's new that the students are so open-minded.
"At least the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduations will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
In particular, they must be priced, especially for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unscathed in October.
And the so-called engineering gap, according to VDI forecasts, will grow even bigger.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carcass, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States in this way next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone allowed to decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la Crème of the many candidates flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger in the hoods and stings around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to take the race out of the crowd."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For Talent hunter Dykta the bill seems to go up.
"We still have contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are just ahead of their conclusion and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to direct buhling on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also classified as being able to attend the Pirsch at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, Head of Staff at the Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the youth problem.
Currently 35 posts are registered on the company website.
"It's very difficult just to occupy positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors provide evidence that we can do internships or write his dissertation."
Expensive promotions are not announced by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large group can often not offer that," says Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, babysitting or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld finished 55th in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
In doing so, employees wonder how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also add to the job-seekers.
"I think candidates look especially at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase their authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads over your own employees," he says.
The internal employer branding is in the jargon industry, i.e. employers' branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you handle his people well and identify them with the company, then they would advertise for their employers only with friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
On the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has adopted a ban to this effect - and thus has finally withdrawn its earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains under ban.
Mr Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April is the trigger for the strict ban to apply for at least the next five years.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers life and led to the US's biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of opposition and industry.
The advocates therefore want to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf are still not fully resolved.
The criticism focuses on the UK energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A Commission of Investigation on Obama's behalf will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop he had taken after the explosion.
Afterwards, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had been called into question after numerous corruption allegations, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax locks for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now warning publicly that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower due to stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban, a current industry survey by the consultant company.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change precisely with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would continue to be suspended - burdening growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
"Don't stop," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to light up a boy who is watching the chest in the water with the sluices surrounding him: the scene is almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored waterglass.
The fact that brown crude oil sulphur floats under the surface cannot be seen.
She used to collect shrimp here, and Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the low-flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline cast a lot of crude oil into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours in order to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is considered one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps covered by river rivers, the entire extent of destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat will grow up brown broth, who will dip his hand into the water, pull out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise out of the ground like black lakritz poles, saddening palms to be found to hang their weeds.
Bird shoals, as they are common in wetlands, are sought out for nothing: as soon as the outboarder is silent, the former paradise is spread out in the atmosphere that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari Window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers arrived here, where, in the 1980s, the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized the first resistance, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil worker.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While from the entire delta region the threefold size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drills and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped over two million barrels of black gold daily, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the location of the Group.
Every couple of hundred metres of steel bars such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called much too tenderly the heads of the drill holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the Mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant flow of crude oil runs into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have flown into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year the amount of oil, as it pushed into the sea at the havary of the Super Tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Anyone responsible for the ongoing Eco-GAU will be disputed about it.
During the Shell Group Sabotage and the organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bristling drill heads and leak pipelines as main causers.
Shell imposes considerably lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner submitted to the Group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a abandoned, oil-shrinked workshop in the open sky, the mangroves appear out of the mangroves: they are divided and oil-smeared to the neck.
Among the many barrels that are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered out on the grounds, a fire flickers: an illegal little refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates the pot through the pipes; later, at the end of the line, kerosene and, finally, diesel pushes out.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres every day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price, which is almost 40 euros per litre, can still afford the illegal cook: because their raw material is free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and tightened it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more due to the relocation of the population or the lax mode of production is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they hadn't destroyed the basics of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship, especially with Shell, was destroyed so that only a deduction of the Group would be asked: "Maybe other nationalities, like the Chinese, are more likely to emerge."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"Highest time you disappear," says the musculous oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful lubrication money.
Like all Nigerians, soldiers originating mainly from the country's nords also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous building errors in A380-Triebwerke
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a potential build error in the investigation of a machine that is likely to lead to a "disaster engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 engines - and is now warning of a possible failure to build.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose compound, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published on this Thursday by the ATSB Authority.
This could have led to "a disastrous engine failure".

Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against British turbine manufacturers.
It filed an appeal at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney to enable it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine's fire, parts had dissolved and the surfaces damaged.
Rolls-Royce made up an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests would be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem had been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall eliminates traffic shock
Germany in white: snow has fallen almost all over the country over the night.
Chaos, trains and flights are on many roads.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures almost the entire Republic is snowed at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic shocks in many places.
In the north and the east there are some 15 inches of thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 at Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snowing.
In addition, heavy arches swept across the Baltic Sea Coast.
The Bundesamt für Maritimefahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) awaits on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal stand.
In Saxony the snow movements on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia storm centre, alarm stage was therefore violet - the highest level ever.
Partly, 30 cm of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to rising traffic and traffic.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to German railways, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turns are the main problems.
In Saxony the long distance from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesman of the flight information center, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport-Sprecher, 40 flights have already been removed in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers at the airport were available to them, there were still nearly 400 beds.
On many roads, accidents already occurred on Wednesday evenings.
In the evening, a truck driver perished during the collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: There was also a truck on a rail crossing, because the vehicle was still stuck.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing herself with her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will grow up with light trees.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - somewhere up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money store is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The Deutsche Bank has only made its corporate seat pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, the banks have been allowed back to their old workplaces.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs for renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale did not mention the speaker.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution is already issuing its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund in mid-2007 and subsequently renovated intensively.
The energy conversion increased the data to around 200 million euros.
I guess a sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers now renamed "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourning around dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the abandoned miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be hid because the safety situation in the disaster shaft is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth came to a violent explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the disaster box but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent demonstration, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy anymore.
The bodies could not be stored until now.
Now members and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island with radiant sunshine.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the abandoned miners, 29 tables were set, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags weighed half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemoration.
"But they have never come home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also shaken.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were pushed off, it started to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit to the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" new genre boundaries.
What audience may Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torments and, with almost superhuman forces, turns his opponents around in turn - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabian killing methods and his enemies have already taken the breaths out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, as he is actually called, Einauge does not say the whole film, and also the other figures can at most tear one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it will be silenced and swallowed up in the gruesomely beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery of the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematists with interest in internationalism and very quiet camera rides.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humorous or less brutality.
Most of the art cinema friends should be dissuaded from the squirting brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die from boredom at the latest when Einauge breaks up to Jerusalem for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship and traps an eternity in flauze and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to swim there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which earned some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a strict act, it's all atmosphere, a filmed fiebertraum.
And there's no escape for the audience.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of relaxation and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly gets his throat to him, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that beats him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy who is loyal to the eye preserves something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
At the very least the single-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies eventually becomes the warrior from hell, possibly as the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps it is only for those who are already spoiled.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Riddling Earthwork
The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to give its opinion - it still allows controls.
Towards midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrat; the nearest major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has supposedly built in the quadruple with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that runs off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US Foreign Secret Service CIA of late April 2008, even under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, the common reactor would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the 50's hardly works.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
By computer animation, she blended in where the components of the reactor should have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had stood shortly before commissioning, it was called but not yet fitted with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly any more is known than then, yes, the puzzles became rather larger with time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret servicers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "predictive reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation " plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in summer, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly set aside the shelter of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team was found under the former chief inspector Olli Heionen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, IAEA received satellite images from commercial suppliers from the time immediately after the attack that would be more meaningful than the CIA presented.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always been concerned about never operating a secret nuclear program or building a reactor.
The uranium tribes of the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, according to the analysis of the particles, the IAEA declined as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as about the satellite pictures.
It also prevents the controllers from having a second inspection in el-kibar and from accessing the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel also swears irons.
"We will never comment," confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
In this way, the case's investigation since June 2008 has been without results and "is increasingly developing into a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear barrier treaty that the IAEA is waiting for.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike this still exist.
The inspectors have not so far disclosed what facilities they have or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and discovered a building complex of Masyaf on satellite images, most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - with this very reason Syria of the IAEA is refusing access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to find military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip of U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three places and the quadre on the euphrate.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it, on these central questions there are at least plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the bulk has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-kibar on the other side of the euphrate, which Syria has investigated for its fitness as a warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria carried out groundwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
It also states in diplomatic circles that IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - alone showing the extent of the interest of inspectors.
However, Damascus also turned down this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had apprehended that the reactor was destroyed, that is why the matter had no high urgency, such as U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the most severe means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out checks.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but still he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, it takes a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they find nothing at all?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless director's debut in summer, there is trouble.
The script she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for unrest.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, continues to fall in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and then some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female War Victims wrote about the UN refugee aid work UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie himself is an ambassador of the UN refugee aid work.
Diplomatic she is not - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they rejected.
The meeting had to be held in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps didn't exist, and Jolies's attitude toward the victims told her enough about the script.
According to their organization, the UN refugee aid work recommended that Jolie be released as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author himself is concerned that she does not follow political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is still on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers in it knew about the outbreak of war and meet again when, a Bosnian Muslim, she is dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different from the version "rape victims are getting messed up in torture-knecht".
That Jolies film actually begins before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you may only be able to provide peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by making the script, as so many before, illegal.
Nothing like getting out of here
That evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No trace of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer with joy in moaning loud music, stamping with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in the Southern Irish Cork trembles, because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, there are 500 Euro winning prizes plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restraining computerist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself to divert himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a multifaceted feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had crouch, zuck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
A hundred thousand Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, predicting experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of migration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish people, Tristesse is now once again widening.
The economic crisis in particular insures the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only been uphill so far.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in abundance.
But now three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In Irish Times there are also readers' letters of young immigrants who complain: "All goes down the brook in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future rising, because the government is just playing eye-catching and no longer offering the young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observed her commutations hanging from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on working abroad.
"For professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
Show photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada on his website.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels, elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan now hardly sees his home, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, after a long time he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I made money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never."
He laughs something shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well maintained courtyards, in the entrances parking large expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 350,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing complaint he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Work abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look at how it works with life somewhere else.
A few years of work in London he's already behind him, and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still bothering him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could be in a living party.
"Not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big swallow from his beer.
"Okay, that sounds frightening."
"Let's call it a game, easy, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatric Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private enterprises.
Crime is a major problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of promoters of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-up last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (gram 3).
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also lasted during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin America's countries experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year).
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and popularity of the divorcing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in widespread progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents over-regional indicated that the private sector is essential for development, and in 2007 there were 56% (see Graph 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A dial-up tab
No one expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral helpers who rushed to help the bred country.
Overcrowded electoral organs, multiple votes cast, election notes in the Rinnstein, destroyed electoral sites and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Selectorals opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that election results be lifted due to a alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many matters".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is alleged to be committed to the unloved President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected selection is available for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, Rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial insecurity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent from the voters, explains that the electorate is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a small turnout was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization at the vote.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 IDs that are needed for election were not yet distributed.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.

In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove its popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
However, whether you are helping to re-election next year depends on whether the apparent mourning Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after the election of his wife, often set up budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president to spend the extra revenue on his own account.
In the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further distortions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian beat another person in the face and others accused the government of bribery) the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss this," the President said.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, with the President having even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction its main objectives, rather than inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then looked like official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate course?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may wish to re-join Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's former debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which she owes $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as was usual elsewhere.
However, last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, as it would be the first step towards cleaning the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of which has enough of the Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will have been cut off.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift up many political decisions of her husband silently and quietly.
Weaker applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On November 27th, more than 7.5 million voters, that is 70% of all voters, went to vote in mayors and city councils in the five districts. This is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the development of pioneering business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is himself a symbol figure for the relationship with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country in 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only scarce.
Although his Kuykang party (KMT) has three of the five mayors, she has not received a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convois with crane makers, flag-swinging mass covers and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT delivered a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
When a man shot him out of the crowd in the face. Line was wounded and an impoverished spectator killed.
Bizarrlicher is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill line or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of that, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
China may have been the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Beijing government.
But this time the DPP also avoids making the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, she would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support their China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent an negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration. But the most important thing first.
It will wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found strong support as president of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forging as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "confidential alternative" to Mas forefast approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the Pragmatist Su not to give up the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidates.
KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to wage their election struggle without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing divisions between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there's no way back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take part in the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was overdrafted for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the Jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her charming voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums, which resulted in a huge success.
The competitors of Iyers include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positotly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a lavish favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, in which albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well-deserved in the category Grossgruppe. He thus goes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, is presented with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The enchanted Wanderer" were nominated by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt für Symphony No. 4, Daugherty für "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze für "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg für "Graffiti" und Shchedrin für "The enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The about 30-minute piece is named Los Angeles and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in prison in Russia.
Dranman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dranman said in a phone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for recording Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Nichx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Klassik-Crossover, Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed to the project that both terrorism and traffic should be promoted.
However, according to a statement made by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"This valley is where wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to Press Enterprise, were quite evenly distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Freedom is dead in sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new Mediterranean-style 2300 m2 mosque should have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approx.17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project in the city council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live, among other things, of arsenic opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view that life is possible even without the elements regarded as vital to life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorous or arsenic."
"This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'other' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"What else is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the Ariel D. report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in searching for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were given, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start with other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's astrobiological institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphor are similar chemically, it assumed that microbes, both exposed, may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the chemical nature of the arsenic."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphor. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost disguises everything," says Anbar.
The researchers put out the GFAJ-1 bacterium of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adjusted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorous, it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsen is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has not been a working example.
Arsen was more frequent in the early earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life can have developed differently than in the early age of the world," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Energy Ministry and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition sounds found in Compton
According to Los Angeles County Sheriffs, the other two of the four exhibits stolen from a Bellflower motel were found from Thursday.
The four exhibition-hundreds - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when the unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well on," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the location of the dogs nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say any more," says Whitmore.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district pet home in Downey.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas Trace, a three-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch, were unharmed according to the government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer doll, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - in her motel room.
The thicker Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a split wide so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.
Peek promised a finder's wage to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new beginning.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge blessed the "prepared" track plan to lift the debt of $5 billion and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and TV shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the reboot of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the rather despected studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force for MGM until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself brings in $75 million, runs the company. The financing is due to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, was replaced by Harry Sloan, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the MGM's financial concerns and pay out the studio's more than 140 galleys took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year everything started from the beginning when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created a year plan of seven or eight films to come to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der Kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose biggest shareholder he is.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not result in any result.
Tech Toys balances your gift budget
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans play doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a toy "R" Us and a BJ's wholesale club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-powered toys are on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs singing a note when pressing their stomach.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheelblocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you certainly remember the first computerized toy.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a lot of questionnaires with which a car ride can become an hour of instruction, with a better user with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most easy-to-use solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leaprog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, familyphotos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about to put together the blocks before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised booktaber competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy e.g. a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be rollers or a puffle duster.
The latest cell-powered microrobot, hexbug nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a irrational garden of clots.
And he's holding a lot of things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even took some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and dampened voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised the viewers for their arbitrary razzias and their slope to violence.
" Stand still!"
"Click straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely grown up from the teen age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood straight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped stripe.
"They look on average for me," Mr. Tang said in a mediocre way.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
Instead of the grey green, the province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform.
Wuhan replaced violence with low rigidity in Central China: in 2009, 50 officials circled a misplaced snack truck and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 660,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police regimes. They have been selected specifically due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give a softer, feminine aspect to the rough-slide police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce the urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat an audience to death when he filmed them with his cell phone, as they slammed down a protest against a garbage neck.
Last year, a Beijing official training manual was stolen and published on the Internet describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chenguan makes the government afraid", the China Daily national newspaper voted last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics are in favour of the current approach for significantly inadequate.
When the district sought eight female recruits per ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job advertisements, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonious facial features".
You should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, work for women over 25 is too strenuous physically.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district officer at the practically government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "internal qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but in addition they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, does not wish to contribute to this description,
However, admitted that in China sizes in job advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform features.
Whether it's equalizing with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical redundancies do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lambs or Buckliges here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple biscuits and a well formed mouth.
They did not feel as sexist that so much value was placed on their appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" asked her with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply shy through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are chased.
"Mr. Wang, get out of here."
"We have already told you so often!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his noodle kitchen mounted on a bicycle car for a while.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It is almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten to report to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public infringements that Chinese officials are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, bordered after the rumors of having killed Chengguan officials.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, on which the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 persons gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations on the sidewalk.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a gruesome face took the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male strip, remained back. He turned his white name to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going through verbally."
"Sometimes, however, physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Procurator will not sue Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations that, after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity against him, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious allegation against Senator Ensign, Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal that caused headlines throughout the country and put a dampen on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could impose a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were discontinued and that no further charges were made on this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign failed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during a campaign of Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton’s work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after Hampton’s lobbying.
As Hampton was recently still in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do any lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on spin-door lobbying.
According to the published indices, "it seems that everything is dealing with an agreement and the violation of the turn-door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialises in the defense of clients who are in government visors.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethicists said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats which were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misbehaviour by the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously fearful," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in US parliament and government), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another next day when he was told that the ministry would not sue his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defender had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated again in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation due to a separate action by the Ethics Group, after which a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents had violated Hampton's law.
The electoral commission said there had not been enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company passed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also appointed for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister for Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
When, for the first time last year, information on this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and left his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the Republican ranking.
After many months of noticing, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was entering a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set up his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing into the cranes in the courtroom.
In the minute, they sent their reports on cruel witness statements about Twitter.
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday the carefully persecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's statement of the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed requests to the court that explain reasons for calling and that will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that, through intensive reporting on the process - also through extensive use of Twitter through average reporters - it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and an immediate penetration of intrusive details so that the jury has been inadvertently influenced by public disarmament.
This opposition could cause the Appelation Courts to address the question of whether the new technologies would make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hay's main defender.
The president, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Chamber Court last week, briefly rejected the requests by decision when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court proceedings have found that reporting on well-known and infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States abolished the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was to have killed his wife, and in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" due to the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings that Mr. Hayes considers sentence half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication paths from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the New Media in processes that are being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appelation courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who represent Mr Hayes' lawyers to discuss years and therefore delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced already, when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gray-eyed crime scene photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had fulfilled them with horror.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he would have exerted undue pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may have the greatest interest in them.
In a judgment contest they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had constantly reinvigorated the flames of emotions over the case.
"One such daily demand of media peeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even throughout the country."
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more incisive than reports that are reprehensible at a slower pace is a technological anti-technical view which undermines reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appelation courts would often face the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In its opposition, it referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the judgment of Dr. Sheppard was abolished due to the reporting and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of abuse and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and peaks of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the major questions to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions are no longer taken.
According to all that one hears, it was not a courteous discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Commission of the Deficits on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect which conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise is called upon, while one himself tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed leadership of the parties.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as one might expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that dominated the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are within miles of each other.
Last but not least, the Washington November elections voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment funds is to be expected, even if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favorite tax cuts for the rich are to be denied unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased, that we can agree on these questions during the "lame dock session" and at the same time also ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brooking's Insituation warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame dock session should not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties if the new 112th Congress is called in in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a pretight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea-party voters whose education was useful.
As concerned as the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and eliminate health reform.
These party lines are already made clear in the first reactions to the recommendations made by the Commission of the deficits, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes and the increase of retirement age and the reduction of public expenditure.
Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much insisted on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan a formal recommendation and they are struggling very much to get close to it.
The largest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for action or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges about the state budget, the taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a culprit as it happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyity and polarization are today larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at that time between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a much wider choice in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that is worn to the show this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two from each other.
Transmitted US document portraits Moscow as port of corruption
The city's control lies in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Police as well as the State Security Service extort high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - takes its part from the money that the leaders move up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beirut was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime it would have been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption accusations over years, and he has won numerous slanders against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That's what polls have done.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individual persons are mentioned, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with crime has led some to call them "distorted" and conclude that the government acts more like a Kleptokrat than a government," says the Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends through the police, state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB cashes money from the biggest companies and arrests the police small businessmen.
A source, so it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as sought after as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or other pretext.
Medvedev has talked about fighting corruption several times, but at the same time he noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without a opposition, without a separation of violence, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, as estimated by Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks at 154th place of a recent investigation on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (states are listed from "at least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow late evening, will certainly trigger failure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction that is an important factor in internal politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a lighted, concrete class room with dirty and leafy walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the anxiety grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodia's society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youuk, Head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits up families itself."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of diseases, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnameses fell and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed, the regime's remnant and its military fled to the border of Cambodia.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base to the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not returned, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in the Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," Sok Leang said from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are embedded in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice builder.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears of Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told Cambodia's documentation center that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thoma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers were expected to die.
On a hot evening, in the chaem from working on the fields, came back to her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadow on the withered grass, the chaem refused to discuss their past at Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, it would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would sue more suspiciously, even though experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youuk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means combining the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that as everything can understand."
The center created the first schoolbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages via Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains, a road covered by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black rose, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the roadside said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would put a bush of mature bananas - hoping he would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to collect further weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For many years the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But officially the U.S. government told Washington Post that two secret agreements with Belarus have been signed over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nucleary Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How do we keep high-rich uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally armed, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs from it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say officially.
It has been loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officially.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarus's research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated in order to build confidence", led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-extended Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram of U.S. ambassador in Madrid reveals.
It is added that former deputy government minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, which accused aid for human rights-respecting practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Minister admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero in the remote" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain did not object to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed" in order not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to give much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as they lie in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of documents of the Spanish Secret Service Center (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any defamatory or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments," laments Aguirre.
During a lunch in March 2007, when Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba commented that "although the Spanish judges were madly intent on their independence and did what they consider appropriate", he gave his employees instructions to avoid "blow-up rhetorical comments in order to make the tension run away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the procedure of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero's acts of the USA, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, have tolerated or deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasizes.
The child murderer admitted that she had complained on the Internet about the "married" of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mondica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she runs from a small town, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, one needs to know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman had a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she resolved her relationship, she became aware that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his wife never had him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter she entered into a different relationship.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a communication she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm just going to stay there until 19 because I have to imagine a job on 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she's taking her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone but my mother", a dubious intention if you consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me such a shit."
On 30th another: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangalogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (title)".
The last man who lived with her, a dedicated hunting officer, explains to have a lack of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Magica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca in Palma Province Prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not recall the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the Little One."
Before that, however, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and store his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
The results of November 28 could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important growth in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not - more than positive because the number of votes that this party makes in these elections is usually twice as high as those in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while the figure in the regional elections was only 316,222 in 2006.
The PPC made 384,091 votes last Sunday.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP - were to continue, the analysts of PP predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress members in the parliamentary elections, while CiU four (now 10) would also win and PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently has three - while ICV could hold its Members or win one.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be May 2011. Also, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the city governments with the largest household: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not absurd for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of its votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
And Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Mr. Ross, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also seen a significant increase.
At present the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell made Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians arrested by the police officers from the Barcelona Police Department and Nigerians formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cell, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "movement to the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attacks in Bombay, who in 2008 demanded 106 dead - provided passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister has a great significance in these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that "operation Kampai" has been "weakened" and "so their ability to act" by the fake apparatus Al Qidas worldwide.
The researchers assume that in the two years when the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they forged and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that their "combaters" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries.
The exposed cell is not the only jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why other European police units, besides the Thai investigation bodies, have also contributed to research. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the EU area over the next few days, such as those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistan-based Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Ifikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand where Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - especially tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is underlined that until now no connections between the arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay could be demonstrated, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent to the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the life of 106 people, several days before Catalonia's attack.
The police have confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally their terms to support his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which do not differ from the ones already made during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned with the certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who had won her last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois regionalist party CiU is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the PPC's party president is concerned, it calls for "all discourses affecting the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - to be made to support the accession of the party chief of CiU to a referendum.
Both political leaders believe that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of regional administration slimmer and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's entry into office deal with the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolor's Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition.
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not rule out that her nurse killed over eleven older people.
The leaders of La Caritat's old nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference showing the damage that the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the institution.
Joan Sala, head of the home of the Altenpflegeheim, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss of sight, because it did not establish the criminal acts of the caregiver in due time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat completely rejected this point and stated that "unremaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there were no indications of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
He was already baptized as "Death Angel" last night eleven murders and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that one and a half months later he murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, as opposed to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that personnel access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes to free patients from their sufferings at death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from inside by giving them bleaching as he had done according to confession to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the caregiver’s statements, not even as regards the number of committed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his course of eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made themselves available to them for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
European Central Bank's (ECB) dry-farming
The investors responded yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk increases of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has barely been added to points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which is to the extent that it collapses again, but due to the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to make a withdrawer tomorrow in two years' time, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of public debt, as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should only be maintained a single week of unlimited access.
Following the crisis in Ireland, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least by March" and to maintain quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, yesterday's excellent response to the markets will be thrown back again and if it insists that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that the purchase of government debt papers could not be considered and the markets would then collapse again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot of stuff with which she provocated a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year-old government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting market perception changes according to Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 in the future. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are nationalised.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government must receive parliamentary approval for its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has more moderated her discourse with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is asked to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, the reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job acquisition measures.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the government and the Spanish Central Bank responded quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March, and interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed in the short term.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only being but also appearance counts."
Only courage, we can do this!
At the request of his children, Eulen's Chairman of the Board of Directors is advocating the general meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fail.
David Álvarez, founder of the company belt, will challenge the association meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, since he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - holder of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute for the control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not seem to be willing to give in to the control of El Enebro's institutions in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Register.
The association meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunder blow in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The Judge's call for the assembly to be held is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the Society's Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "difference of the applicants - his five children - to be recognized by means of legal sensibilities, fraudulent activities and legal abuses as annulled assembly of 18 January", as official spokesperson explains.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital at El Enebro's asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the matter to be decided by the judge in the hearing on the appeal proceedings for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this fine universe.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise in career during the last season, all of them won the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso at the end track last November.
Without wanting to lower the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the motor of Renault, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in hand, and thus created a winning team, has become legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with authors.
This computer program known as PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high precision instruments.
The purpose is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens Industry Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements found on the race and during the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, an average of ten technicians were working in the racing stables, which were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bulls team. With powerful computer installations, they conduct analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality by means of advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars, which a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially journalists - are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The crew comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drinking manufacturer places in the services of his participation in the racing tracks, further protagonists hide themselves, whose support is invaluable and their reputation is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey's technologist stressed that five years ago he was able to say that the progress in R & D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots' contribution is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they "are not predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) started his first exclusive workshop in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday.
It is the first one of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open over the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, described as an example of the converted shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been cooperating for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming openings, but did not rule out Madrid being the next target.
The vice-president, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store was always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for touching). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales outlet network was intended to "supply the customer service and the advice of small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and then even optimize the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a link to the Technical Headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed in particular for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'claw' his rivals in three years'
The managing board member of Banco Zabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates which banks try to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - one still too existing subject.
Zabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - which is the major challenge that this bank is facing, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
A further principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, austerity, cost reduction, and the challenges that the Bank will face with it will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets during these difficult times, as the financial crisis has mixed up all the banks' plans worldwide.
This year, Zabadell will complete its four-year plan of optimisa, which was initially designed for three years, but was extended by one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "silver" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "creating work" - essential for the survival of banks.
Although it assumes that the war on liabilities, which punishes the interest margins, the risk surcharges, which banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity, are already reduced to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credit."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued the arrangement to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy "to increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "normally increasing" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are going to slip off in red numbers.
He felt that FROB could replace the money market with capital increases.
After ensuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he denied the argument of some bankers who had already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but in contrast to events in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis caught.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkasse Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"The most important part is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiry, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he pointed out.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unabated opinions about the slowness of the process, the insanity and senselessness," because "Banco de España exhorts us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world and added that those who doubted did this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we must "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Market tensions have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of temporary workers or repealing the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the Deputy Minister, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It is presumptuous that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective for the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, three possible ways out of the crisis are beginning to be speculated in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The Second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third parties: a reform of the euro according to German proposals. This means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the requirements; possible ways of setting payments to some countries and extending the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguishing itself for some time now. Therefore, there are no reasons.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits, and the German government took a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of disintegration between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country in a painful way, as Merkel put out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has come out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country's rescue and, at the same time, require private lenders to pay part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it is moving forward with the Ireland crisis and everything that follows.
But its proposal, if something has been taken up, has been adopted. In the coming months, we will be participating in the European Union reform to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says that even if unpopular measures are to be taken now, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which countries which are severely penalised can be forced to declare themselves incompetent and in this case the private sector will have to take part in the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in boom times, is simply not accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be bad at not understanding it.
It is not just about driving down the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will move more calmly.
And that we will use the opportunities offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like it would change.
Among the possibilities considered is the fact that we would not have to leave the euro area fully stuffed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportal act or not, and whether the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already gained clearly) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the required sanctions in the next match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the participating players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten, but followed by the rules in this sport.
Part of the upcoming debate about the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who in his Hymne offers noble courage and honour and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode more to his long history than theatrician and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate focuses on whether or not it does not expressly contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a regular outline. In fact, this procedure adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to ignore its sense.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from taking unfair advantage of the counter-team. Nor did it.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under misplay or regular bypass, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible for it to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was not brought into an unfavorable situation nor that advantages were attached to the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next season of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, as the team might eventually leave out. Furthermore, players receive a sanction with this procedure and pass into the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
This does not make it so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of regular circumvention), they wanted to choose when they submitted to them.
They made a strategic decision not to avoid or flee from punishment.
Although the boundary between the inventiveness and the regular environment is blurry, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics were caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provocative control transfer.
The damage caused by these actions by the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer reception for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar lets a avalanche of reservations fall this year to days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are wide. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas season that lead to Barcelona’s hospitality and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders to the week of 13 December, with the result of a avalanche of dinner reservations on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinner on budgetary grounds.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
As the economy is always in place, the lowest prices are demanded, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Gastättengememium, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dachverband dares not to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they pay strong attention to the prizes," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "supply quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most requested by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17 leads the suppliers to the collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost, since since the second quarter of the year the revenue is again flourishing and good, although in a few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business are seen.
Sources of the group of companies stress that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who are celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than a price hit was added to the six group menus. The impression is that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and wish more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies too, green sprouts are seen, which is why employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
From the roof association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations are quite "living" though the customers "put out a maximum".
However, the fun at the celebration would not have gone back, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "more quickly than any other country".
Exhibitions of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms this enormous concern the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the brink of clarification and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal, they reveal that cooperation between both countries is not reinforced in terms of atomic security, but rather "takes away" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people who are implied in the nuclear arsenals and rocket programs is no longer considered by the USA, but also by Russia as far-reaching and reason to be careful.
"Pakistan needs to recruit strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to report people who are working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with their North American colleagues.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internet Portal is that the cooperation between the USA and Pakistan is lagging behind in terms of nuclear distribution and the increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating": "There is no transparency at all; on aid offers we receive no answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lawoy, official of the South Asian State Secret Service, confirms that "with the economic catastrophe Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent over-support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's chief
Obama appoints a highly responsible person for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and detection of Assange.
Everything associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, she's not new. She's from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to put in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as 20th, the International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receipt of authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries need to identify and find Assange, "to temporarily capture and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states consider the red warning to be a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stop.
Assange's action was annoyed by lawyers who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was prepared to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief Security Officer of Stalin, who received such approval.
"This is like hunting, not like a legal persecution," is accused in writing.
While the world is looking for it - and its mother of Australia is concerned with the innocence of her son - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine by Skype from an undetermined place. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats who have pioneered UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "laughter and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he told the sender CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a highly responsible person for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of the speaker of the President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announce in these days.
As of January, Congress member Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of setting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to confiscate their funds and anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, consultant to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target board and use a non-manned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever sent out information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and everything that is not execution is a punishment for itself," he told the station Fox.
Puigcercós looks for peace in the ERC with an eyewinner
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe in order to get out of the way for the 60th time an internal riot in the ranks of, after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes, without direction from the ERC.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation does not suffice for the closeness of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor himself and will not harm him the same headbreak as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra, with a wink, tries to win the new critics, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
Yesterday, at the beginning, ERC’s more than 200 regional council members announced that they could secretly express themselves about their remaining in office.
With constituencies, not with a high hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penitentiary for the president, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel himself with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without any percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carods are demanding more from the President than only to provide his office to the Party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the top organ of congresses.
But since they do not have sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Management Board on a plan of action from now on to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will be submitted to the Council for consultation on 18 December.
Their intention is to invest in Puigcercós. In return, he is promised to present the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party leaders already consider to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that polyphony is damaging stability, and he strives for every time to enable the organization to wash its dirty clothes behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that the Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party president would be supported "in exchange against different goals".
He picked up five of them, two of them in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the Board of Management so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a function.
In doing so, he fought for a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, who had already fought for it at the last two congresses, from the end of the general assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the party leadership was assigned to review the general assembly principle at a congress, which should deal with the reform of the statutes at the convention in 2008.
This date is still pending, as infogle of the internal rest of the past years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sector on the horizon, the time could have come to re-open and complete this matter forever.

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon trace levels and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China considers its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and transform its industry.
He stated that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work on this matter together with the international community.
He stated that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutions building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he stated.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving targets, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained that several multiannual plans have already been launched or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another to exchange traditional bulbs through energy savings and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally accepted.
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent overall contribution to the pollution.
Similarly, there has been unprecedented progress in the field of energy use, and energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the past five years and a further move is due to take place by 2020.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Navajo
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party president had the right to turn to the National Ordinance Commission and to ask for what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Navajo Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barriento's exclusion had been right and that the former PAN president had the right to turn to the National Ordinary Commission and to ask for what was right to him.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espinos was a local decision.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to refer to the Comisión de Order del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Navajo Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December when his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a prelude to the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "no fear of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the one or the best chairman who would need Acción Nacional for the next three years. Therefore, he gave the stafats "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer each of the five to the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the upsurge of the party in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, carried the flag and observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When asked about the criticism of the PRI of President Felipe Calderón for his course in the course of his four-year government, César Navajo called on the PRI's followers to reflect on the six-year period of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than that of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government would be able to express such expressions as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no prohibition of mouth in that country and even less censorship.
Obama works in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States called on the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on legalisation of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," twittered Obama.
Its brief communication contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document calling on the public to enter into contact with its senators under consideration, since the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice on which we are waiting, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block all voices for each law, except the expansion of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockade of Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"All of us agree that the tax issue must be handled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law that could coordinate the initiative to legalise undocumented students from next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who had immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in this country for the last five years and registered to a higher educational institution or to the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the intercessors of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them said Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other democrats are to decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The Republicans most widely recruited include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lymeux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they were no longer supporting it on another occasion.
Another Republican, who had pronounced himself in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
With literature put your finger in the wound
The second round of 'The Desire in Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," spitted the Argentine scripting station sweetly against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, which was moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celeiro, and then marked Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but clues to the guide of her story.
The infector leaves her convinced: "Constinence is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explained to her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst clears the secret: "the wound is that really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that this is really open and not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he called 'Lob der Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
He tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back widely traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turn of turn and reported about America, the great novel that it did not lack from the beginning on its own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) mocked the pre-explained witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with incarnation, who even lost the shame."
However, he emphasizes, "It is the crazy and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows, to which side the story belongs, where fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Traditional Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the Fil had contributed to the round table 'The Fingers in the Wunder'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting their country, like Latin America, as a result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentional commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and obligation that builds between the author and readers like a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this fingers of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer."
He noted that in a fast-lived world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and a little yes behind every denial."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuances often mean to put the finger in the wound and harass those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noticed and invited to discover the meaning of writing.
Romano struggles for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game there are also two different styles set by their trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held himself well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has performed consecutive games with the same team.
The Santist stratege achieved the first final play at 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike back again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out indifferent after 210 minutes, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the accident and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I'm giving myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what's going on before is the most important," said the tax collector, asking him about the lost end games.
The last end game has remained strong in his memory, he assures us to learn a lot from it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not pew the end, we can not celebrate, we are on the line prepared the players also, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two elephants already, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooting, does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce striving to keep the title in the hands already, which left us something behind for this end game, and we hope it won't come to it this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be only second champion anymore and for the first time to taste the fame that the titles bring with them.
The United States is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their call at the consulate to the visa services; costs will be reduced in such a way as to reduce waiting times.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for visas in the United States Embassy and in the Consulates shall be amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves at the visa application service offices (ASC, the initial letter in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with a request (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visas do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation in the Consulate will have less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Chihuahua, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called on a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for beings in space.
The National Aerospace Authority (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented by experts in astrobiology at a press conference held at NASA in Washington tomorrow at 13.00. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a surveillance fund for the search for extraterrestrial life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there can be human beings in hostile environments that have so far been considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was rejected that they could turn into intelligent living beings, as human beings, when their living conditions improved.
It seems that this is a microbe found on the ground of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all life forms that might be thought to exist, since the lake is very arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a source of survival. Taking this ability into account, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "it actually gives a different life form, a second life form that differs from that known to us."
Tomorrow, Thursday, the Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its discovery at the press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether his chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrion form a opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system is being introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already a opposition block was installed, led by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrion Montalvo, who presented themselves as independent. The four questioned: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the introductory session began in the 60th legislative period Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrion Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, since they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, co-ordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in its capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political framework with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They were based on their political will and if they did not, they would again be wronged by both parties, with which the opposition coalition would end.
"I come to this point (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrion and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of legal reform that must rule an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members, and they talk to other colleagues so that they can become more," said Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to the prelude of PAN and PRI that the Congress has now turned into a 'bowder' for two.
"Previously, it was only one party, now they split up the two."
Mr Montalvo requested that Members be respected and assigned their place to the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of the top decisions of five, which are likely to be nine Members, and the five which are currently seen as being divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because due to the reform carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Administration pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check about a little more than 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This amounts to 1 200 000 pesos, which was paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, the cheque issued at 200,144,56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "calculation of open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is being observed by the auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and as a result the number of cheques that are still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought from her, only the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "shown" again in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the suppliers have not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published on July 25 the examination of checks issued by the City Administration to its suppliers, it became known that from March 2008 until July 9, 2010, the municipality had paid Camacho Palazuelos for over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
It also took place shops with Jumapam where they attracted cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested to give special attention to the authorities, the areas in poor condition and the poor picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealership, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to care for the destination and to transform the bad conditions found by tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and roads had had a negative effect, as tourists would get to sleep and see the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politics don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the ongoing maintenance work of the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid doing so once again. How it should do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, and we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unfit and incomplete," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in shots," he added.
"These arrangements were not given enough attention, and these kinds of incidents are simply what is obvious to all: Maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist locations of Mazatlán because they were not used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the forerman together with the city. The city should be a clean, proper and attractive place for tourism.
"Surely Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which at first would have to be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive for tourism and to lead them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members take the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a worthy Parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in a hurry and is facing major problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday, consisting of seven political forces, 19 of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That's a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Board of Entrepreneurship, proposed that the new Members take the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival co-parses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He mentioned that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and their groups, because there were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work on the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give them the necessary status in the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understood that it was the ministry with the second-less means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bikes and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longing.
For the parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes on the next three-king day, because the household is no longer composed of twelve persons and one goat'sbock.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband doesn't have a job, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon, I'm going to go shopping on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me that 'I would so like this monster', but I answered him, 'let us wait, boy' because it was very expensive', and Cayetana was sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; of the ten-year-old Isaías size 10, during the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is Searched' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, around ten home searches were made in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly in drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men, who are considered to be the main wiredriver of the drug ring, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared already hours after their arrest before the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be charged with the charge of the production of cannabis whose property is charged for sale, plotting and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation activity that took place for over a year.
"The information received from a public source has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Unit Estries of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, which the Government intends to deal with the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be instigated in advance after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am with a party that has put shackles at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the assembled Members.
The liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person to be detained for up to one year as identified as transporting illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party was not steadfast enough toward the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to implement through another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the conservatives because he seeks the blame of the refugees and holds children captive for at least one year," Chow said.
Minister of immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal procedures affecting Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kennedys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opponent would immediately explain himself to his voters.
The new unity finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new unit on the fight against corruption and collision by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investment on this topic last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not the least discussed in spite of Robert Dutil's presence at the meeting of the Quebec Police Committee on 29 October last year.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parte Québécois, qualified this announcement in punko public security as a "canine enchanted from the hat" as well as "at a table end correct solution".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Policy Systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec that a special mandate be given to auditing the financial system so that it can carry out such research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow it to commit the people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law accordingly in order to be better committed to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Attorney of Operation Martyau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nic Toews, was currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle politicians, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
Ottawa has, as a result, passed the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several streams remain under strict surveillance because of the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were pre-evaluated.
In the evening another landslides in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere, took place.
A road has sunk together in it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfalls from 40 to 70 millilitres have been raining on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters further rainfall was expected in accordance with the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeter rain showers had gone down here.
Since the snow melt which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is to be added to these rainfalls, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service on the flood alarm concerning the rivers of Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The streams in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière are here becoming the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte a escape bridge was torn away due to the strong rainfalls.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closing of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pondefract.
The security service continues to be alert and monitors the situation accurately, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, particularly Maskinongé, Assomception, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Sub-provided to some extent
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on Social Care and Haitians, as well as because of his inaccurate speech on Radio.
Although the CCNR considers that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, certain comments "may have contained little information on the social security and unauthorised negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unheard-of speech which is not appropriate for the broadcasts during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the years 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Frontkommunn des personnes assistées sociales du Quebec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide sound information rather than misleading information.
Regarding the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont held that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message presented was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the affected consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme have been a sensitive issue in family-friendly and appropriate ways."
Therefore, he was not put in charge of his person with any tadel.
The final issue was the statements relating to the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had provided a media-effective dispute in this respect that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained not to have donated in favor of Haiti aid, since it was not certain that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect represents an unauthorised negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already abolished my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board advocates the spread of an unhealed expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio operator acted "on the contrary of its obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, had to have informed its decisions once during the main transmission period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who present the ground struggle, as the mixed martial arts do not like him, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, his character worked as a security officer and the UPS company had provided his rivals with bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Carate World Championship held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"At the moment I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"The fighters from every category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Cup had been invited."
"I got babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005, I became behind me in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China on the fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where fists and footsteps are permitted as well as soil throws.
The two struggles usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter that has emerged from this type of combat sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer kept Zemmal back only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pounding guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing his finale.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project in mutual agreement with project planning companies.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to hand over this important, hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energie gérance" awarded the winning contract without public tendering.
For the Parte Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem which causes the risk of distortion of competition as well as an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of a carded game and absolves the competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games in secret, you are now performing in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ Member yesterday, at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be used in this way.
In the afternoon, Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandy had responded by saying that she had acted on a carded game in Abrede.
"I remain faithful to my line," she rang by strengthening that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and "missing her of hardness."
She said it was "the least," that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its size of work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even with relatively simple projects, is by no means an exception.
As noted in the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short transition from the Quebec company register allows for more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génavar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Energie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandy said that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a statement that the nose of the fact that the project management contract was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will be fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and you say that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that the price is not decisive, but the expertise of the people", Laporte confirmed.
This contract, approved by the consortium "Energie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parte Québécois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts in itself, Génavar had received 16 to include Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449,783,344, including the "Énergie gérance" contract over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Quebec".
Minister Normandy had made it seem that the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "financed" before she specified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer-conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusted
Green but undisputed skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but no more than the marked brands or eco-labellings to control his choice.
Harm, although bathed in a media-efficient universe, where information in favour of more responsible consumption is only so hot: the barometer responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecians still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec people admit that they do not really believe in the company's environmental commitment as much as the green business advertising, so the measuring instrument that is sophisticated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
In the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to the stimulation of this consumption segment, which is currently living on nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified by the barometer.
In addition, one-third of the Quebeceses are distrustful of the stated performance of green products and services that are sought to put them to their hands.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their district and benefited from the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - Quebec's homoconsumus loves to present itself as king of recycling trying to reduce its environmental traces by caring for animal welfare.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, says the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecians have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the co-driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The contribution and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey who fed the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-based cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to deliver it back to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, in its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond in less than the initially hoped-for amount that could create an existing solution to favourable conditions, at least according to sources which can be removed from state rumors.
A first action plan and a request after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the petition was re-corrected to a certain extent since that time.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturales" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who runs the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had given her a final fact report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to them.
In any event, the premise of state donations seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec owners community of cinemas and cinematographic complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment appealed to substantial, economic aid.
After the cinema's own-funded construction, chief Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under major difficulties, which could justify the exemption from the state funds.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are directing a privately funded campaign, from which they hope to attract a total of $700,000.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not cancel the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignored what he and his group thought of the downward-corrected proposals that were made to them.
Secret of complex rocked Canada ventilated
The new American diplomats, spread by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to the Americans under the Canadian’s inferiority complex; but they reveal the superiority of Canada with the same blow.
As a result, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published yesterday, provide even more pictitious details than the mere substantial content to be cracked.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election camp was located in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
The great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador who was used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins has various options for explaining this situation.
"The Canadian, political leaders may be more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to move the United States to black Peter (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade) in this election," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The Ambassador understands this "early debilitating silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party chief to lead such an essential relationship that the voters have in mind as a key factor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the announcement sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a company in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a revitalisation program of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese explains.
He had never mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling off the coalition and to have a bearing on the quality of the proposed engagement programme.
Another communication dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins agrees with Washington's increasingly negative image that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is alarmed by shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle references to Maher Alar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions for the purpose of hearings performed by the CIA through muscle protests.
Another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinics had asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case on the case.
"At the end of the meeting, he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State in Puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to look through the file again."
Finally, we remember that the comrades are heating up on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained about CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "imposed".
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to reducing greenhouse gas (FCKW) which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments from the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW issued on earth due to lighting, if the white-gliding pears, which until now still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the worldwide fleet exhaust gases.
Last year in Copenhagen, the major exhaust gas issuers, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce the global FFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet would have to be reduced by 5 gt to stabilise the increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reducing this energy demand by twice.
The compact light bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-flagging pear, which gives an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely novel light bulbs give very little warmth, they can also function with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have indicated that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury, and that it is therefore necessary to dispose of them as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers to provide an acceptance site.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-flooding pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects the announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the Presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after their deadline.
"The Secretary General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and to announce the preliminary results without any further delay," said a press officer of the UN Chief.
"He asks all the partners and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to include any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had failed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission would "go ahead with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may at last call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "false" voting charges in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebellion camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN-practiced maneuvers for intimidating voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's followers from taking the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contrasts are now more of a view that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, who contests any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His alliance parties affirm that Gbagbo block the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the union and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for this in the event of any appeals.
Laurent Gbagbo had taken the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), as defined by the International Employment Office (IAA), and the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Lakes.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
Involved were 3.4 million workers of the French metropolises not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the adolescents aged 15-24 were unemployed, according to data from the IAA.
The seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After an examination of his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Lakes has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continued this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was sent to Luynes prison in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets near Aix-en-Provence.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with corruption, illicit bribery, and possession of arms, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is about to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor's will ask him instead of spreading brain-spins."
"It's easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before consulting his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had been interested in giving the judge a memorandum before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A family member Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keeping his deposit that he had to lead to run.
As regards the area of business competence or the target of the associated funds, Simon would never have known.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne convicts, on Wednesday for interception and complicity, was again released under the requirement that the protagonists keep themselves away from these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client could provide explanations about the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedomů, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people had been charged and released from custody on the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to the Deputy Supreme Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Provence Métropole (MPM), is persecuted on the basis of "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier officials were also arrested, one of them, because of the title of "recruiting and disseminating general goods by a public service representative", the other because of "competence in the event of dissent of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "healing and undercutting of social assets".
One of the people who were opposed to Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained by a similar affair of dishonesty from a public source that affected Corsica.
The fan suspects suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste disposal sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
The investigation shows that the study focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace outperforms its mediocre function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran because of "spying" held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this from the point of view of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and looked through by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans his strategy, which went so far as to give these advices to deal with their own crisis of "spirits" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iraner who was held in France and sought to benefit from trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a gruesome light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomat telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the way of dealing with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own citizens, who would forcefully be held in Iran.
"May sound," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "unindebted", "so-called release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "Politics don't solve anything", pass the discussions on the inconspicuous ways that Iranians are "masters in elusive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "frequent Iranian tactics": "Sustainment for political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to come on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "remains the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro deposit).
And he lets usurpable, the Elysée anticipate further hostages, a phenomenon that "will be tightened up."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clothed rice has been released from prison twelve days ago, but will continue to be held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose delivery the United States is demanding from Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from custody after decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coinzidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad novelty.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On 4 September, on the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the decision of the judge", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a great exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "strong" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently joins in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not protect his efforts to make "flight attempts" organized by the media and by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up the "media flash of the French authorities".
On what basis is so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons why the elysée has caused it to fail.
The intensive communication efforts "incentives to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 "was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad."
"The Syrian role of building up" tries to show Paris "Syria to show which engagement can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to sow "inconsistencies between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier trusted her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything else."
"But despite everything, we thanked them."
"This should at least be a cause of confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her at the Elysée.
In a Communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschen Bridel", which will prohibit the young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, so indicated government responsibilities.
A bill designed to invite online game operators to refuse access to these games under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, describing representatives of cultural and family ministers.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning in school and also with living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure its health and the right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency Agence France Presse, who drafts this bill of law.
The online games were then available again from 6 a.m.
For a year, the producer companies had time to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also keen to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily limit of time granted to access to these games to young people whose parents ask for it added to the person responsible.
It will also provide free programmes for those who wish to make available free programmes that allow them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in international online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Championship: FIFA appoints the organizer country
In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion, FIFA's Executive Committee, on Thursday, appoints the World Championships organizers 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or pursue its branch office in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Hard to create a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the launch of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Terrii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Championship once, namely 1966.
The BBC had given the breeding ground again on Monday by sending out a documentary report that took three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to exasperate FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had been in intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the 2012 Olympic Games Organization, which was successful by Tony Blair, who had achieved the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Would this intensive commitment suffice to re-enhance the image of England before the Commission?
Nothing is less sure because the Duo Spain Portugal is not missing from ruins with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repression against the English, as well as the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase Russia's opportunities, which have become a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (states, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on behalf of the members of the Committee.
"You throw them in with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin weathered.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favourites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the World Cup 2026 permission desired by FIFA for China that makes the Asian odds fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, with the expectation of futuristic stages all the registers, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift), which is the sensitive nervousness of FIFA.
Second mandate: the openness
De Gaulle really took advantage of it.
The middle edge had made him think he'd shut up.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery, which holds the presidential function, is not well on the face.
So you have to act as if the doubt existed from now on.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing in it.
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured him in serious tone to make his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians he would make the perspective of "two mandates" seem to have spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Missing.
The President just reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment restricts the number of five-year term periods to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election in a humorous tone on the occasion of such meetings.
"You still have seven and a half years with me, or at least," he told them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Do not believe that I do not think about the phase after that."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no longer a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they raise comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS recommend earlier than accepted for combat.
The bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded directly and carefully the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he could find a defeat, he wouldn't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," explains Alain Juppé, who has found out about the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show ways out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to conclude the end of the year.
The crisis of the European public debt requires that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to also affect the present situation, more than tensely, on the European bond markets, in order not to cause its worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in solving the European budget debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchasing government bonds.
"I keep my thoughts on my European trading partners..."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at his hearing in Brussels on the eve of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, had not shown himself very much in relation to his projects, but rather had been pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would be "extended" and that we would "see at the meeting on Thursday what the decisions are taking".
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the most historicly low level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s Treasury debt purchases were doubled to approximately 1.35 billion euros last week.
And according to the indiscretions of some merchants, they should have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Overall, since May 2010, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is not in any doubted (see page 29).
People's farmers do not expect any further significant change in course.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s Arsenal, the latter will be able to create themselves in a generous manner, over a period of one week up to three months.
The people are already saying today that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in an essential way."
"At the same time, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank's economist.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Bräms, head of the People's Party at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB was to maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that would bring the future market to life," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on the markets in the euro area of government debt, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must, at any price, enter into the market placers of the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the precipitous enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest states," one of the most important bond holders reported yesterday.
If interest rates start to increase, the countries would be more likely to reduce or even stabilise their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government covers Italy
After an alarming week's start for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "individual" and heard him count on a "unpredictable" weekend, but this was immediately demented by the individual.
In any event, on Tuesday, the barge with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discount on German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "severely concerned" by the "market turbulences" and a potential risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, head of the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text this is true, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzy tax revenues that put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available for examination at the Senate is estimated to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the riot for a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are currently no problems, neither in the short term, nor in the long term, since despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d.R.) less stabilisation progress is required than from other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief executive.
Stays the question of political integrity.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a request for distrust by the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to the organisation of the elected elections at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for decision-making in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had explicitly stressed it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it was proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans clearly hold together, are willing and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction on the interest rates of the European state bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there is still no way of talking about normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt mark, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on banking systems," says the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "political times are much slower than those of markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the eurozone countries in the cross-cutting of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday in order to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first labour force expenditure is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-row countries, are sending themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms which are to be included in the savings measures, but which are intended to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid go a different way than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid asking for international assistance before they set up their own budget correction and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, had first brought forth the idea that if the 750 billions of euros were not mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to re-enter its own pocket.
The people of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of the European public debt, judge as being fully at the forefront of the player, an extension of around 100 billion euros, would be sufficient "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This funding exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
A advisory board which has every opportunity to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Above all, when market conditions are on the increase.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still pose traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now at alarm level Orange due to the threat of snow and smooth ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in the alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers are tying the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes are blocked, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic policemen who are dissatisfied from using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been removed throughout the day.
In the Picardy school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy transport.
The prefecture "demands drivers to be careful on the roads as well as to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to delete 25% of their Roissy airport from Paris on Thursday and 10% of flights starting from Orly due to the expected strong snowfalls.
DGAB recommends passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, they recall the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the way, the state has issued a capital grant of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant part of the financial sum to its dual on the markets.
Today, finally, it has come to first high-calculation.
The 2010 supplementary budget, run by the National Assembly Financial Commission, includes the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax to cover and increase the taxation of offices at the Ile-de France.
First of all, according to Article 15 of the draft law, "the public-law institution of Société du Grand Paris goes away".
This is stated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Second is a reorganisation of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to pass on this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not contained in the text.
From the 4 billions you'll be far away.
"It is stated that tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the Capital Dotation, which will be raised by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will be provided for the project gradually", the explanation must be drawn up.
At the SGP you can't find this system inconsistencies.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the project for three years and then only draw out of the 4 billions", explains the report.
"This is recorded in the budget and deducted gradually".
The SGP suggests that 2013 will be started to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four billions will still be able to seek for a long time, is at risk of creating a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Ranchy Hackers and Emsy Spiones
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a twofold meaning.
On one side, she has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (a x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than read what you've had for months in every x-like journal (except for those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the frightening caricature profile Gaddafis has long been offering cabaret artists fabric for their sketches.
The rule that the secret dossiers can only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherian publications, you will recognize that every work (via the Grail, the mystery of Renes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but that is why he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Same as the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers to be true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American Embassy in Rome to the State Department, was the same as those who had published newsweek earlier this week.
So why was such an uplifting made around the revelations of this dossier?
On one side, they testify to what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representational tasks, have transformed into spy centers.
Every viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it doesn't happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: The idea that an x-like hacker can touch the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow against the prestige of the state decency.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scarving judges" are in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's times, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if you show up what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control course ceases to be unilaterally oriented and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the rallies of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold itself that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a mystery free from mystery, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks it is clear that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not do Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer place any reserved information online - that would be equivalent to a paddling on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the latest technologies, it is to be hoped that confidential reports on telephone can be kept secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained only for certain ears in the future?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see a need to introduce myself to the government leaders, moving secretly on uncontrollable march routes, hiding their communications anywhere else than in mere memory, and moreover the few written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the watergate spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like cancer today, namely backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by spitting from the back to the front and ventilating all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: like France's financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly solved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) that have been realized by the developing countries.
And the gross French fine speeches have already been revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to spending 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and valued for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see if all developed countries make the same level of precision.
The EU announces the release in 2010 of 2.2 billion euros, bringing it on the right path to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional use has been made without compromising public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for 2009: international financing is maintained, giving 150 million over three years as part of the "fast start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that financing "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France provides for its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € borrowed as equivalent with 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that one collects as equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking in 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) fulfils their obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 to fulfill its obligations, France is just 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: in part, with a further development of the action over time and, on the other hand, with the reality of financial deployment.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (what are the other member states continuing to donate if it is enough to borrow it?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing only a small question for relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on climate.
But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its booking method for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed issue): one does not escape the question of "predictability" or the method of booking of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "receivability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of confidence necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results "does not reflect a statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent an illustration of the problem treated", had usually purchased within four food products consumed by about ten years of age at meals in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have also been studied as well as laboratories' search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is depressing: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially or probably cancer-reducing and five classified as safe carciogens, as well as 37 endocrine-disorder substances, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of cases, this survey is taken very well by the fact that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogens or substances with endocrinic disorder is alarming," says the association.
Already at breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safely proved to be carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, enclosed in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, tuna from the bush, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spitted.
At the tap water, analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroforms to light.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was at the "highest", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damage cocktail" for consumers is "presumably undervalued", says the study.
For its part, the "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "increasing civilisation diseases".
In July a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
