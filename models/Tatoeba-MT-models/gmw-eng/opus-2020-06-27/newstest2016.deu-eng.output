Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and of Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state debated solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel, and Netanyahu submits a lack of will in the peace process.
The agreement between Obama and the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteriorated.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech, which was partly valued as an affront against Obama.
The speech had not been spoken to Obama; a meeting had rejected him with reference to the current election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that had been narrated on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had been teaching 300 miles to the school grounds in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, where he shot and killed a popular historian, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police records.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the terrible emergency call sometime later.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police tied him up.
One day after shooting at the university, the students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "miraculous people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies toward problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the University's employment policy meant that the PhD, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After he escaped from campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in the spring in pedagogy.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years.
He was the women's shoal at the time.
All the girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in Jackson's suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no evidence of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Puritiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but they had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Pourtiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5. September last after Lamb ended his guitar and oral harmonics game before a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and moaning with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight memorial celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwake while the University Choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wager Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call Puritiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to recruit 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In the Christmas period 2014, 45,000 workers were recruited.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start applying this month and that the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, send, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons too.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat is empty next to me, and it's becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the future" had premieres 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the biggest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year-old conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the margins of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls, it didn't work (yet) yet.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two-digit area, and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's too early in the election period.
No one claims Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's lead was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of which won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's permanence and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP’s GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "satisfied" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "enraged" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "inspired" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "enraged" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters who are serving the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is valid in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly hats, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
If they are asked who most wins the GOP nomination, according to a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it is evident that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even when Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the splitted field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
But a survey by the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trimp fans say they formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "violent" the immigration point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression of decisive Hispano-Americans will be kept away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do too.
The frustration about the government climbs to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Mondays survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa republicans were frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, were "unsatisfied" with 54 percent and 21 percent "heavy angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," says the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows the special locations in which one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student base in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top places, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
Property service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing locations - with square meters prizes in dwindling heights.
There are several tens of thousand euros - per square meter, well noted.
But well, who can afford it ...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goal shooter in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller opened the way to the FC Bayern to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to "Mission Milan" in the hexenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their start in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in series is expected to be the first step towards final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
Müller received generous help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th match in the Champions League, which had one of the world champions shot as a flanked thought.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichs kept word.
They showed a focused and committed idea without glistening.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, unbeatable in seven European cup games with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They took courage to work on their offensive efforts, but often to no avail.
The attacks were too often launched by a shift to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely went through the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more happiness from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria used to raise her dominant game, Piraeus could set needlesticks.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was abandoned.
Like when he led a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola had a quadruple chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, back in the cadre after some musculoskeletal problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup Held did not give any green light until after the final training, said Chief Sports Officer Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "He who wants to make something else out of it, that's already malicious".
At the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, and Müller put one on it by Elfmeter.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces seized and went with knocks against the Munich followers.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes, thereby harms not only the lung, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In the event of a failure, the risk is falling quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers risk losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammations of the gum, the DifE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of gums in smokers.
The extent to which smoking also increases the risk of caries is not clarified.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, stated first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE said, "Smoving shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, leads to good dental health up to the high age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supported the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologneer Rheinufer for remains from the late antiquity
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum of Skelette and remains of historical buildings excavated, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always added as a professional office for Archaeological Ground Monumental Care.
In the third section of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress was established and in the 8th century a church, Trier explained.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the direction of the railway station building at the end of the railway platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, she carried the most serious injuries of it.
She was treated in emergency care on site and sent to a hospital by rescue staff.
There are no findings on the reason for the nocturnal crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inhabitants or passersby of Linderen Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Notes that reveal the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hotline of the federal police under phone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute over the proposed Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private dispute settlement facilities between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system to which the citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish proposal is to bring the proposal into the free trade talks with the US as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced support.
With TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU States and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the USA and third countries in the same way.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
Up until now, the parties to proceedings had agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposition against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own details.
There could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries, for example.
The investor-state dispute (ISDS) procedures, in particular required by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for Europe's major resistance to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies contest damages from taxpayers, remove national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission is taking into account important points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel has drawn up in spring with other EU Ministers for Trade.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the business opportunities by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it was said.
When discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) Free Trade Agreement could be concluded, Wednesday continued to be unclear.
Negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not, however, been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be unsustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seventeen years ago Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his minor and delicately arranged songs, based on various places that he always records on the map.
Where they came from and what it looks like in his home country.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative fool.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003 and released cleverly composed songs, which harmoniously close to American folks of the late 1960s, but can always drift into great opulent drifts.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a mediocre series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and close to the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking positive certain expectations.
- Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live satisfy him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York musician returned to the series.
In 2005, Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise, "Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise".
Overcrowded with ideas and stylistic fines.
The album goes into the American Billboard Charts and does not lack any annual best of the influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic differences.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
The stage shows will be a colorful spectacle made of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage denco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently serving as part of a five-member band through Germany.
In the dark Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although there are now nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs, the significantly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
One hears from the audience: The lecture is "opulenter" and it allows the "platte to be thrown away basically".
It's only for an addition that Steven thanks modestly, plays acoustically a few older songs and eventually bows down under oscillating applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns Debut has been eagerly expected at the question time of the Prime Minister.
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister's hour of questioning and start working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour delegates from nearby.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman to maintain in silence a number of Tory MPs during the singing of the National Hymne during a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism of a number of ToryMPs and is at the heart of several cover stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to itself
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he had been "in respect of silence" and he recognized the "herotry of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr. Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since being Tory Chief, over the dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's question time is too confrontational, and that he will be left behind both "satisfaction" and the fight with renunciation, instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of Economics Minister, will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the Unterhaus, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater" that is often linked to the Prime Minister's question time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the underhouse and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics argued that she had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Boss in Joburg: homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tricky place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge(er-)schossen) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos from their surroundings and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has hit one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound jumped according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom's wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, without bonuses in the United Kingdom, earnings grew by 2.9% over the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most rapid assessment since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the takeover offer of Rival AB InBev had been received.
One transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
According to encouraging news, Burberry shares were 0.9% higher from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again growing.
Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he took $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment on "sales" for the company Rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years young, a faggot with a hairy hair.
The type with the platinum blond hair is 100 million euros hard.
More than that.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is moving.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the poly is sitting on the cold stone plates form Berliner luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here is her idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "My victoria would actually have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
School duty?
Who's hunting?
The fans don't.
Not even beeber itself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the complaints in the advertising break of the Superbowl, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window.
He's supposed to have exploited more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that beeper is finally just in the USA and the UK with its new single "What do you mean?" to 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not interest the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanese on potato-dark idea
Potatoes or diners?
It goes both - in the potato döner developed by the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "Cartaffe instead of Döner" on a poster of Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffs instead of Döner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, his shop has had a barbecue pot that is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has since been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a utility model, according to the Authority's information.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to betray how much meat and how many potatoes of the spear contain.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Also with its customers, the culinary understanding of the people is well received.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to combat aldi seizures
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media, as well as through events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
It is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA loads and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will remove around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and remove sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $million of sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that the next year, Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and the volume of metcash's high fixed cost could cost Metcash about $13 million of profit before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time as sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler refuses and invests more than $150 million in order to balance sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and better choice of private label food.
Metcash's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and shop renovation programs will be made to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "coldilateral damage" in his recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is called "Special Ks" again and again, came to the spotlight by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery skill game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the arbitrator twice, with Harrison calling out: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen to destroy a tennis racket after a spatman had a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup finale against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm really interested in is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been put in a little battle," said Healy.
He broke a blower when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a flier of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too strictly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the changing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First, we wish the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He goes up in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I consider appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and took off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one's country, responding to Serbian officials with indignation.
The people who fled from violence stood for an unknown time in a stripe on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants "open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian volunteer police.
Some have returned from protest food and water.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister stated that it was “inacceptable” for migrants to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels one day after the 28-nation block.
The ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, at the end of the month or by the end of the year, the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on a prompt action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also planned the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not refugees entitled to protection - an opinion strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence that the government had built up along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also lay down higher prison sentences for condemned traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are preparing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Rosske, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and to push a crowd into it.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to take a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to run for the presidential office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the electorate.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost some profits in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only with 5 points back.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the electoral elections state that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would be enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked on an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time a woman became president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and electability is also quoted.
As the Vice-President casts a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the electorate want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids is at the forefront.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead will rise before Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this number has fallen of 78 percent last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement by far, but the percentage that he sees as the "most elected" has risen.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about voteability.
Like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the electoral elections.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features in voters of the electoral elections of their party.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off with the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as a foreign minister, most democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this issue was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent consider them honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters across the country also regard Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are best suited for honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The sample error rate of 351 democratic voters in the selections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets up at national survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support grows of 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well placed in demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the surveys - he is landing at 19% support from Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a carson rising last week, Trump found a few lateral hubs for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Although peaks are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vacationers is enough to find even hot water.
A bath in North or Baltic Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German weather service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east they even reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood in charge of the death of a Baruch College Nebula
Almost two years after a student died during a painful ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, morgrins are filed against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with connected eyes, and were repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Finally, Mr. Deng complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng was disarmed and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, to goggle his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began hiding utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be relived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, torso and thighs with a dull force.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the schizophrenia. At least one student has died every year since 1970 on the Schicans," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree charge for murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with a criminal union because of disgraceful attacks and the formation of a criminal union.
"We not only want to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will also get it to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership to the local group.
This will happen if Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will wake up, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna last and how long it'll last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement of an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, presumption of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency for asset gains to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed's interest increase.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has been mostly on the upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to an increase in interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with an average return on the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chef Plant-Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tended to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed increases its interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only twice been nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed data.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
All year round, market participants focused on a Fed's increase in interest rates, and all eyes were focused on the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting this week, which ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all increases cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing growth in GDP and put pre-recession heights in the shade very quickly after the beginning of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far it has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatility, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase/down in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer concentration of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed's strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
Largely, companies that carry out the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will suffer worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts.
"History shows that "quality-" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Businesses with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher earnings, even if experts differ in their opinion how fast that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the sender for his "dummation"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament-Collection Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private stations do not do.
Conservativeman Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio station was "dead" and is increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 does not seem - I do not like to use the word "dum" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC General Director rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lay far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, new music and commissioning new works, I also think it really is important," he said.
At the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to employ the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, was in favour of kicking down the commercial rivals.
The Tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC manner".
He added that he wished the company "found a hit from our own stable" when it next started a entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has slowed the issues in November
Virtual shopping has been booming for over a decade, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He stated that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth is falling.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers to make their beaks shredded around their computers, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers fought for beaks, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £ issues were spent a little more than 1 £ online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse to the burden of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mecca's big mosque.
Mourning filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days before, a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the prayers.
The bodies were released for funeral, when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the Bin Laden family building company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beavers who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the State-owned Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was banned from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the crash of the crane that fell into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which took place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not actual security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded by Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abductive son, who was abducted by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (€ 174,000) be paid to the victims and the same sum of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationally
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes.
If you can deal with a hammer or brush skillfully to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because British people increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices has been outnumbered.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops aimed at artisans and close 60 B&Q sales outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shop purchase decisions are made by women.
At the moment the men are overthrew by the employees.
She said it was necessary to stand up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to shift this more strongly to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British FTSE100 Index, has also re-designed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a fall in the half-year profit and sales after the group trained the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for Infidelity in Court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion on Wednesday.
The defendants did not know guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
From this accusation he was legally declared in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had been crystallized that the defendants used funds from association accounts over which they were allowed to dissponsive in their functions for private purposes from 2006 to 2011.
He's doing the damage with around 400,000 euros.
The sports officers are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was rejected by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later stage.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense indicated that the association had not at any time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials would only have paid for damages and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 Schilling (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Do we continue the club or do we lock the club?" said one of the defendants, in the bread company, large-scale auditors of the tax office.
With his colleague and fellow defendant, he then decided to take up this task.
With all the risks.
"We put up money, our life insurances as security at the bank," he said at the time of the receipt.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it can only not be made debts.
In the event of such financial success, the disbursement of expenses had also been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the damages were paid out only years later, starting from 2003 when an increase had been on the account.
Therefore, the former Obmann also appeared to be a flat-rate and not detailed settlement, explaining the operations.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
Why the disbursements had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in detail in the financial agreement, but was important only to the freedom of debt, according to the reply.
When in 2011 against the one official investigation due to official abuse began, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants declared.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondents did not know any answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put it into the room.
The fellow defendant had been informed, the officer justified.
This transfer was formulated as "damage compensation".
Why compensation for damages?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant claimed that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor with this."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never paid a cent salary, he paid only kilometers of money and diets.
He paid 1,000 euros per month to diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be filed by the defendants.
They were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything had been judged as correct, they explained.
Kilometer money had also come up with the second defendant.
All the resolutions were made in cash, to which he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Leiburg, he stated in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard deletes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been in progress for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The strike marks for the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers' business.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will result in a special burden of approximately $2.7 billion, which will take place from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
The Hewlett-Packard share was 2.3 percent.
The large-scale group from Palo Alto, California, is currently split up: The computer and printer business is supposed to be bundled even more today in a new society, separate from the more future areas with computer servers and data stores for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second-largest PC manufacturer, Lenovo, was the last to add a new disappointment to PC sales as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services.
In the third quarter of the business to the end of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This reduced revenue in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP answers the change in the industry with a split-up and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only recently responded that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans total the reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the Anti-IS training mission
However, direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would be largely opposed: 54 percent were opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states fly air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to interfering with the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian power holder Bashar al-Assad reject 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair is on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Connecting Mobility" on Thursday.
The public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors as they were two years ago.
Röszke:outbreak of violence at Serbian-Hungarian border
At the Serbian border near Röszke, the Hungarian police employed tear gas and watermelter against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
After that, a police line had formed and behind the police there was an aquifer ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks, and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials started using pepper spray without interruption.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed toward the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have moved back a little while ago.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas scream.
Other refugees fell in themselves and were suffering from breathing.
Also, the press speakers of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank
The world watches when the U.S. bond bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade interest is raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still last week's view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision to be taken at 8 p.m. on Thursday
Death Protector at Delta State University left Sorry
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed him later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was "a pity" at the first murder and wanted "he could make it wrong," announced authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency call number around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call centre staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house but that "no one will bother", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Billiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were made 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destructiond to the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prardiss.
Knowles said that Prardiss who owned a dog called Lightning have met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in spring 2015 as his laziness indicates on the University's website.
Stars that have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought for leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
I'm sure that's what he's asking for.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa plans to build a large group of companies.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and values Eurowings' cheap daughter.
The objective of the realignment was a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and proceeds synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings for the management team of Chef Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the conflict of tariffs with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are due to be resumed after the strike stopped in court on Thursday.
That's what the union announced.
The topic of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible in a year with a forecasted record result.
The conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the concept of "Wings" is a background.
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa provides for the transfer of routes to the Eurowings group's own low-cost line.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this has brought the left defender to cry and will exclude him for at least six months from playing, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operating in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the changing cabin.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had erred.
You can judge for yourself if I say an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw’s account said: “I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery is starting now, I come back stronger.”
Regarding this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he had touched [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Plenty, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book, instead reflects a content description of the 2012 film version, adding the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this was not yet suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Even though he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book's act. Here, an unnamed boy, as the local environment, is heard by the money-loving, tree-slaughtering, thin-strengthed once-ler, despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, a horrifying, snoring being, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3.0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an away victory.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars of 2012, just a teen-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for attack.
Related Message: Adam Lyth separates from the England test box and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to abandon Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze as his head trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, there - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickout.
Long ago Lyth's course had been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopes to beat out further runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and I am not surprised; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test slagman gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly value.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw early in this season at Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which met us very much.
He must get at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this depends, of course, on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil's guy from cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before playing as an opener in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred runs and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spider, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me as a young man.
People may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in harmony with the previously spoken ones.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used for the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team actors do not set the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily in the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brext = exit of the UK from the EU) could win off if the economy gets into a fluute by the year 2017
David Cameron's untapped new negotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU is going to be more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or TUC, who is violently trampling down because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always based on their own debt, UK itself, are filled with split concessions and disruptive changes in contracts that they do not want to change most of the time.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like them to risk social protection either.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes a Britain looking outside within the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened to the exaggerated long endurances like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear out a leg to help the selfie britches whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may deliberately not even plan helpful comments, quite in the SNP style, while UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pleite" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunists who made a name as an "EU-Gerade bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hooking foreigners and the pseudo non-nationals who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similar to her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortex, for Blair had laid the principle of the EU's unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never left him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, a mistake back then and today.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development - I'd like to say it kindly.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips' traditional blue-colored tendency and the wilder threaded by Tory's Small Englandnism can probably all say yes.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week when the pathfinder in him fought not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be informal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor did JC tell his fellow fighters and parliamentarians according to all the reports at their plenary session on Monday evening.
Whatever the sad bottom-up image of Corbyn - remember that he has touched even me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the struggle of the social media, a breeding site of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to support Labour in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental multiplicity of EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multilingualisms on Nato - Tom Watson is strongly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I started on Monday of something that was called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticise Public Health England Report on e-cigarettes
Proclaims from a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as a "wide review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "externally windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "constructed on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the best estimate at present is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who have been called up to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDA) to lead to a synthesis of their opinions on the damage of various nicotine containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was previously to receive funds from British American Tobago (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that they had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which include industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco guide also participated in the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significant" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were a way to smoke for children or serve non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had already been responded before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies on his search.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not riskless, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs, probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and from stations such as BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or sent, which would also clearly be shown by non-subsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to pay the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others don't make or order.
They send The Voice in an excellent time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be financed, even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for this.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think this would actually reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was indebted to hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his MacTaggart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like EastEnders sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should go "to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting charges, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscene programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
At the broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions which can best be valued from this.
Of course you all think we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 CEO David Elstein, who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "information, form and entertain".
He said that little of BBC's production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio - and it should be an example to the public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to "informed, clarify and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the proms, of which he said only a handful is shown on television and deal with commercial stations alliances to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction of the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasonics can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Serekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-heir stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fad worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic shafts affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed worms so that some of their motoneurones carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When using ultrasonic to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms where they switch on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic tissues can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

The Ads Shame Britain's Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Watch trade fair video.
Horrible killer drones!
Foot joint crushing leg-belts!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government's willingness to make weapons to repressive regimes about the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in underground trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the letter types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a ware of arms dealers will ride with DLR ... Customers will be asked to help at the stop of the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ pack of inbus keys that claims that "access to around one third of the bus stops commercial areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another anti-weapon trading platform greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitably with the graphic and voice-over artist, who also works for free.
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that existed around advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, twilight corporate advertising, but "by extinguishing with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a move by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be handled illegally before our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are making fantastic euphemistic products enshrouded.
In a press release, Sab reveals an order from the US Army on "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes an "uniquely shaped battle head that provides outstanding aftereffect effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those whom I have annoyed - and the numerous, long - breathed complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's seductive to swap: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "very said Marmite doesn't love or hate because in serious, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find the people you like unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers would be.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and put on their underwear.
In terms of this, don't think of starting at university with a relationship
Introverted people receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room chat culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy that I've used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a community is exhausted by sociality - and send it a text message instead of knocking.
Apply apropos: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-manie, knocking at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions."
Homemade treats offer is a good way to close friendships.
Their fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the dairy owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my fellow resident who added a dish to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make any noise, keep people from sleeping or from working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the saying you belong to the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it mattered to them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly left her neighbors to sleep for two hours before having their own music looted, closed their door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence?
On the other hand, it would not be abject embarrassing if you held a fellow resident for your future spouse, rang at them, separated themselves again, and then they would have to see each day and perhaps live with them as she passes over all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, at least you try to talk a little sense of reason to your lower body.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unsealed room, the border between a uk and mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never spoil anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tack their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single parents, low-income workers
The real estate operator Markus Gildner is building in the Eckental Eckental in central France for people who don't have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single parent and the low-earners."
"I show how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to create cheap housing quickly: he builds in a project assembly houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will press the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The vast accommodation in containers or gymnastics has no sustainability.
For the people remain here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we need enough housing in the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-storey house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are just built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'll go back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I worked correctly in construction law.
It always makes the threatening damocles heavy special construction and the parking regulation particularly complicated.
It's horrible.
It is still subject to who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is a lack of space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the locals react to their Reigenhaus project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which definitely is not right.
But don't you tighten up the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a building tree in Germany over the past five years, but were built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low earner.
I'll show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that indicates that the "software update failed".
In order to deal with the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the storm goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by weakening the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool, delete apps, and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is recharged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half-way and this could lead to a failure of the update.

You should also make sure that you have looked through our checklist of all things before you download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's Only Currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg has only one more motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his well-leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup-second stressed before starting the decisive seven overseas race, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the Vizeweltmeister before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defenders and dual champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and has also taken the Flutlicht Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, founded three months ago, "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the director of the German Merit Cross, 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot raise the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent-seeking should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his closeness with the spa town.
Quartiers office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to discussions, you can also take part in courses.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More precisely to the Graf Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was opened there recently.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will receive from now on seniors and advisers information on questions such as care insurance or health insurance services.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have found that often caring family members are left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"In addition, many services of the funds are not rarely used because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for Antonistift and the Civic Hospital as the business manager for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiers office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis were taken into the boat for this purpose.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and reha.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre is that both managers are particularly interested in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the initiation celebrations, the quarter office also dedicated itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The Quartiers office is open Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9am to 14pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4am to 6pm and Saturdays from 10pm to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the deadline for the FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third leagueist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set because of the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth finale of the Bavarian Football Totopocal against the third leagueist FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7 pm at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game goes over stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched pre-sale of cards.
It's something special for our team to play against a third league player.
We therefore hope for numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special attraction.
In the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional leagues 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualified for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.

Wiener Architektur Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but he has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the treasure chamber in Vienna's Hofburg and to rebuild the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese casts police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unwell noticed in Bremen.
Football was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-Nationaltorhüter is engaged in Germany and Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement, has increased in the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not grow.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city center just as he saw an outside parking guard putting out a penitentiary for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw her the due fine in front of her feet, as the "image" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in the test," it says from the city of Bremen.
It is only after that that it will be decided whether or not Wiese will be shown.
Panaman authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the flourishing of the marijuana plants.
For three days Panama's authorities have been ripping out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at about 23.45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres, according to police reports, calling them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men then shouted at the young people and struck them face-to-face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was very bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends came and conspired to the beater, he left off his victim at first.
From his friends, the injured young man was now taken home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and went there several times demonstratively.
When the vehicle was not seen, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the butcher and another male.
With the aid of a impact stick, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be hospitalized for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second butcher was about 1.65 metres tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and notifiers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongolll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann, business sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still half-placed in the next few months.
After a conversion phase Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, who currently completed her medical training at the Verden Hospital and plans to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in with this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it happened, I just called them."
The Muller couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany families over the years."
As an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the twofold family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He currently works as a senior physician in Sulingen and was also appointed a senior emergency doctor in 2009 in Diepholz County and is an honorary member of the DRK Department of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice is prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen is working as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internistin) specialises in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as a house doctor.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongolll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are to continue the practice," emphasizes Samtgemeinde Citizens' Champion Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongolll, about 2,000 patients come into the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, with an average of about 500 in North German practice.
There is another medical practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller's speech hours continue to see familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, doctors practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers smirking.
After a long time, she felt a little tired.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will probably see many patients many times," says the intern.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"Unfortunately I've always pushed myself to gardening, now that could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being raised at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so "of course".
Human care and security are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "there is a need for clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia considered "Cororror" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and may also set up corridors for refugees.
However, she did not see this interior minister Vesna Györkos Znidar in Liège.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify border surveillance, especially in Hungary.
However, the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin does not want to block his borders on refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkos Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been in constant contact with Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It mainly deals with Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will reach with about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would reroute towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media agreeing on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government, however, contended that it was the fact that it was a way of showing people how to take certain routes: "We can either, nor do we want to do this," it was called.
According to the media reports, in the early days a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, while more buses were expected to take place during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were traveling all night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometres away through Serbia.
"We heard Hungary closed up, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could in fact lead to the projected shift of the previous Balkan route to Turkey-Greece-Macedon-Serbia-Hungary, which was already predicted by observers, to a somewhat further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control"
Croatia's Minister for the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member had "wide possibilities for border control".
There are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007, and since then the EU partners have been giving a good witness to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local eyelight in Horgos: he considered the debates about alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is closed now, to be premature.
At present, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey about Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are registered.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: In parts of the border area, there are still unraveled mine fields 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minerooms was sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of getting an insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information collected is intended to allow insider businesses to be made on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this means that a total of over 100 million dollars have been won.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused people lasted in the case.
Most of the defendants came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around Mannheim's Paradeplatz, there is a regular operation.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozyly roaring.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
The city's railways.
Pulsating life with beautiful autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four large plates each with the heading "Before I die I want to"....
The ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of Ecumenical Hospic Assistance is available to passersby as well as to questions and conversations as to the volunteer staff.
While some of them spontaneously take a passerby to the Kreide and check the sentence for "my life", "can read", "with the camper driving through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others remain short, read, say sentences like "I am not yet that far" and then continue.
Time and again, small discussions on the action itself, on life, on the handling of death develop.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that the end comes to this world for me at some point, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the director of the Ecumenical Hospic Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old was good.
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables is understandable, but ultimately it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death remains with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people.
An assessment which Angelika shares Godefroid.
The dying and mourning companion is one of the first-hour volunteer staff.
When confronted with the subject by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospic Aid sought honorary help by calling, she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary - 43 women and two men - the affected person and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle their task and the experiences and experiences involved.
"I see the life of another waiting, think it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulatory Ecumenian hospice service is free and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of members and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of dying and mourning companions.
Training courses for new employees are offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook to a year-round due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $1.40 and $1.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite the increase in prices, which is an average of 4.9 percent and which will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases for ground transport of heavy and large parcels which will be raised from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and because of growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "solid yields revenue if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, for example the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve of Zacks Investment Research surveyed analysts predicted.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years, which has made sales in its unit express shipping stagnating.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, floor transport revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $1150.15.
On Tuesday it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve will spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: to keep the maximization of US employment and prices stable here.
But since the great recession the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be depleted from the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they are growing solidly, recent turbulences on global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, what in itself is uncertain about the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a fall in the stock market if Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the strike by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average was 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed's policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they would not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow strengthening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and in early summer that despite the complaints of liberals, despite the fact that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wages increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the central bank's 2 % annual target, Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world snapped together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May fell below its peak by more than 16% when investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would cause global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former member of the U.S. Notenbank.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better under control.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed currency authority has become the world's.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "close" their monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabel, head of the global strategy for asset management at Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "as a result of limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA," said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Board for interest fixing.
The most recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are rising," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think that it should press ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market, which also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/stock is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes more than an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking room (good and cheap) in this shop is close to the checkouts and has various take-away options.
What there is: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably did.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat bar is extensive, as is the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and fill the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and galle, swine natural arm, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide courses are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, together with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small relief for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Making a warm welcome to you does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer assistants.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who support inadvertently asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with a body and soul.
She still loves teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different lessons than at a real school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is shockingly trying to inform women about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother’s milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research indicates that higher calorie intake is not the only dietetic adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernried Sports Hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flattered for solar system.
The plans for long-awaited gymnastics at the Bernrieder Sportplatz are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction request was unanimously cancelled without major discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, an application for an "exception" of respectable "liberation" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Thus, a "saddle roof with non-middle first and roof overlay" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderful large south roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "liberation" was about the inclination of the roof, which, for energetic reasons, is to be less than ten degrees - than required in the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roof inclination does not allow "exceptions" - although the Bernried local council normally is rather restrictive in applications for liberation.
However, the tunnel construction project is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent case", says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost.
Grants are expected from school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step, the construction request for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted for examination to the Landratsamt.
Peißenberg Hospital is moving to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - that is, 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district have confirmed the Landratin Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision was taken by the Supervisory Board, and next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The vast majority were to move with fishermen and the existing internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot join Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schungau Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now changing to private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who is to take up the succession, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in every case a "enhancing" and a spread of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schungau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological disorders at the internal station.
A transitional period for the next two years, when the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses, the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landraat Jochner-Weiß, who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, found rumors about the future use of the house owned by the federal staff as accommodation for asylum workers.
As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say there are several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatric care.
"What better things couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity doesn't come again," said Fischer about the Quasi move to the Lech, who had been accepted by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There was no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schugauer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required this evening at the Bergische HC.
The Federal League's leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but no one has any reason to be overly oblivious.
In the past season, the Badeners at the BHC suffered a painful defeat and have something to do with it.
Hunger accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon shots.
During the Abernten on a Maisfeld near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in service as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could come to the accident was at first unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence Crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds who have been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing young people and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz who was missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, who, according to the evidence, stood the act and led the investigators to the site of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had come home as agreed on the eve of a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal objects of the victim.
In the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was finally a suspicion against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the police question, the prisoner admitted the authorities to have killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the detainee on Wednesday, the investigators would put him to death.
Note about the closer circumstances of the act is intended to carry out further investigations.
Refugees Need Accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable stays.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
The result is a study on behalf of the "Social Housing Association".
For comparison: this year, 260.000 units will be completed in Germany.
It lacks 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many then come to the housing market and enter the long snakes in front of the rentals.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is sending out an apartment deficit that is growing from year to year.
At present, some 770,000 housing units were already missing in the conurbation areas, lamented Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained in the "Hotel Mama" for involuntarily longer because of the flauute on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a reboot.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
Thus, the basic employment tax could be waived and the basic tax for funded housing could be suspended temporarily.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The refugee housing programme of the state bank KfW is already well suited to cities and communities.
A good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros had already been reached more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free community: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary is practically no more transit, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia intends to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees broke up to Croatia to get there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can go through and we prepare for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU’s Nachbar Country of Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as by taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees did not meet border fences.
There are other dangers for this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Miners are now expected to create a safe passage quickly.
After the closure of the border, however, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people.
Just before the gate close on Monday it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws take the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The defendants are threatened with imprisonments for up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established transit zones, of which almost all - 93 - were at the most important crossing of Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there.
In practical terms, however, no one has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lock grids were dismantled and one of the pick-up bearings in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
Austria will reach only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary has been closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government instructions.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the order of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "Stanned" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had stopped train transport with Austria surprisingly on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was concluded in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drivered the beaches together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Before that, we have first seasoned the unspoiled guests with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll take her to Passau by car.
"This was natural for us," Stadler said in the OÖN speech.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very happy," Stadler said.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau, in order to try across the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic was closed to Germany.
The regional train was placed before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, tags before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends further zigthousons to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to set up structures to ensure humanity, our Chancellor has made the Hungarian government's attitude into the dark circle of National Socialism, highly official and publicly.
These policies are not just those which are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also need to find that the "beggar country" they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the near winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35.000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also done without a big vortex, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad calculates with a demand of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, there are 35,000 accommodations to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If it is to become more refugees, we can manage it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the chiefs of the state.
These would have assured him to also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP manual supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help Like Us".
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodations.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be that quarters are required to maintain a certain height of towel holders or size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "Notstandards" would have to apply.
As opposed to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad was more successful with his experience.
I am an older man, to whom one does not simply say the untruth.
Its most important weapon was persuasive force.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four.
Their own quarters search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
The city of Linz plans not to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, further sites should be checked for their flexibility.
The chief of the city criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: "Greens are not locked off"
On Monday, on a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state captain Josef Pühringer (VP) has agreed to the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
The transit of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there have been border controls in this respect.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the first time.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
For Pühringer "a logical consequence" from the action of the Germans, Austria is now also carrying out checks at its borders again.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT Group S&T is incorporated, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring whatever.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
1,7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is rented from Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented, and 40 per cent of all requests are available.
Lia-Peroni-intaker opened second business in the Arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to take a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to move to the pigeon market arcade in a short time: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business venue.
In the Furla shop opposite the store where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything is about women's handbags from the Furla brand, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks have been rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking about opening a store for a long time," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was that Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also concerned with the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has received Breit from her mother.
I do the most when something develops and I can show new trends at manageable prices.
Why so many women get in decoration when looking at a beautiful handbag, even the specialist woman can't answer with last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag is upgrading every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The peacock ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the promoter.
This property also links some with the billionaire who wants to become the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exhilarators.
Whether he is a stranger, a journalist or a lack of knowledge in international crisis policy, the candidate for the U.S. Presidency is a strong force in the campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Polish Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the wine village on Weinstraße.
Some of them in the 1200-inhabitant place are related to more than ten corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
Simone Wendel's call cityman filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadter has filmed an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous poppies, among whom, besides Trump, the ketchup family Heinz also counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also spoken in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, it is also tending to believe that Trump is "a bit of a grandmaul," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the circle, "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the sponsors, she says.
Trump thus comes from the village of the sponsors.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather immigrated and opened a site for gold graves in the United States.
The real estate group was based on first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he once left without permission, but the director of the Institute for Historical History and People's History, Roland Paul, had declared him a film launch.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the progeny.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the poltert does, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trump ("The granny was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement sees the American more dissociated, "he's always so exhilarating."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared for Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions how some Kallstadters mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ on a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They feel better if he doesn't know the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the say in the U.S. during his grandfather's time had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerstor Sarah Bühler.
What about President?
"My president is not," she says.
And: "The grapes will mature without the President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, including in the US the interest awakens.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergfüferdorf".
From the hand of the vice president at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 resident village in Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there has been no major shifts in today's reviews.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rival Sunrise, with David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television programmes in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397.000 spectators among the five capital cities, compared to today 339.000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained below that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 in comparison to the 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the review!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently bewildered father who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor from Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 h) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 am to 18:00) spread to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas for the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that Hot-Seat will last at 5:30 pm.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars that didn't manage to overwhelm McGuire's show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed in Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was held in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether it is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before getting out of three two, you may accidentally have given a hint who the winner will be.
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed to the finale on Thursday
All three women were lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Wood's last Rose?", their answers to the game corruption could become who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavon's fellows.
"Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made her aware that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now reserved for him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after their impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers had banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a range as he did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertition at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also to the running game after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding the mills before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his past catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point restored in the first game district from the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut had hoped for.
Hayne left after the fumble fluking the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass led to a try for Queensland in his own in-Goal area.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posing for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of the gay
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rollerfield with armed force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, seized his oil company Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Chief Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbstklausur in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"At least we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag Group of Free Elections meets in the Lower Franconian Community until Friday.
In fact, quite different main topics were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Elector Meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overshadow the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"That's not how it's going, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Elector Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to move the Free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards across Germany."
"Bayers are moving off, others aren't."
"There we need to become more able to act."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt is not to be brought under the table.
A permanent burner for years remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new year of schooling, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot "middlegrad plus" at 47 Gymnasia, where an extension of the secondary gymnasial level is tested from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to the Abitur again.
But that's not far enough Aiwanger.
"The topic G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasies who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shot rubber shots at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shot into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in Rupandehi District on Tuesday night, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhaka, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhaka said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before she grabbed rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, of which they are known to be able to kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city

Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System Building", presented its plans publicly for the first time in the city development committee of the Elder Council on Monday evening.
This item had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the hotel were blatant reactions to seabuden owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenbeowner and Executive Board member in the interests of the trailers, Pro Hive, complains: "This is going to be a giant plot that exceeds all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like some other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly by the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to be calculated," says Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the well-sized area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Zwillings-Nachwachs bei Gorillas im Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about young people at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian still holds them closely on the body.
At first, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a broad low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts doubling donations campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign that will raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they flee from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who escaped from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
Donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, torn by war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to eat.
Over the years, adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas-chirurgy - stomachbypass and stomach hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes disease and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely eliminated only at one percent and in some cases only at about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure controls, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
According to the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, it remained stable in the medical therapy group at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass-Chirurgie group had lost more weight compared to the gas trektomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and reported a more complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone says from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was less likely to die in obese people undergoing adipositas surgery than in a group that tried more conventional methods over the course of 15 years.
Although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies firmly to obesity and diabetes, conversion is really difficult."
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It's a topic that is currently becoming increasingly observable in Belletristics: a young woman, unloved and unsightly at school times, after years meets the flock of her youth again, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the novel "We're not really like this" by Luisa Binder, published recently.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set her home location a literary monument.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not welcome all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comppassion in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but that the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Looking for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing in their countries is being reduced.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the September 11 terrorist attack and found that the US's violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11th, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children over the last 4 years
Gift control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of income from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a taste in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water in order to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be lured by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain alcohol somewhere between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially for small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the venomous call centre at the University of Kansas, station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a slug of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in reach of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four syringes of hand disinfectant fragrance after strawberry in school, was taken to an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency drug that treated her outside of Atlanta at the Gwinnett Medical Center.
Nhaijah called her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and shot her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers take advantage of alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, unexplained ingredient.
Health professionals suspect that the product contained methanol is a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by presenting antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banished her from her room.
The police considered the irrigated plan to be "conjugations" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in the event of a run-up accident on the crossroads between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards the district of the industrial area and realized too late that two previous vehicles had stopped at the traffic.
As a result, he collided with his truck to the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
In the case of the accident-involved vehicles, damage to property amounted to around EUR 10 000, the police report.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer running and had to be dragged off.
Geruchteküche: No disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA for accusation of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious with January New Commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre
Dons increase leadership over Celtic at five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, making the dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talking about disharmonie
There are rumours about disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which has been spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team companions are not under increased control because they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of competition for title in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rituality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, which now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points of advantage.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to go on.
We really need, really, the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Getting together is so important.
Warburton carefully on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which pointed out that he had a few January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
The ex-head of Brentford said: "The January-Transfer window is very different from the summer-window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expired.
For two years, the 29-year-old has been teasing himself with a bothering ankle and has not made the finish from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle for Neilson's comments posted
The Hearts ran 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Map of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said and insists, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was reproved after he admitted to singing a song with provocative lyrics about ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in March 2014 in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said, adding, "It is certain that I will not return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things off - but insists that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna get these guys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight with Hamilton Accies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them an advantage of five points before Celtic on the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half time.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won everything in cup games or leagues who didn't win games of this kind either."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk people were bothering the process.
As security personnel could not justify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to guard the disturbances.
A respiratory alcohol test occurred at a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained in custody at first.
Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Some later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications available than places, there is a more affordable lottery to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
He who is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two and a half hours visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
Prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story, how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She admitted that "it could have been better formulated," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him for being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessarily.
Man after wet police flight hunt convinced to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police kept dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "swiftly persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to make a break of peace in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape from them toward Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too excited about wetting his uniform, so he turned on a more reliable tactics - "A good cop negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car into the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousin biathlon humorously.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and Integrity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were carrying out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching by Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt cup test at Lidaris that he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage accusations and did not want it to "seem like too high hanging grapes."
"I had planned not to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to bypass the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stable.
"An 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I'm going to call when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to believe I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly have held their noses because they failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moody, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should this make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the coach built up with the long-lasting cobalt study at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "put his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeating master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule as "laughter", after a package of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which broke against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to my leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
It was the same on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the racing day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you went too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia came from the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driver's flight and abandoned assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy beats against rivals for claims on ring struggles
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has referred to criticism of his player as "Agenda Set" by two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the Storm players "ring fighting" with his team during the high Storm victory at the Qualifying Final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely hidden note to the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the critique of two leading trainers on his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It's rising again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fighting when they beat us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s brought us the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this appears again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "spanish" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he was going to take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind to play football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I increase my confidence because they say these things because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher score than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks making and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the AAMI Park. Ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbier with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who might threaten a lifelong punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came across Vanuatu from South America and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his fellow defendants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a possibly life-long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was worried about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.
"After reading the ethical statements made by the two people, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he gave off his Australian and Serbian passport, reported daily to the police and held to an exit barrier from 18:00–06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus rips apart
On Tuesday evening, a truck driver was severely injured with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three involved trucks had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid turning left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident causer was completely broken.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked for over six hours until 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of unscrupulous images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping dog.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "appreciative" web searches that used terms to search for unscrupulous images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and then he "wanted to be a police officer to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a search - that he was addicted to fear people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophile.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the zitter and crying.
She then saw the unscrupulous pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment to have accepted unscrupulous images of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the conditions on January 25 of this year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his wrongdoing.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael shifted the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a deposit, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Schleuser deviates on small crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, allowed people to increase in smaller crossings
On the Austrian side, a spokesperson from the federal police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had walked over bridges and dams to the German side.
There they are received by federal politicians and forwarded to registration.
At the Munich Central Station, significantly more refugees arrived when compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, according to federal police statements.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8:00 a.m. alone, said one speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: An exit from Tropensturm "Henry" in the Southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of stormböen in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced its current flow of warm sea air into the country.
The strong depth is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled across the Atlantic in recent days by the Bermuda Islands.
Strong storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, only 60 to 90 kilometres can be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance Circle.
On Friday the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass makes it: every two years the car builders on the IAA show their new products.
In 2015, the compact cars are mainly moving, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in demand: approximately 28.1 per cent of new registrations were based on this segment alone in August, according to the Federal Motor Vehicles Office (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
To ensure that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra is not to become much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an entrance below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is initially only a five-door racer.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combination, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what will be done next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault will race the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and emphatically sporty GT version.
He is going to trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan depositor wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo motor and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
Sales launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshooter put their hands on the front section: Here the cooler grill was repainted and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons is reduced by a touchscreen, and Apple's CarPlay is integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-husband of the Tegel Court of Justice, who had been housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are, in principle, entitled to financial compensation when they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have been locked in too narrow spaces for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This made an ex-husband successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with a surface area of about five square meters between June and November 2009 at the Berlin-Tegel Justice Centre; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on his free foot, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability for the unworthy detention of the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and returned the case to it for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were relevant for compensation for the period in question, a compensation claim was granted.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a weakening of the legal protection of the personality".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of penitentiaries.
So they only told a prisoner in April because he was naked incarcerated in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, it is also unworthy of the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009.
The claimant was accommodated between 15 and 21 hours a day for over three months in a cell similar to the one in Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of personnel.
Therefore, prisoners are constantly imprisoned for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even the beating is supposed to have happened because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied because of a lack of young people, 19 are due to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create this"
Migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even able to accept a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can create this and we create it".
What is true of Germany conveys the following overview.
According to different forecasts, apartments are used between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estel Institute estimate) every year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housings come out of the rental agreement each year, and for these particularly affordable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the perspective of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housings would have to be created each year and for this the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research estimates that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be active in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation criticises.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Dränhardt.
According to Dränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was an earlier ban on asylum seekers from up to five years of age, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the obligation of residence to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also because of the lack of skilled staff - most of them have taken the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is lack of German skills.
There is not yet a sufficient offer of general and vocational language courses.
In addition, studies show that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Dränhardt, the royal path to labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to Kitas, estimated at ten to 15 percent: "It is very important for the uprooted parents to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handlists in different languages.
The Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries students without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for the lessons.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, inner senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Refugees willing to study could be made easier to access the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerate will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Application Act when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive Bafög since they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this tension will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, requires Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play an important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop existing State Church law to a new state-religious relationship.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association, which is professionally concerned with the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control possibilities.
This also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to bring out such conflicts in Germany "have their right to stay here, in Germany, to perish," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
In future, integration will be much more than today a topic of society.
This will also require a change in the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series showed, systematically ignored the racist motif in the police and authorities.
The same opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and the groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the Anti-racism Convention Germany undertake must become real in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens' opportunities - for the good of all.
Germany is generally able to provide medical care for the refugees previously expected, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man's power and capacities are concerned, we can do that," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for all the arrivals to hand over health cards during registration.
Services provided could later be charged with the federal states.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Application Performance Act.
Otherwise, doctors are doing the most to create language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants are being treated worse than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, interpretation costs would have to be taken over, it demands.
However, a lot of refugees would already be in emergency ambulances with more general medical places.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and the young people are about HIV education.
However, with the partially other diseases, German doctors would be clear from their education, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize," and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualification and possibly carry out another examination.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates from the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with difficulty breathing, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent symptoms from being chronically chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
Up to now, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misconceptions, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Legienschaft" the Circus Prost draws attention to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to attract every age group in the banners of fascinating acrobatics, animal stress and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Legisance" - under this motto stands the current manegae production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily pride and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegencocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst's concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family takes over the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to take the Cuban duo looser.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Besides numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus Prost also fascinated with fingertips and jointness.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
The snakes are fascinating and startling at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Prostt also states: "If our animals are not good, we are not well".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each single sting.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly called, are read by the eyes at every request.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the manege either.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebra stand, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk, and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor, something is likely to happen.
"One thing is sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17th to 20pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is a family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has a false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a stage.
He remained intact, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
Parliament's opening was also bewildered by statements from Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with buahs.
Last month they paid him off and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them of disturbing Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't appear, but it has the title 'Tod'," he said after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of the restructuring and saving efforts of the company's services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing corporate hardware and its services operations.
The expected job loss leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in their transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will focus on providing previously unachieved integrated technology solutions for companies," says a statement from the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring process to deal with the rejection of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s measure, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Willshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given its history, its participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate knuckle injury and then found himself back to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the related risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, which have to mark most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break up," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has taken the lesson from last season with the Champions-League-Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven from the far-off hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked on Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, now has become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the man's year with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of "sound mood" friends, his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication via social media, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-loving and successful, even though isolation actually dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extreme values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beautiful thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments during football watches in cozy armchairs and the longing for Ross after Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of telephone soul care explained to me, "my hearing role for people who feel depressed and are self-killing has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I'm right with it" has a tremendous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why don't take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG move by to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2.0 victory against Malmö at the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they not only strive for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't achieve another one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which could hold a 2:2 difference in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was cast out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing tower was called the man who was able to take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmö defence before passing by Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on its own, with some mistakes and poor closures, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts was patted alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute on the pavement ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thinking that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention of Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was announced a goal at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifications games are not enough."
Get off in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through share sales
The Glencore mining giant, based in Switzerland, which is affected by falling raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its huge debt eradication plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is fighting with falling raw material prices, as China's economic downturn is pressing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to trade on early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Last week Glencore announced the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to eliminate around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares in 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term blocked growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, with coal, copper and other raw material prices falling by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon 49 people arrive after a mostly long escape from the city administration in Weimar.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis's first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan this evening at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xis will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial questions, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberspionage and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
Loose 440-PS sports cars and drove to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and lend himself to a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the Gotha district you can meet the dream and rent and drive one V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt the dream was then out and past.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports cars, went on wet lanes and went to the control board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern apparently stood a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer the 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the EM 2008 before his departure from Barcelona.
"They told me Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't do anything," he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Trummigge wanted me."
To the memory: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed with Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playing time would have been with Xavi in 2008/2009.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finale of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned the red out (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the Royal Class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown replied shockedly, with an insulted disbelief and called out "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of The Martian's actor strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the Harmony figure," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a noodle that's beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People was committed to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights in the film; Damon replied that her director could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in space, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved effect throughout the country and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color-based arrest.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (aleven still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasteilck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the big prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to finish.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's strenuous phase 4. However, Caldiero finished this challenge completely three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard fight victory, still under the shock of winning the big prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had a life," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, even though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money at all.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, he gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it receives great congratification.
I don't think he's got any grudges on it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are standing in the final place at the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game completely focused.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-piece hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has curved the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good while (slag training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he took it directly into play.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of coming back to play.
Center Field Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed over the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designed Rookie slagman Miguel Sano, who entriss the right-hand Drew Verhagen a Two-Run.
With a pair of runners and the final run on the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time leading in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, a RBI double was created against the closers of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, took Sano for his fifth save at three pizzas.
Detroit benefited at the beginning of the game from a Phil Hughes that was not yet moving.
The tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game, after having failed for more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Of course not the beginning I wished for," Hughes said, "but I felt better when I got started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first place, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game that created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center-fielder Anthony Gose to the 3.0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch Count, did not score any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever Right-Hander A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned because of an injury to the hounds.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the Sanchez shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder distortion, should be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has missed the right hip joint since August 20th.
The tigers and the twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5,4,4,73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in it should then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
It calculated from 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government presidium for the first time.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a way to be possible.
"I believe that the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking".
Four years ago we were glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is going on in front of our door," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, and no one was sent back to Hungary.
Germany did not return refugees to Austria either.
"No, this is so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and Representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete numbers and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22) the EU Ministers of Ministers want to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee order in Germany, the Federal Government is seeking to strengthen its support for the countries in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Mark underlined that those people who needed protection would also be able to do so.
However, anyone who does not have a long-term perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This view had been expressed in an impressive way in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to deal with a "massive effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs differently from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent tugs from seeking escape routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, Ophthalmologists have reportedly made thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturn's Enceladus, a global ocean wakes up.
This includes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Hence, the moon fluctuates slightly on its path around the ring planets.
Although this tumble movement is only small, yet too large for a consistently fixed heavenly body, it is stated in a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca (United States State New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south end of Saturn's moon, the water vapour and ice particles, and thus fed the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least there had to be an underground sea on the South Pole, closed the astronomers back then.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up approximately a month on open-air actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation had resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a hearty loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said Sport Director Necat Aygün of the "image" magazine, looking at the possible obligation of an ununifying professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties presented a defensive man at first.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was recently active in Belgium and was also signed with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat has currently "the opportunity to prove its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shaking next week.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will start running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) during a violent collision on the head.
However, contrary to first fears, he remained without a serious blessur.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain lots of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: in them put B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotin.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It reduces the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mango chutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS restores up to 95000 aids for the Christmas business in the US.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, notified UPS on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 assistants.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought in the parcel services harsh criticism.
First Fehnsturm, then striking Kaltfront
The next night, in the valleys of the alpine order side of the Föhn, the Föhn breaks through, as Meteosch had announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night of Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm thickness through the hairy valleys.
After the spring on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crossings us, bringing strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west current.
On the alpine side, at night until Wednesday, the hairdryer breaks through the valleys.
The Föhn blows until Thursday morning in the Föhntälern with Böen from 60 to 100 km/h, separate and especially in the Urnerland also with more than 100 km/h.
The Föhn can move to the neighbouring central country, and on the mountains even the Orkanböen are possible from over 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday, stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture on the alpine south slope begins to staunch.
This is where rain lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, in the next 48 hours south of the Alps, with some over 100 litres of rain per square meter, this has to be calculated after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn air goes out, in which result is a cold front with strong, partially heated rain from west to east, rolling over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormily, and the temperatures go back considerably.
The following days there will be autumn in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will become sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a so-called square in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologist of Reformation".
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the middle of Rome.
The name had been applied for by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, parish priest of the Evangelical-Lutherian community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority only in secret.
The place becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk who spent a few months in Rome around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time he felt the city as a lost scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then begun the splitting of the Western Church with his thesis against the abandonment trade.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but which is by no means equal to "luggous" images.
On the contrary, it can seem quite dark to the specific topics.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books.
Cyclicals are created that devote themselves to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments or patrimony.
With this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with his focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of ancient painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original Bibelcititat and each of them a sentence of the artist, who here forms his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old double allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"The education has already happened with the pipe rod," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I tried to work this out, perhaps to bear me again with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to make art more important again in a fast-moving way: "The perception of image worlds is now marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolicly, that's where it's being pushed down.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" into the pictures, let them look at them, discover and feel what power they have: "The image looks for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "he always" was a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his images".
Old people did not take full care of the Bible but chose the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Otmar-Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Start of construction closes for BMX-Bahn
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, ground hill modelled for a round course: One year later, almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX train was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration led to persuasion, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So the hill, looking for new space - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
The approval will be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosbach-Bock has now been able to report to the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "further commemoration" with the work of the former indoor pool.
DFB strengthens commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
Football is responding to the growing situation in Germany and assures politics of its help in dealing with the problems facing it.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say, in principle, that's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the chancellor office next Wednesday and I meet the Minister of State, Ms. Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"This will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would like to help.
However, the key course must be policy.
The German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Brown Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesligists also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "image" newspaper (the Tuesday) and described the project as "naturality".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We can help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "preminent sign of the league".
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM-qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint work of German football".
That all 36 license associations in their places had started their own projects is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have spent, will be lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and the next year, together with the DFB election and the Federal Government, the association provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already got the total sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive loses an eye in case of accident
The chief executive of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost the left eye through a fall in early July.
After midnight he fell on a water glass that he had carried in his left hand after the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, the "Wiekschaftswoche" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bled, he's not powerful, then he dragged himself out to the street - he told us so last week," says Hasso Plattner, "WiWo" SAP co-founder.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "full of work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue), he will return to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everybody can do such a thing."
"It's important to get up again when you fall down."
McLaren's replacement pilot Magnus out of fight...
Magnus's twittered a photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not available as a reserve driver for the two main pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, just like a week later at the Great Price of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 h/sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
In view of the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem position on the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the tortoise position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Chiefkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether weidenfellers will be used in all Europe-League games in the future, Tuckel was open.
With great probability he will also contest the second game.
The strong statement made by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, says Midfield player Julian Weigl for comprehensible: " Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robot cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany is to be a pioneer in technological change according to the German Government's will.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA Automesse about a "new mobility age".
The automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries who also come together at the IAA with representatives of the industry.
The Transport Ministry's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology.
In order to "no additional liability risks to the driver", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also wants to work towards a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car takes over increasingly, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected as far as 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to be around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still see skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dekra presented at the AA on Wednesday concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will continue over the next ten years, 32 percent expect that only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of those surveyed expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
After all, drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the Digital Association of Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could still be 15 per cent in running traffic, 45 per cent in the dam.
Well every fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances.
Boll says team start and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike only in individual at the competitions from 25 September to 4 October after the present stand.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys experienced it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time at a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Unless Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained single-European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the seats in Ekaterinburg, but also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"We should be guided by that," the world rankings five explained.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has taken a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteer was a schinbeinbruch.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figure-gruse cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: window dolls, which look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things - and with that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, in the meantime it is real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig to the Runstep), which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a happiness that the fashion creator has initially changed his attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made at the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly to be overlooked, who wrote fashion history without ever completing an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographized overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been done: In order to freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist has been engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been drawn to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special decoy: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, spectacularly fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He taught himself the design of fashion later.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later, of course, I bought them later.
For his first fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
It used to go into the long embroidery machines and make plans to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashion Summit Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener lace, fashion played a greater role, was then pushed off by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niches.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories like bags and regional costumes.
Above all, the so-called vintage fashion, which is related to past stylage, is a growing job potential.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitting and Embroidery Association together with nine other companies.
Only they may wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
There are almost no more private shops and even wholesale shops.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
Today, the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian space and are distributed almost exclusively via chains.
Furthermore, exports are weak, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains of the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Outpost of the Zwickau University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and laces.
In order to counter competition from Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think primarily economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter renewed the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before that, I couldn't start with traditional plauen lace."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitt - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plauen and surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener top.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney dares to have a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, this is not about a new film, but rather about a kind of continuation, which plays with the magic nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
If you play poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, it's still unclear.
But the director is already on record: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists on opening the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up more widely to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group commissioned to control reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), inclusion of private capital, and overcoming the population-meal system.
The statement establishes a negative list that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal state business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further private investment areas will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the Statement.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The law of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their activities and the use of professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also attended Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby giving consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant children and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt says that at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish have already been so heavily burdened with mercury today that on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would then be undisputed.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick", because smaller Friedfish, such as carps, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns against "ready to cause small amounts, especially in the event of unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage that the "health risks of the general population" cannot be expected in view of the maximum values in force.
Mercury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment.
According to a written information provided by the Federal Environment Ministry, German coal power plants have more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount of mercury emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanent and comprehensive", the "Mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were one of the most reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
