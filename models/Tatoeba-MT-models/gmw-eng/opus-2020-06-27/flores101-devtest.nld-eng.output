This not only proves the widespread theory that in any case certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was kastanje brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as hooking.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or to what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this sample is actually showing adult feathers and thus not the donation of a chick.

In the other race she took part in, the sitting Great Slalom, she became the tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers of the women's group before the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not succeed to sit during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered by the police from Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish women's rapists were arrested and found her cell phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them got hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the relief services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first recorded in Great Yarmouth, James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been sentenced to murder in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
She's in custody pending the charge and the trial, but the eyewitness report may be confused because her story has been published frequently.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos and photos of suspects.'
Crown Office has the overall leadership over persecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements are made, at least until charges have been filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something that the Palestinians wanted to do on the basis of the borders for the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, but the PA is only ready for a five-year presence.
Shooters in the additional test for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, because the test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In cooperation between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the sports shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters had an extensive safety and training instruction for the first shooting operation.
Yesterday, a nine-head election board (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP) was held.
In the last four years, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous National Election Council, which is part of a package of measures so that new elections will be held in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelli in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
Some 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods that become overheated. Overall, this resulted in six burns and four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) indicated that it was familiar with the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheated incidents that the company called 'not serious'.
"Very regrettable," said the Ministry's response to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was struck by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Marianaese calamities management office stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippines capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has hostaged tourists from Hong Kong by taking their bus.
With his M16 gun, Ralando Mendoza shot on the tourists.
Several hostages have been put in safety and yet at least six fatal victims have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned to exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was finally shot.
Lachgins went to work in medicine and followed the example of his father.
He was educated as an obstetrician in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When he worked at the hospital, Lignins spent his spare time investigating premature birth.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers have found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Competitives also brought homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two men. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels indicated that 'Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia became a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic after the government of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the participants in this survey supported this position, and they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and in the other end, 31% said that it should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three estafette competitions during the Gemeentebestspiele, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the drugs he needed to ease his pain because they're banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and informatics professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on 25 January the most famous prime number at the moment.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water coming on earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to be able to gain insight into the way planets originate. They especially want to know how the earth came into existence, given that it has been a long time since comets with the earth came into conflict.
Cuomo (53) was introduced earlier this year as governor and signed last month a law that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the packs "political nonsense and chatter."
It is speculated that in 2016 he wants to be a candidate for the presidency.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel each year for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no surface trains stop at Wembley; the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the grounds.
A possible lack of transport made it possible to increase the chances that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday discussed the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of an indigenous Darwinfink, the Midst Landfink, with an immigrated cactus soil fin, the Española ground fin, lasted longer.
Gold can be processed up to many shapes. It can be rolled up in small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be turned and plunged. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it has been made very thin, it can be put on another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'lighted manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You're already making an indicator using red carbon juice.
Then the color of the carbon juice changes on the basis of acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value shall be indicated on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feel strange and forms a kind of envelope.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a dishwasher connected to an advanced sewage system.
Recesses have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. Thus, in the era of the Romans, wcs were often part of a national bath house, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Once the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite has been fired into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's vapour circle distorts part of our light and image.
To create a satellite or telescope in space, you must have a huge rocket that is over 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are average - size cat-likes between the prey of average size food, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as runaway cats that are kept as domestic animals) who hunt small prey on larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, oats and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has, so that they will not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Forces consist of one to three adult males who are family to each other and who also have up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A troop of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that seem surprisingly much like lions (but not to other great cat-like ones) and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances and has five times as much pull power as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four catlike ones are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't grow out of full power like a lion. It's more like he's grabbing a whole sentence.
The favourite meal of ocelotts are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds like they can. The ocelot is almost exclusively hunted on animals that are much smaller than it is itself.
Founded suspects that ocelots use their smelling capacity to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling to the ground where they have been.
By night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very unobtrusively on. Ocelotts hunt prey by making one with the surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) escapes the large population from which they come (e.g. by moving across a mountain chain or river, or when they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often located in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other raw materials and other enemies are present, so the new population needs to develop or adapt to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhale people and they take carbon dioxide from those people.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants remove their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants, we eat mainly plants, and animals would not survive without plants.
The Mosaic was at the top of the food chain from that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosaics.
His long jaws had more than 70 abrasive, sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the shrouded, which means nothing or no one could escape from him.
It is not certain, but possibly his tongue was forked. It at turtles, large fish, other mosaics and perhaps even his own fellows.
In water parties there was also nothing safe from the attacks; also huge dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a party to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portions strange or unusual delicacies, including everswines, peacocks, snails, and some kind of rodent called a sleep mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women were sitting on chairs during the meal, but rich men liked to have a banquet where they lay on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain food that has come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no old Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the God's own house.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backroom accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called zigguerats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often out of place.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter on the street. Steen was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was enormously expensive.
According to Norwegians, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, Greenland found it on its way to the west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Maybe after the movie National Treasure, you think there's a treasure card on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original U.S. Declaration of Independence, i.e. 4 July 1776'. The text is at the bottom of the document.
Although nobody certainly knows who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches at 241⁄2 inches) has previously been rolled up for storage.
It seems, therefore, that the term has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French who joined the Germans in 1940 and thus fought with the enemy rather than against them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allied people with Operation Dragoon South France entered.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated South France within just two weeks, and then they went on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
The Latin Civilis, which means civilian, comes from the term civilization, related to Latin civis, which in turn stands for civilian, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a permanent cultural footprint and a balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence. Thus, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
In the revolution, thirteen states were a weak central government under the articles of the Confederation, consisting only of a convention.
It lacked the power to lift taxes, because there was no national executive or judicial authority and trusted all decisions to state authorities which often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between States.
First, all States had to agree unanimously with the articles before they could be adapted, but the States did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team together with the German team worldwide is the second most successful team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fights, rugby, cycling, hockey, scooter hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports is particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (with the largest island of Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands on which Japan has its own, Japan is often geographically referred to as a "slender island"
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when seamen from Europe pass along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base for exploitation, where the VOC started the indigenous cereal production processes and made Chinese workers work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was established in 1885 as the province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), in 1895 the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which the sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built in three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Rams.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better picture of how they once looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored.
For example, worldwide is the most common photo format for still images 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analog film era.
These are produced up to today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that took over the image sensor from the digital camera.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (share by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common classifications (e.g. APS-like classifications) are equal to or a dense approach to this image ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is a great deal of abuse and which is found ridiculous by many, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic and clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. So you divide the image vertically and horizontally into threes (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has been associated with European states, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervasive power had an influence on everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has this reason for money.
The church has been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years and this relationship of power and money has led many people to doubt whether this principle was respected.
Britain set up a maritime blockade against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved to be effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital services to military and civilians, but this blockade was the generally accepted international law laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that all parts of the ocean could no longer sail ships, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted sub-sea warfare of the country.
In the 20's most citizens and nations had a attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever taking place.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a bundle and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way to display different periods of time; each phase of China or any ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Between the various dynasties there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
At that time, fierce wars took place between various nobles fighting around the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the age of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from the absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, post-revolutional functions were to be obtained, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army, and the army ranges are no longer based on one's class but on the calibre of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class into a revolution in other countries.
Muhammad worked intensively on surface issues, often going for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mount of Noer.
The cave itself, which has endured the tooth of time, gives a very lively picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountaintops on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find, once inside the cave, total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful air and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave there is very little to see or hear of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is still in existence as the only one of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and belongs to the numerous large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Piramides of Giza" in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sfinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built as a tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a cousin or a square the bottom of which is missing.
Upstairs means that you have to start at the point and push the iron stick away. Below, you have to start with the archer (the place where your hand holds the iron stick) and put on the iron rod.
A upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces just a stronger and more aggressive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal characters, but do not forget that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
A group of market women sat behind Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They went back to the French capital in a carriage surrounded by jolting and threatening mutes that threatened the King couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages completely.
At one point someone in the crowd kept the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles up in front of the eyes of a death - banished queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism regarding the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Filipino government.
The American imperialism largely rested on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars one must know what was the context that prompted the rise of order.
The era in which this happened is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages, the high Middle Ages came, followed again by the late Middle Ages, which used to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offering or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a path that for the most part goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to road construction.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed so that car ownership costs can be reduced.
Mass car ownership also ensures a greater number of road accidents, leading to the development of new health care techniques in order to recover the human body.
Romance included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In romance, geography formed the individual, and over time, habits and cultures arose as a result of this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws imposed.
Constantinopel was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current capital of fashion.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 after Christ to about 1100 after Christ.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders came back with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time Paris also took over the fashion capital's title from Constantinople.
The Gothic fourth are high times in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a unique style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the crusades: people began to use buttons to confirm their clothes.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of living is a simple system that is usually biological, using stored seed from the eco-region, combined with varied crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimize the yield.
This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded persons who feel neglected are brought together by social standards, thereby enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or sex of their members.
Subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by means of a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, setbacks or willfully abuse during growing up.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical restriction of the child.
Unmarketable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before leaving or before leaving.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A popular child who has not been raised by humans may show behavior that looks like the behavior of the animal that the child has cared for (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning needs to simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding is a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clip man from Microsoft Office is also.
There is a virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons for children to end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, but yet this happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The aim is to ensure a safe home, loving care provider, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs neglected in previous homes must be met.
On the Internet, components of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions as regards the application of Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialisation' are proposed, for example, as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'sustainable relationships' when they examined public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings resulted in remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by looking at only micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's speech how it could be that people cannot understand that speech because of brain damage, can accurately estimate its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species of animals, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
The mutation adds new genetic variation; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system that resembles that of man can easily extract the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, it cannot have serious consequences: growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easiest to find vegetable sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (e.g. ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we must not be surprised if our ancestors solve their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means you wake up with a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back into sleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is pretty easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that will bring you back to your consciousness without you getting up all the time.
If you turn your clock off in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. In this way, you have to get out of your bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the bioritm are, for example, a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (and in particular water of tea, a known diuretic) and you have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm that a person has is facing the amount of stress someone carries in his or her body and mind.
Less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person is able to achieve satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can light up his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity are in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teaching of Buddhism. However, this form of Buddhism is extended with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from the Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and an imitation of universal love.
The energy of Kundalini yoga (light energy) is generated by yoga stops, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. Using the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a cooperation between the USSR and the US was established. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture ensure that the countries got into conflict with each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies faced each other, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces only kept it full until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganise along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were obsolete in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army invaded and formed Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, which was contrary to the Peace of Riga, the Soviet Non-attack Convention and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the mission of the Navy to ensure that a country retains the possibility of transporting persons and goods, while the enemy's possibility of transporting people and goods is hindered.
The United States is trying to get men and materials across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign by WOII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain was probably in German cases if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats have been domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years ago for the first time.
In ancient times cultures and ethnic tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get to her, meat, milk and skins.
The domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grassland. They were then guarded by goat keepers, just as the more well-known sheep shepherd often keeps a child or younger. Today is still protected in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse-rails consisted only of a track of planks, the horses had to walk faster and produce larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Cross beams were used quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first complete iron rails were built.
The first form of transport we know is running. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less often uplifted.
Two-legged specializations have been found in fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3,9 million years ago, and the Sahelanthropus, by the way, may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is something like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must determine the cause of the problems and remove them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have significantly changed the earth, and overcrowding and the extravagant human lifestyle have made problems worse.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent to the printery of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This design was signed by the President of Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on 8 July in the Garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap refugees are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today, and we call them birds.
Many people do not regard them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary figures forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be directly clear. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that no diagnosis can be made directly.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific EHBO instructions for that precise poison.
This insect group is called by entomologists formal "wants".
This term is derived from an age-old agreement with bedwives, which are insects that can very well parasites on man.
Both red predators and bedwits are nest bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the main neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spine and the eye nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice as much chance of getting MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These sets can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can raise the child.
Discover how the world works on the basis of the scientific method is the most important objective of science, which is the directive for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, question marks, and make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
The positions of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because of the decline in Greek knowledge.
In physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production through the biological clock.
Most beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-conserving oscillators that run a cycle for a given period of time, even if there are no external signals for this.
Hershey's and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses for implanting their own DNA in a bacteria.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment, the DNA was marked with a radioactive phosphorous in the phase and the protein of the case was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have many different effects depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned and whether the affected cells are germ track cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Because of other mutations cells can die or can develop cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who like to visit nature areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation can be seen, park and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people go from small villages by car to their workplace and pass by people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy no longer has the biosphere in the stable state, which has enabled human evolution to take place these past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or falling bridges are rare compared.
How come it is that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why is it wrong every day? His transport technicians are simply inadequate? Or is it something more fundamental?
In a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between the individuals are considered.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictable, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about in the mathematical field.
Connections have been made between the three key characteristics to better reflect traffic settlement: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and exploitation of road construction facilities.
Insects started flying as first animals. Thanks to their flight capabilities, they could more easily escape enemies and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
At present, only bivalves and meddling can't fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed exactly the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the Earth, and so the Sun was also (and other stars).
This sounds reasonable, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest river, and on a longest river, it transports more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
Of course 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stones went through pyramids until the end of the Old Empire, Giza's pyramids remain unsurpassed in terms of the size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
About 800 people live in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
The Italian language is for the official communications and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone living in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to dig them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This looked more like what we know of the four conditions of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theorized that they are going into new substances to form into what we see.
Legends are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. Of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atomics are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend for many people when it was launched.
The pen is as newer writing methods have arrived unfortunately reduced in status and is used much less.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a score sharpener.
You can ask yourself what's going to happen to the keyboard as soon as something new gets on the market.
The atom bomb works according to the principle that the energy costs to put a core together with many protons and neutrons.
As if you pushed a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split up again, a part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that they fall apart at least or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high plains.
There may be more seas on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could easily get to the surface there more easily.
Content theories aim to find out what moves people and what they address.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors they influence in order to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow's needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, there are two ways of dealing when managers are taking the lead on their former colleagues, and in one way they try to make themselves equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take implicit decisions and disciplinary measures, carry out evaluation discussions, delegate and address people to their responsibilities.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognisable individual. He or she gets the feeling of changing everything that the team has done so far and wants to make everything his own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards in excellence as normal teams, although there are minor differences.
In most cases virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to begin the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the objectives for the practice of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are highlighted when, within the functional departments of an organisation, all available resources are effectively used.
The result of this is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management needs to stimulate a culture in which innovate, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with a continuous model approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition. This reduces the field of research and allows more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumours can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
By increasing the number of new technologies, we come to know more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks for which intelligent behaviour is required is covered by research into AI.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer diagnosis and customer questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is used frequently in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
For every class many excursions are planned. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible.This enables students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, to see them in an aquarium or to see wonderful works of art.
Virtually an excursion sharing is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the capital of the state, which is re-designed each year and whose previous versions are kept online to serve as a stickbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but changes this quickly because they have a public.
Since students are often the most critical public, the blogger strives to improve the writing work and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and students to expand learning to well beyond traditional school day.
In good use, blogs 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussions on the Internet, students can take their own place in the context of other people's material while at the same time determining their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and even more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Farther north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are even almost uninhabited deserts.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, which was the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders south and west on the Atlantic Ocean and north on the Sahel region.
Women: Female travellers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not they are.
It also helps to make rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women must take into account that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, caught with the poor, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your male (cultural differences don't talk well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berberse fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tags, pots, learn products, water pipes and other conditions, but it is pure for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located near Rwanda, in the east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by spitting the Nyiragongo volcano lava and became the largest part of the city's streets, and in particular the city centre.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you have to check the state of play regarding the fighting that is taking place in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the most beneficial trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda boda (a motor taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuchto' is relatively poorly accessible and is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuchtoe is an outlawed city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and features an airport.
In 1990, because of desert storms, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage goods.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) can be found in the northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north along the border with Zimbabwe and south border is the Crocodil River.
19,500 square kilometers (19,500 km) is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where several species of wild animals are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and access costs apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar graph that is visible thanks to Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you leave the island and head towards the water side of Kowloon across the street.
The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong lives very close to each other on the land gained along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have established themselves, so if you're looking for proof of the colonial past of the area, then you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and extend from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengal interiors.
The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The area within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove grasses — they also have a few of the last powerful pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third cattle and swamp area is.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and in the area are now estimated to be 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
In the daytime buses leave the station on the border of the districts (on the other side of the river). Most of them leave between 6.30 and 7.30 hours, especially in the direction of the east and Jakarta/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the regional buses are often booked in full.
In most neighborhoods small Japanese Coaster buses drive which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow you to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that runs across the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanian city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3,50 meters.
Under the bridge is the crossing height 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most striking indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East-Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also lived on self-supply agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other native tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly also called 'the great province of India', arose in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
There was a three-century colonization period among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December the year's largest tournament takes place on the polofields in Las Cañitas.
At other times in the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for competitions.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley you can also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
In the remote islands you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Return your money before you leave the islands, because Falklandian currencies are very difficult to exchange.
Montevideo is below the equator, so if it's there in summer, winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures are higher than +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature is almost never below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains roughly the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'natte' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elanden, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, however tam they look.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you must be aware that scents and other wild animals attract bears, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrance food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in 1850 and is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain did not want to leave the port.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, came to a violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches in North Harbour district extend north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have Pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can just be safely consumed, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are journeys to the reef all year long and injuries due to these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube walls occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they occur outside this period.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of people and would just swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton and they normally do not live in the ocean.
Pre-reserving ensures peace of mind with the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives on his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually use a travel agency to book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation from and to the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also keep you reserved if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those present at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even if the music on the main piano has ended, there may be other parts of the festival site that turn into the late hours of music.
For families whose children are still young, there are special camping sites at some festivals.
Take care of where your cabin is when you pass the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a huge noise. If you are too close.
Cruises to Saint-Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers from the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos tend to get the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Frames and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes hard to find.
They usually have special offers in the area of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. If people are drunk, however, it affects their ability to judge and all the perplexed gamblers know that it is enormously important to stay sober.
If you go into high mountains or go over mountain passes, take into account that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little fraction and it rides differently from asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
It can also be hindered by falling or blowing snow or by the presence of condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The largest touristic African trekking band are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their journey.
The concept safari refers in popular use to country travel to view the beautiful African wild animals, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment allows a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetas and leopards, you need a binocular.
A walking safari (also called a forest walk or run-safari) means that you are walking in a row for several hours or days.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts are played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games took place twice, the first time in 1964.
If you've booked flights and accommodation announced before 2020, you can be in a penitent situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March most corona virus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between 2500 and 130,000. Normal tickets will cost around 7 000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have a iron and a ironing board available. You can borrow these items often, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't want to wear coated socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not become too hot (this may cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, incinerate).
You can clean water in different ways. Some ways are effective to reduce specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to cook water for a minute, in other areas water has to be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, you can drink the best water from a closed bottle of a reliable company.
Travellers can face animal plagues that are not present in their own country.
Unharmed can ruin food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or pass on infections.
Usually infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that are violently injuring or killing people, are not considered to be pests.
Tax-free shopping means you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duties.
Travelers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a lot of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through abandoned backward terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to driving on land roads? Then keep your head there. You come across many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The maximum speeds set are markedly lower than in previous and successive areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and it is even more important here to keep you on it than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more reach here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Slips support the feet of the rider and hang on both sides of the saddle down.
They provide the driver with more stability, but can also bring with them safety problems by being able to hold the feet of a driver in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but with the foot in the rope, they can be swept along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear first boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety bulges. As a result, a roper can release the saddle when this is pulled backward because a rider of the horse falls.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climate destination. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.

Skiing has existed for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating 5000 BC!
The beginning of ski sports dates back to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Ski backpacking: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skiing or skiing.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skis or mountain climbing, which is done much on steep terrain. Here you need many stugger skis and boots.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good circumstances, you can travel longer distances than running, but it is rare that you can get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on built-in slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries, and passengers between different countries usually have to apply for visas and have passport checks several times.
The Schengen area, however, operates almost as one country in this area.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to re-enter passport control.
When you have an Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which products are antiques produced. Some tax offices give goods over 100 years of age the definition antique.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to mark craft products as antiques, despite being newer than comparable mass products.
Among the Sámi, keeping reindeer is an important form of living. Also, the culture around trade is very important to many with other professions.

Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary according to geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Highlights and effects of heavy weather, for example, are heavy wind, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, water pants and hurricanes.

Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for 'cursus in hostile environments' on the Internet is likely to provide the address of a local company.
In a course, usually all the issues outlined here are dealt with more in detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and consists of role playing games, lots of EHBO and occasionally weapon training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness. However, there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned sexual surgery abroad should ensure that they have the right documentation for the return journey.
It varies considerably whether governments want to provide passports that are not mentioned in sex (X), or to wish to update a name or gender to documents.
There is just as much difference in the goodwill of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Moreover, research into safety controls has become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they do not come through this scan with uninvited privacy and dignity.
Mouse streams are the returning flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to underwater topology, the return current is located in a few deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can arise.
Most of the deaths fall due to fatigue, trying to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you've escaped from the strong current, you've been swimmed back.
Try to focus on a place where you're not caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you're noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the cultural shock (you have a less large 'marriage feeling'), it takes longer, and it may be more intense.
Travellers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty re-adjusting themselves to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture.
Earlier when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travellers who return home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound belongs to the most interesting activities nearby.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of sellers and tourists here is always audible. The story of light and sound resembles that of a book.
The Sfinx is the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the full streamed crater of an active volcano serving as spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass through the plateau, after which they come out again to form the 360 km-long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is with 4892 meters the highest mountain.
A satellite phone can be your only option at remote locations, where there is no reception for mobile phones.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with free view on the satellite to be able to carry out a telephone call.

It is usually necessary to pay for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination to sail. The 'Land of thousands of lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland so many people sail in their free time, that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in 40).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
For example, you can spend a few full days in the historical place and stay on the ship.

Curiosity companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things via air transport, it may take days on some routes before being unloaded and coming through customs.
Only as a check-in luggage could it be processed faster, and according to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and that is why you are.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is by counting a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, let your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the fist rule is that you pay about four times economic class for business, and about eleven times for the first class.
It usually does not make sense to search for discounts for business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Air carriers know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably and the airlines therefore charge matching costs.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is spoken mainly, but also the Russian language is a great deal of it.

On the other hand, men must wear pants to a minimum over the knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed every time after the end, so you may not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!

Premodern observatories are today out of date, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not yet a major problem today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, better accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and the concept came from there.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, where the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have taken over many traditions that belong to the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at a given time.
Of course, there are Christian theological statements for this tradition, but it can be just as good to be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
