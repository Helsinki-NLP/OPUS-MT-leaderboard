Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates deliver as well as real professionals during shooting with People's Photographer Tuan and despite the wind, ferment and rain.
The romantic shooting's in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on the fact that one comes into conversation with him once, that one also talks with him about why one or the other apparently felt it as it was written in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "phrasesmäher" of the "image magazine.
Despite the months-long debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked to have Mesut Özil continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed that it would be that way until some time," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist contradictions during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready to talk to Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build a pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club, you can talk about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far".
Linz: Garden cottage burned in Schrebergarten settlement
At 14.13 am, the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberg species settlement, there was danger in delay.
The professional fire brigade pushed out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically to the fullest extent of the fire and cleaned out to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden cottage, he had put a battery in to the store at noon.
That might be the fire cause.
At any rate, the charger was according to fire brigade in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - just like the fire cause.
However, he should be considerable because the owner had many collectors in his garden cottage.
Angry Mother Turns Back: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Road
What made Lindsay Lohan this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to tear the children away from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Laaded") streamed herself live, as she seems to want to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the stream.
Here you can see "Linsay Lohan kissing for luck"
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make up as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family fled just before the actress, Lohan followed the parents and their children.
She tells the adults to engage in child trafficking.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in that clip.
"All the world sees that right now", Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing out on an ear rate.
Under tears the actress mourns for how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
International Ticker: Number of Deaths to Sulawesi Increases to Over 400

The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet been brought to the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk returns as chief of the Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning was a Tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro car builder.
The U.S. government police sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to stay.
Party Day of the British Conservatives
Scharf guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party's day is due to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit-Hardliners, on the front of President Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name doubles for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population will vote - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Don't") - is meant to be Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populists Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the front of the polls.
Its sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still there," said development leader Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The incarcerated and leaved Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the Task Force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/gear combinations were expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important stage in the processing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "heavy organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities submit to the Audi Chief that after the exhaust gas frauds are notified they have authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values.
He knew or deliberately ignored the manipulations.
Currently Head of Sales Bram Schot heads the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumption testing standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, the "Heilbronn Voice" said.
In principle, he sees a sinking demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot's based on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm should go to the DFB Presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, in spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup-out and the Özil-Affair, wants to again run for the office as President of the DFB next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to watch if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "notable" if he did not "listen" to the future project after the release for the 2024 football team.
Since April 2016 Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who crashed over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM CEO Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed to consult the Bureau in this role in the future and then, of course, would be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as a DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gundogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player should become an integration ambassador without a migration background.
At present this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migration background works clearly into society and football and says, "the topic is important, as we have to take care of", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Take off properly with half-witnesses
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's rather for the brush.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles.

A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly provided for clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver live followers of the Gülen movement and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow the pathists of the PKK or guile movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
The Cologne city centre had been partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is criticised because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizens Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhröfe and Schrecksekunde
At a joint concert in the New York Central Park, musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have applied for more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Accommodate wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night before Sunday, about 60,0000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed up in the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrendous second when many viewers thought the sound of a falling metal barrier to shots, got scared, and tried to escape.
Soon panic arose, people ran together.
Seven viewers were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people off stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet every year.
Anyone who wanted to get used to had to read and spread texts, photos, and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause by the audience - buhröfe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, although expressed itself together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out as a judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Kavanaugh Board.
At least three women have raised abuse accusations to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations, after two women who, according to his own information, have experienced sexual attacks themselves, faced him on the way to committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come in an elevator with me at any time," Flake now said at the concert in New York to the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist
Government Speaker Steffen Seibert defended the ouster of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the media conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he prompted people to bring out the man.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This is true regardless of whether it is a legitimate cause or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying or of supporting or membership in banned parties or of the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failure of the coup on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused attention.
They came free and could return to Germany, but in Turkey they are still running processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-seeing his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: Yes, that's Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port bar "Schellfischposten".
With its guests, presenter Ina Müller takes a lot of beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis drink courage for mandatory singing.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Greatest Day".
The journey to the high north, however, was not good for the Municher.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely snouted on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed-selfie shows a completely lavish Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick. He only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings he has now gained: "Regel one: is NOT going to Inas night.
Rule two: never drinks the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina passes around half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is truly on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broths, fish broths or - probably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly uprising, so far it has not been known.
Since she has been moderating TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrate
The entry into the 36 km long track bike path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself hard to find and disguised.
Recipes against the grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scherben, cigarette chickens, trash and unrat, demolated muleimers and now disassembled sign signs - so since the long run of the entrance with a group of seats to the bike path on the haße hill in Treysa.
A more than unspoiled sight for the showpiece railway track in the Rotkäppchenland.
The topic deals with members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt as well as others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüsenhagen's cycling officer.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There has not been a solution.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüsenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject has also been included in the local advisory board.
Not only the trash drives cyclists and residents - the sitting group is a regular meeting point on weekends.
Not only is it common to speak loud, but also is destroyed in the lattices: tores torn out of the earth, toms demoleted, shielded, seat furniture lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleared up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest place on the cycle path is in Treysa meeting point for a rest.
"With regard to the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße-Hügel," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new bicycle site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that places the threshold much higher to get involved in common good.
However, this would require a police strip to pass in the near future.
In principle, Desertshagen wants a development of the haße-Hüße-Hüße.
He had to be more attractive.
In fact, it is possible to be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no trace on the haze hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road", she explains.
This would not be a problem for sporty drivers, but it would be a problem for older people and especially for children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye twinners in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family association with coffee and cakes from the honorary officers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Hemig, a long Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Riche Weßling and the Blacks.
This contest, according to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other districts yet.
What did the lyrics see connected to?
In the places the Hiltruper lake and the market alley were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Hemig chose the Allee in his swearing song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
Time and again it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short breaks of conversion with short interviews with the interpreters or clues about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke knew about sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the jury's favourites, there was still something special - so that others can hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Unzeit can play an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Heinig mit sein Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rodel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children came to the final - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury's originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value were left to the jury.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Association of Economics and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the Game Test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red film - can only decipher when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can read nothing for mistake.
On the cards, for example, is to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that it is now to be encrypted.
For here should be guessed not the terms, but the codes.
Different players per team are the cipher.
He's getting a code card on which maybe "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "würfel", "Fest" and "Windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; for this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The cipher thus lists and reads out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prag" because he watched in school and knew the window crash there.
This is how Runde continues for Runde, team for team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite - but you can better combine them with any hint that the encrypter gives there.
So maybe mysterious, but not too turned off, the rewriting should be, otherwise you make it unnecessary to his team.
The most cryptic of "decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info makes it easier.
But once you get rid of it, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling you have in this inconceivable game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre primes "codenames", which also makes an agent theme on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is only about guessing and not about winning points, it can easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's greeting police and harasss guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach at night from Saturday to Sunday double.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper Town of a passing police strip, later he also fell in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholized the issued card by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention centre.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of registration marks by non-constitutional organizations.
Works Pressig was home of the Schublocks
The train station in Pressig was the turntable in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffered in buffer, it was heard in all pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That doesn't raise anyone up.
The brakes also squeezed and cracked the wagons.
This was railway pure.
Statements that represent Dinkels' home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep-rampen mountain range to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 metres has its steep point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to deal with this, earlier tractors and drawers that had their home in Pressig were needed.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, apprentices' workshop, driver's and train masters.
"Heart piece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
From the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was established in 1968 Bamberg, Loks was also operated for the secondary railways Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehsten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalen.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawers.
In 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were added in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off, and in 1991 the rest of them were abandoned.
Heidrich: "It's regrettable that you didn't see any better use of the location, even in freight transport."
At Pfingsten in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Director celebrated a pumpy station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig railway station was history.
"The rangers and hemmshoes did the most difficult work on the train," Dinkel recalls.
Every mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places, and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infra-InfranungPlus article.
Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings three is Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian put on number 13.
The brother-in-law now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Art and pleasure" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great ease, the organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round ums Walberla" within the scope of the series "Art and pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor's address showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mitterehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already played an active part in the selection of artists in the past and in the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is again a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high recognition of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
During the walk through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
There are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits visitors on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened up, playfully furnished with 20 windwheels, 24 hooves and 24 alu tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun flashing through the bush in the background, the object seems fairytale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote himself to the event 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in the wind.
On half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy paintings made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic of "windgame performance" to be sunk through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singer celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtens, too, at that time made their disgust air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find partout with the fact that after the disintegration of the church choir "Cecilia" there should no longer be a sanges life in the district.
It has now become legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated large in the "house of meeting".
"It's going to be full today," Mr. Jürgen Holstefe thought, and he should be right.
150 guests had a real success for the Albachten singer.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The riser marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring can be found quite well in Liga three.
No trace of scaly or fracking sauces, the independents make their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker made an immediate contribution: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
On the contrary, we are not dissatisfied.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring that to the finish, such a game can already tip," white Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routineed forces and brought the full yield to its goal.
"We all know who is in such a derby on the other side.
This doesn't break our necks.
I saw quite good volleyball in the course of the day," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and went straight to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent, after just three days of playing, it seems impossible.
"For this it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga Volleyball, this is not nearly comparable. In the fourth league, they do not want to look down any more.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we'll be going to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Trauumschiff".
Now she talks openly about the series having a say in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Chefhostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Trauumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues took me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "trumship".
Now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it's possible that her husband could have been quite nigh at the time, but "how many men also made Hans talk about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right person and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've adjusted," as she continues.
She always had the feeling "not to be good enough for him.
He saw inside me an emancipated woman who I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
On the day before the civil wedding, I sat in the wardrobe crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced himself to love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not possible all day.
I have approached love far too naïve."
The night age, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our bird is not a moth, but it's a little bit of light.
And the glaring shine in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-soleutenplatz dipped it over a fee.
But it's stop Filmfestival, as more or less famous people want to sung in the spotlight light.
So on this late Thursday evening he torched over the square to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
The public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The needy institution in the parterre of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to bring about a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, there's a smell of heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the road: invited guests who have just had the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next to the opening film at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival each year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: From the whole Earthball the works shown are known.
What does not have to be included in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sleek advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The bird binds itself around the feelings of a good fairy, and two bully doorsteps actually wink in him.
Inside, the loaded ones press, they dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be presented by DJ rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinsing down with Cüpli exquisite chickens.
In the delicacies store in the Souterrain, oysters wait for slurring mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprung.
And the hammer is: all the outlets full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The bird studies the sign at the escalator: "Train a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two separate instructions were to be, he would be in the dress code.
But it's rather a constitutional construction, and it certainly already saved life.
In the homeware department on the upper floor, the poultry plows a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been buying for years for that brand, is not here that evening either.
But since a face is known to the observer, between local prominence, cash register table and kitchen articles, Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor may not be far away.
And really: just like that, Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with soon sixty almost as a chorknabe.
He's not being scrambled, he's not given up, he's at most stuttered.
Especially for this restraint, like to misunderstand as tightness, love international stars this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new homeland Mexico.
After a 2–0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video already published on Saturday.
Maradona dances in yellow-colored jersey, fired by the players in the 15-secy clip of a team member.

After the game Maradona called in a TV camera "Immer with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has trained the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send by Last-Minute-Pleite "on the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball bandist ASV, could hardly understand it: "Such a bitter defeat". His shooters were "destructiond on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly over wide phases, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we've totally slept", the ASV trainer got angry.
Quickly the masters of the house with 8:1, also the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a backpack went through the team," Bieletzki put together the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the residue was only two goals.
Especially Sendens Best, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst went on to 15:15, then the season changer ran almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take action against the impartiality.
Bieletzki tends to guard against looking for the blame with others.
But: The 120 seconds term, which Steffen Mühlhoff cashed, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood well behind seven men, and repeatedly threw them to the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to be done," said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV-Torre: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hanging (1).

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel until 2021 as chancellor
According to the quarries of the past weeks, the GroKo cashes out several polls.
The SPD falls back in a survey after the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday across Germany.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday election, the government parties would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid, of the SPD, CDU and CSU.
This means that the large coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question at all major research institutes, except Allebach.
The government parties come consistently to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: The AfD, in several surveys, is the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach parts of the votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the percentage of votes.
But also the restraint for chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel the right person in the chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey revealed on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes the large coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed a marked loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again run for the CDU chair in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for it, 44 percent against it.
As a result, 64 per cent of the Union's supporters do not want a candidate, 35 per cent.
Aushang bei Aldi: Price Reduced to Luck
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says there are no more romantic acquaintance stories in the times of Tinder - he should have a conversation with Aldi about meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is a place for the great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxer short snacks at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have taken the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the hot brie for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
The real Hollywood-Lovestory potential has it when love is preceded by an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-found plot.
If the type still reports to his worshiped guests under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consortium - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch is sure to wish that she will also find her dreamman, whom she has talked about briefly about the "30 percent reduced bio-pute meat".
She definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of being an analog.

Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's shape and fitness.

Football: District League: Researching the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrhein makes courage
There were moments in this young season, and Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Word karg, the coach of the VfL Wolbeck football district, retired (internal) only to think about the lack of performance on the green.
It's all the story.
In the meantime it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taure fresher evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, during the past season only sloping thin on the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up every single person for the game to simply say "Thanks" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game parts in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost would have been a matter of revenge, when in minute 41 the SCA in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer in front of the Wolbecker Kast - Tormann Damian Hallas proved himself to be master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters just failed.
Schroer also came late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, the left side of the fetch missed a fresh cell cord again.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 meters before the guest's housing there was an indirect release for the lords.
The fwelt itself stood up and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right flap hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, they should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck went to his hand in the 80th minute the leather in the penitentiary unhappily.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the victory hit on the coup in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 14 o'clock on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
When a helicopter landed, there were turbulences, as the police against oe24 confirmed.
The Heli was captured by a windböe, forces on the ground, and came to rise on the side.
Police, rescue and fire service were immediately agreed.
With a large ban, the forces came to the disaster scene.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Insomniad only slightly injured

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate board members
As a result, only 8% of the board members on the 1st of September were female, as the report says, "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and the German Press Agency was ahead of it.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said foundation manager Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the USA, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-based leadership teams - with few exceptions - are far from imaginable.
The residue makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented in comparison.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the small increase in women's share among German stock exchange companies was only due to positive impulses on the part of medium-sized enterprises (MDAX).
Although, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years foremans - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last time, 26 women worked in the board.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in their own interest in the coming year," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to take a self-commitment to increase the share of so far "zero percent".
A different picture can be seen from the supervisory councils: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"The same number of women recruited each year for the board of directors would have reached 40 percent in 2023," says the report.

With this question, "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have been involved.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only amounts to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley, even with each car, are very strong.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train at the opening of the 60th Abswinder Wine Festival
With a torch train, the tourism association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the club organizes the wine festivals, which continue to climb every Saturday in October on Rehweiler Straße.

You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzess Lisa II later came out symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Beautifully, that so many have found the way to us to Abtswind". Later, "The Troglauer" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had fixed the drink prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary of the afternoon.
A celebration evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house before going to the second round a day later in the banquet.
In Bonn: Notified car power in Taxi
An emergency medical car is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantant has been fatally injured during the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they're supposed to help - save people's lives best.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end to a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been killed during the collision of a emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that drove in green.
After the collision, the doctor smuggled against an ampel mast and a tree.
He recorded the passant who died at the accident site.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver badly injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from force of use.
The also seriously injured 29 years old emergency doctor could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called-for emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blamable out in the league, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is expected to give yet more talk.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the restored Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's passport, all Manchester's defense players remained standing, and Arnautovic was allowed to pass the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously inadequate performance over long distances.
It is very different at the moment that the mood is at United's Manchester City rival.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2–0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team first broke the outsider's defense bar.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, provided for the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No longer Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought in the Premier League with Liverpool, a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like at the Cupaus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his locker.
So, after the reds were started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London town clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (ex Watford) celebrated 2:0 victory.
The fans of the Gunners, where granite Xhaka played through, however, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately turned Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made a decision with his third season hit.
As a result of the fifth victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now right behind the big rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirato Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeatable at the 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row, and entered 8th place.
VW-Kernmark missing: Paris automotive salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the ringing of driving bans and retrofits are not expected to let go of German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week at the 2018 Motor Show, they show their new products in the French capital along with competition from all over the world.
The diesel actually doesn't play a big role anymore.
However, the potential exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A great name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models here, among other things: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
However, both were officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not supposed to start until 2021.
The new 3rd is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well one million visitors came.
The heavy earthquakes and the following tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens of people are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had strength 5,9, the second strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there was enormous damage to property.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach at a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still well up.
The figures are from Palu only until now.
However, many other communities - along Sulawesis West Coast - are also affected.
Some 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a helper team the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-careing interests of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of one month at the house Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything other than ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. on, the Bolidens were already in front of the church entrance portal.
First, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a fine curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were included.
The sermon held during the biker divine service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical undertone.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic and calm tones," says Fr. Frank Schröder.
Also this was certainly a novel yesterday in the history of the motorcycle divine service.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great celebration: The milk comes after the apple
And even on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided their hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Neemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Nemerg leave the children the field, and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force, a finely crushed mass became out of the apples.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Nemerg stacked a layer of apple pieces that look a little like chopsticks for layer over one another.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
However, the breeder farmer had already completed completed specialties.
Thus he opened his "Schatzkasse" and presented the latest spring whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing the apples, but also discover the built-in Hüpfburg for themselves.
The Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in temporary games at some stations as part of the festival.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also be offering an action day.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, not the home house in the heart of the Asparageldorf will be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the subject at hand: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season guide: "Bishisse Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, Trainer André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed pros from Hanover 96 around them and gave them courage.
However, there was a lot of positive at the 1:4 (0:2) of the table's last visit to Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "That's, of course, disappointing, because you're always taking a lot".
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, stand down with two counters all the way down and are a descent candidate in their current constitution.
On the other hand, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season of heim win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46,300 viewers in front of the DFB-Pokal winner, who, after the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome, moved to the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse during his debut debut and never to get hold of Hanover's defense.
The storm, which has long been hit after the World Cup, showed with its speed and enforcement ability why it is so valuable for agreement.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by FC Liverpool, stood for the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurters, which began to flourish.
A headball of Lucas Torró, forged on the gate net (17).
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, which replaced Kevin Wimmer (returns) in the short term.
The lead for the houselords fell almost compulsive and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball in the penitentiary after a defenseed corner, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesligatre for the resistance player AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who had been able to get through and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weysandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more boldly forward, burning ideas remained until shortly before the end of the year, when the connection hit the line.
The Hesse were much more efficient there.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only showcasing for the Frankfurters against overinvited guests, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Throwing away Despite cool temperatures, the Oktoberfest in the city center had a good mood.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter managed to do so in front of millions at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy Cross-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Crusade on September 14 or on Sunday thereafter.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is to have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then there was blood from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Geisinger parish, the divine service was badly visited.
After the divine service, the procession took place for the Holy Cross Church and with the final blessing the church ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided the visitors with savoury dishes as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will be taking until next year.
After the scaffolding has already had some time, the damage could be more precisely identified and the individual tendering procedures prepared more specifically.
It is certain that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more have been identified, which has only been possible through scaffolding.
The pedestals are finished, before winter is still to be started with natural stone works and one hopes to be able to complete half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities on the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to its destination - all present members agreed at the date of initiation.
Finally, the 12 wheelchairists who have been living in the home of the life aid Danube Iller for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader took into account in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago when the former US Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear the house off.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, the architect says.
Lebenhelp Donau-Iller opens new residence
About 4.6 million euros invested in the new construction.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained in the planned framework - time as well as financial.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom of being able to move even without outside help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants, the tools needed to be mobile".
The housing and functionality had been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real happiness, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for about 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three groups.
Stolz is life support manager Heinz on the eleven full-time staff, all employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Vice-Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in Western Germany, but would get 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after the German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this clean dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jaddhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
Pjöngjang has given Pjöngjang the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean pungan-year-old dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipients about a year old already on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the animals' habituality.
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural estate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean powerkeeper Kim Jong On mid-September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply jointly for the launch of the Olympic Games in 2032.
As part of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the ToViag Ri test plant for rocket drives.
Austrian Moving History in Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the centennial anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which most often answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
It is quite different for Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director of the Austrian State Archive, to present it in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for Government
Back to the technical work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellors and their ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not ultimately conjure up the "return to the trade" mantra-like.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it is all about it.
If the Federal Government is ready to devote itself to its mission - governing it - then you should not stop them now with any debate.
Whether Union and SPD can actually make things happen together after the provocations and blammages of the last few weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the government parties meet with the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflicts.
First of all, however, conflict-based issues are on the agenda again with the Diesel retrofitting and expert immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to give the car companies a glimpse of their return premiums, and SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While there has been an approximation over the weekend in the diesel crisis, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a long-term perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spure change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will again be a conflict among the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not the same and the same has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society which is so diverse and sometimes contradictory in its interests is not progressing.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or being non-being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to fight - but always have an eye on people's life-reality.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both diesel and trace changes can be done in a pragmatic way - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checked working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had worked their legislates on the social security reform, a superlative social minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago.
At List Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger's statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of current service rights before running cameras."
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to "nominate from every suspicion".
Police pick up a street looking for women's leaks
Marxgreen - Lange didn't want to tell the police.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It had been predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide in multiple use, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road.
For more than a year, prosecutors and criminal police court have been handling the missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was locked up at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that there could have been a shadow of Heike's body in the course of the new construction of the State Road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia was held for the first time.
But before that, there's Krawallen.
The separatists did not forget to use the police in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there was conflict between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the supporters of independence with colour powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guards.
Some 3000 police officers, Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil, wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, who last year were in use as illegal referendums in the elections.
When trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would have tried violently to break through the police chain, and the officials, among other things, tried to paint bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested for being slightly injured by 24 others, and were called upon by the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the referendum on independence is part of the year.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
Carles Puigdemont, then regional president, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections had been held in the region.
After the appointment of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was completed.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra is based on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Intelligence: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white Ailen continues to be on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only 0:0-distinct.
The final light and the third last they set up in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a congregated intrusion.
The first half was not too manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a britwurst could do so unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) tortoise of the entire party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only true - could the Ahleners have had when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action existed in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters was just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a balling of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The fast-pronounced counter via Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a low shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball of ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimtrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka to Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney to Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but also that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we have played zero," but unfortunately the zero has also stood forward.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were still against wood-winding and even though our opponent didn't want to play with us," said RW Ahlen's interimstrainer.
On the other hand, "everything was a bit sprung up" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't have the feeling that we could get a counterpart," says Daut.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too needy for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thank You Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition for which these donations are intended.
The honoraries assure: "These donations are also left in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little blank, but that should change over the day.
Because: "It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent price humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which should actually be weighed against food, short term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jump in.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "replace" did not allow itself to entertain musically the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so good that at the end of the hour some folk songs were sung.
"Simple great," Marcel Kreimer said.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"There should not be anything like a table at all," he still thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the further celebrations held in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coating - here's something going on.
Then, with the help of the fire brigade, Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück were taken away and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his desk saw.
Furnace works, beer lid with field motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A speciality offered three field beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Weedeshoven and Helen Roth-Büchschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The gathering is that the visitors then stayed for a long time until the evening hours, even without stage program that there is no at the Autumn Festival.
Scattering with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly applied for the construction of a skate facility in a very helpful way.
In several places there are appropriate lubrications, says Jürgen Kohn from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police filed criminal charges for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spoken on signs, including at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional election fair on 19 September a corresponding writing had been discovered on the sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at that time had apparently been left "only" with an educator, it could easily have been removed.
"But only a few days later it was there again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising plate must be replaced.
A special note is given just this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the table.
If the skate plant is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There have already been commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the school, sport and culture district, without mentioning name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the lubricated table.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plant.
After the old hospital had been dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally spoke out for the fire brigade.
However, this insinuation was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee were now voting unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohn says on the state of play that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word the city council has.
He assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Engpassing in air traffic control gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic shock in summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, the German press agency in front of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lotts lasts four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for trained lotts was emptied across Europe.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that several air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compressions and overtime, it won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in German air traffic control.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen-Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resultant costs and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas called on Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply in Brussels for regulations which "do not "sniff air" air security.
At present, the EU provisions would be voted by 2024 and there would be fear of further deterioration.
The EU was constantly exposed to lobby printing by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs of airlines would lead to a rethinking.
The GdF will only participate in improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offered a "agreemental training and future pact", said Maas.
The uptake of 120 lotsen students per year over the next five years has just been sufficient to compensate the age-related exits.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's plans for the conversion of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split up into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staffing beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 independent supporters demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large ban to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to the force of the forces, independence supporters have repeatedly tried to break the safety barrier.
They'd have attacked the officials with color and gunshots.
According to Randeleien, there were also indications between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported there were six arrests.
Better salaries and recognition of colleagues
The police had wanted to honor the colleagues with their demonstration, who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish Central Government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish Police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provocate and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands who wanted to give his name only with Daniel rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security gap in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown ones after the Panne became known a day before Tory Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a major traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The forces are on site.

Football: Juve trainer praises by top: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star striker played "this evening the best game along with half an hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought-in star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is good," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early residue through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst persecutor for the first time.
The Torjäger, who had been brought up by Real Madrid, initially put on the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner per headball, also carried out the preparatory work for the hit by head of defense Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to move in front of the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record tour shooter.
"We need to get even better off serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve Torschüste is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' overpower seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six counters for Naples.
The second table, trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not presented against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red of the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was allowed to feel that way.
The German national player went through Juve.
The team was a professional from Liverpool, where all seven league parties were involved.
The midfield player also played in the Champions League Party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "a half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the square at the 2–0 victory of the Turinians and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly curious appearance, Rapper Kanye West paid attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided foreheads and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
The musician will be allowed to call him "Ye".
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he wrote to the late singer Prince in response to his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not new.
The tenth album already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and there it means "you", the rapper says.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no heel out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was just more gripper, we've put him as good as never before. Accordingly, the list of Hutmar shots is thin.
Grade twice two torchances in 90 minutes, so that only rarely games can be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
In the first passage, the SG had only two possibilities, but the first one used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to an early tour (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work of Krause he was free standing.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the successor Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trader - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gateline and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide hit the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had been severely criticised before, that was different from that in the last few weeks," said the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Send Horst: J. Schumacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Kraus (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Body), Turl.
Gate: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to keep from it," he said.
"We didn't have access to them at all," he said, probably, the wing vocals with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that were caught with collective offensive desire.
He could still laugh, "A dirty victory," he still said, twinkled, and pulled off his players, on the other hand, the relief was to notice that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noticed, after a duel of two teams, one of them, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the classroom.
GWA-trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandable mixed feelings.
"That was our best seasonal performance by far," he says.
"How we come back after 0:2, how we hold against one of the top men of the league over the entire season, that was already phenomenal".
It is all the more bitter that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season score (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he laid pattern for Fabian Fröhning on the left side (39.).
We knew it, but you can't take that kind of player out completely.
"That was crazy what he had done," Lewandowski no doubt recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the turn of the sides, his own Elf made the compensation: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the turn of the sides it was McGill again, who made the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-charged game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann left (69.).
Despite overnumbering, Albersloh was no longer able to reinterpret the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against scrappers, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Gate: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Dual between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of Trainer Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football-Twingist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the Sachsen body.
A confirmation of the association initially did not exist.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few public guests whose departure in Germany ensures as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish president in Berlin and Cologne, and many meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
As a result, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in Tutzing personally.
The term was too short for Christian Wulff: he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy as President of the Federal Republic.
But before and then Wulff was a guest there.
So Academy Director Udo Hahn took him in when he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were with us already." That the Academy at the Tutzing Castle is always showing up prominently, but it was also a topic when presenting the annual program.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid 2019 have taken place.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "rist and deadly route across the Mediterranean Sea".
"And at a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Armaments, destruction, torture, death - war mocks any human idea".
From structural racism in society to the divisions between the poor and the rich to radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Akademie-Director Hahn said: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a 200-day session.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits a more visitor from the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left-wing to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Hall of Christ's Church in Wolbeck was "appropriate for adults as well as for men".
As a cabaret tester, Teubners got ready for gender understanding, not only with humor and heart heat for the (feeled) woman and the (felt) man and what else may exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben sat Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, this is the male sparring partner who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, just as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he doesn't open the door.
On the other hand, a closed door without a partner will not benefit.
The piano solo is now demonstrating the same thing: What would have happened from composing Mozart's, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door without hope?
So Süverkrüp slides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take any extra thanks.
She had the idea to enjoy the duo in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also a in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly corrected the victim numbers downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15 passengers.
All were now released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in the hospital for one night.
He will be released during the day, said a spokesman for the police.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was powerless frontally against a control board.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Wattenscheid almost the white West
The Ahleners had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"I was really happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he got more upset about the many out of print.
The concentration in the finals left his team missing this time.
Therefore the ASG ran almost to the end of a residue, lay at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
Only towards the end did the wider bank make itself decisive to the host women.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on left-hand sides, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkotter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league West.
At the second league finisher VC Allbau Essen the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out this," said Trainer Dominik Münch, looking forward to having an almost pointless performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost as much as they liked.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Essen has taken over in the two barn, but has not come into play.
We've done her well.
Our opponent has been at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "It has changed the adoption to three bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has been sucking in, and we've had a little bit of fun," says Münch.
At 18:17, the volleyball girls from the Ruhr area had the nose front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern resisted four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt, however, was made.
"The game was now a class better", the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge, with their charges, contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-whites brought through four, with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne has left a sheriff pile that can only be met with effort," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance of a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Statt side by side with top German politicians to underline the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The broad exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Home Verein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally back.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, Nottuln is already organizing his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day exactly then it's a year ago that we've done a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folktreff would be so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next folktreff is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folksongs, Evergreens and old beats," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln again and again.
For the first folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdette inspired the listeners with his international version of the song "Frösche at night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a social and humorous evening", says the invitation of the home club.
Those who play an instrument and desire to participate actively are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there at least enough.
Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but registration is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are on their way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
With this, approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - are still available for the billion-severe merger in the USA.
Last but not least, the opportunities for an insider's consent had improved, because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order to succeed in the merger.
From pure orchard to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflegung was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last start-up impulse was set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
He was known as "Kulmbach City and Land" when he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it actually was about fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture, no one thought at that time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpflege Günter Dippold in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should be lined by long roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticulture associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7000 members.
But by far the spectrum is not exhausted.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play a role as well as the use of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticulture association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the district president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. you can get a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the county association decides", added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of horticulture associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticulture associations in the district, there was no doubt that there was no doubt about it even circuit managers and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was done.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"The nature has consisted, it was already before us and we have to be guided by it," the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
For this reason, there is the incentive for the horticulture associations not to let go so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
It is also part of welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Landesverband, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful Feast, which was solemnly framed by the Thurnau Music Club's towerers.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN Red
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister is now giving absolute priority to the Trade Agreement - and shifting its speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressure of time in the ringing around a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has shifted her speech to the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the Minister will speak before the United Nations Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had explained that the negotiators of Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement between its country and the USA.
The United States and Mexico had agreed to a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been in progress for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are to be concluded, Trump's government intends to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would try a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous roads in Hanover.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
In the event of a trade fair attack, Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro left the hospital.
The ex-military ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo", where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
At the beginning of September, the politician had been attacked on the open road during a campaign event in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had especially called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks too, the associations made racist and women's dissuasive statements mobile against Bolsonaro's.
In São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for corruption and therefore must not run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As an ex-bürger champion of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in political operations for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round, there is a election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this - no matter who he goes against.
Bolsonaro is known for hyssating against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailment.
Another time he said the followers of Lula's left workers' party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, informed his producer Jörn Jößen on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children at the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen became acquainted with the band Gasolin, which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in a statement on Sunday as "roadboys", which "was everything but in all hearts".
The chief of government also reminded us that the monarchy-gender Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: Volume on press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Lord We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" add such a rewriting of rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the citizens' center shoe factory: Hardrock pure from three friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
Not a trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are excited about 120 visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is able to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own spring and the CD that will appear soon.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the concerted and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "to be admitted" staff are not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Lord We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not exactly hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used with "Lord We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing to ballads-like "Take Me Home" impresses by changing melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishäschen has, however, been a special recognition since its founding in 2005.
Full agility on Saturday, the band presents their hard rock.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and incorruptible.
In combination with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
In addition to feeling even higher-controlled sound than before, Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann provides an unscrupulous solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume of sound is of course part of the matter with such a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixed-pult team, lies at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is about press air hammer level, but it is still well below the controls of the "Wacking Festival", which point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, ear-draining 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume, as usual at the annual metal station in the north of the Republic, does not require the Ahenian audience at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can end up saying.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at the airport of Mülheim/Essen.
A sailing plane is crashed in a parking space at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the airport Mülheim/Essen.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailing plane had crashed at the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot died.
As the WAZ continues to report, the flight student has been on board alone - the plane is supposed to be a resident.
The aircraft had already found itself in landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just near a square on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an October festival takes place.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located at the border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the access to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump warms Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea, Kim, despite nuclear crisis, is quite well-soned is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president has become a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean powerkeeper Kim Jong Un.
Before followers in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for half such old spross of the Pjöngjang ruler's dynasty, although in the ring around North Korea, he proved to be quite tough chunks.
"I was pretty hard, he too, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to the stopover of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics still see little more than lip knowledge.
That the affection for the notorious "Rock Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be every memoryist, seemed to be well aware of the U.S. president.
In any event, he took the anticipated criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidial.
But he did not care very much about this, said Trump, and then pointed his toy finger to the crowd: "I always told you that it's so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this stuff-filled arena, but we only had 200 people standing outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visits, atmospheric and above all spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city centre was exhausted on Sunday.

Refugees Saved Thanks to Video Saved From Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have pointed to their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under the risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Unless we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in the attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he brought himself into danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his rivals had almost been beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the detention conditions would have been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and poles."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 Nigerian migrants had been sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now saved is not exceptional in view of the bad conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone call yet.
International organisations have long criticized the states in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the primary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised an intruder.
At 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then across the roof terrace and from there via a step into the ground floor or the front.
The teacher told the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen can not yet be said.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Mittelfranken, after he held the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the report, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a drive with his camping car across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man's remains remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has recommended legal status in Turkey in consultation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations of the two countries were currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is especially about arrest waves, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise themselves in the future, economic relations should be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had soon been transferred to a building of flight preparedness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally it had to take place at the castle of Wahn - but that had rejected the castle owners for political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes in the negotiations on the denucleization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a Washington encounter.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking the negotiations for an nuclear weapons-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest standstill is therefore that the US is building on forced measures that are deadly for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Unless any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," said North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could force "the knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri emerged.
However, there had been no "appropriate reactions" from the U.S. side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had only adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days urged the United Nations to comply strictly with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June Trump first hit North Korea's powerkeeper Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pjöngjang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: new cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a big buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thank God service.
The young people of HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone got on.
The result could be seen that the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's better not to cook either," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido's pump was served or the guests were allowed to serve on Quiche, Leberkäse or Cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while sorcerer Stephan Lammen provided amazement with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the head of state NRW of the Table
From frustration about criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationally because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice-president of the NRW Tafeln in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I fell too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, the head of the National Association of Tables NRW, explained to the dpa an understanding of the decision of his long-standing alternate.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table was doing that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticised criticism of colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starved."
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that have criticized me so much at the time.

The Lucien Favre team had negotiated against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half was still in the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Brun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) with a doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was changed by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86.94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
For the first time, the VfB Stuttgart also won.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against what was decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goliath Ron-Robert Targeters fabricated a curious cast owner that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB for the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete success, but also no mistaken debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a tour twice, played 2:2 and have been waiting since 2003 for an outward victory in the VW city.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 compensation with his second Bundesligator.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether their country's name should be changed in northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades-old conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be solved.
Athens had passed on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreiss, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs raised a stir with a rage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "enhanced" the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same sex couples have been able to marry exactly as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
Garden Day: 400 meters of hedge cut
There was a whole lot of work in front of the members of the Civil Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfrundnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the civil society association.
And it's been collecting a lot of things.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily, it's just a piece of form.
Because already in the spring the hedge was shaved.
The following breakfast for the work also has a long tradition.
"They should all remain in power," said Walter Schröer.

The police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break into the fall.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remains at the one-family house on the Königswieser Strasse when it is tried.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8:00 a.m.
The invaders realized that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system surprised her, however, apparently so that she escaped without prey.

Pleite bei Hertha: Picked up by reality: Bavaria v. Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants to "not let" the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance duel under the new Coach Niko Kovac should in no way increase for the Munichers to a greater autumnal depth.
"One week ago, you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a little reality," stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying us and that's why we're going to give us gas.
For the first time for more than a year out, no own goal has been shot, as at the same time in the previous season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football league lost first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its run-intensive man-competent tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks across the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overwhelming Bavaria can be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he walked with his losers in his birth city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim conclusion of his term of office stand positive before the break of the country - otherwise the tone is likely to increase.
For example, before the second royal class appearance of this season, Kovac did not undertake any exceptional measures at Benfica Lisbon after 2–0.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax begins as planned, which also forced AEK Athens to start with 3:0.
"Now we've caught up in two games, but we're going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text.
The defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the variety of opportunities and make mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old emphasized just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria was already standing behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took over again with one point of advantage.
And so Kimmich was at least positive with an eye-winner that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in shot line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan is presenting an exclusion from Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gundogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the clarity in the permanent debate theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB CEO defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was attacked by Özil, personally announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainz ZDF-"Sportstudio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future – because we also have many migrants in the U-Municipals – that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gundogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They had them out of this society because they had them photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest it that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "treated by the DFB in a reasonable way" after the World Cup affair, which, through photographs of the two took their start with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm a German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I'm not.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team of Özil.
In addition to Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integrator is now to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If one without a migration background works clearly into society and football and says, "The topic is important, we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup Off and the Özil Affair, he intends to run again for the office as President of the DFB next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make her as good as I am," Grindel said.
Yearer builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Roedental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady at the red traffic lights in the area of Lauter Höhe.
This told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange because the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a car driver who would have come off the road and run against a pilot.
The man didn't want any police on the spot and then drove off.
After that, the Roedentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been living in his place of residence in which he has lived for decades and rammed a building vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a warm impression and could no longer imagine much.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces are still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a German defence ground in Emsland, 980 forces are still involved in the extinguishing work.
That was what the Bundeswehr announced on Sunday.
As the situation of a spokesman continues to develop steadily, 70 honorary helpers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces was planned.
On the night of Sunday a surface fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which had been proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21, because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday it was called a breach of fire to adjacent communities no longer threatened.
In time, more than 1500 forces tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test ground at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also information flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to Bundeswehr, information flights with "Tornados" are planned for October 2 and 5 again.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrands had been moved at times up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after marriage came into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreiss, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs raised a stir with a rage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "enhanced" the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same sex couples have been able to marry exactly as heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
A new name for this small Balkan country has been set up in Macedonia by the eagerly expected referendum.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and the NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote with Yes, they will also give the start for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have become 90 years old on September 30th.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed with express consent, says Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, Swiss transplant emphasizes.
One assumes that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of the cases, a card is found at the crucial moment in the case of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, families do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very stressful," he says.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health card, as said by the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or counter organ donation - is not available," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has expressed his support for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses to do so.
14-year-old student is world champion in the head calculator
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the headlines.
He went on to compete in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The latest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The Computer Science Professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,430 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants came up with pocket calculators against guests from the audience.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while receiving.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago as 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superhirn, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
"Cutting heads can be trained," he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even billing competitions in stadiums.
The disciplines include square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because in early childhood headsets are already being taught more intensively and with other effective methods.
Urgent appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows itself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make her strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up their innermost places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena’s lung had been discovered.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbols law" in review.
This is intended to significantly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the prohibition.
Polar cold air brings to the west Neuschnee on the mountains
Next week, Ms. Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters in strong intensity.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern you can count above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelschicht, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers may start the annual knee care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may begin their annual knee care on Monday.
The unique "green spheres" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest poor federal state for about 200 years.
The up to five-metre-wide tree and shrubs are "return-set" and the last retreats for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as said by the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
On the basis of a command by the Danish king Christian VI, the Knicks were built in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their professional houses.
From that time also his name comes "Knick": The dense, intertwined demarcations could develop through "turning" the branches.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, about 45 000 kilometres of hedges are covered and give the picture of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by about 7000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only fulfill the Knick if it is cared for accordingly in winter.
Otherwise he takes care of a light line of trees, which in addition to the variety of species also includes the wind protection effect, says Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knee care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about on-site SItuation
The local Radika Pinto in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta right now on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has once again opened the airport so that aid supplies can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally arranged something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where do the people living on Sulawesi stop now?
Many have ran on surrounding hills where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and petrol.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government helps out.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners ran around partially freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information work on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don’t know if they live and where they’re staying because people weren’t at home during the earthquakes, but were on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many "Okay, no tsunami" thought - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami met the region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific fire ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the whole infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.

Kavanaugh Board: FBI study in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With an FBI study in Turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are seeking to secure the thin majority for the Kavanaugh judge board that is controversial due to demands.
President Donald Trump has set a time limit for the investigators to Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that have taken place for more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama around the appeal of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer cast angry tyrates against the opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had referred to the heavy reserves on Thursday as "the case", initially included further attacks against women and spoke on the contrary of "good luck".
In this way, he said, last doubt could be eliminated.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats with a campaign because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump arranges FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
They're going to investigate the well-known accusations of two women, that's all, a government representative told the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar equipment installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fix installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season against Mainz.
The relief to Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penitentiary," said Schalke 04 - and breathed on.
After all, the royal blues were still able to bring the short 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first season victory under roof and subject.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the tour by Alessandro Schöpf 11. of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from pressing"., with increasing length of play obviously more and more the head played a role.
No headball monster at all
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heildel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept on withdrawing.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," Schöpf said, who had no insignificant share of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manslayer."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," Schalkes Chefcoach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
The probably biggest manko in the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only bowler.
Fischbachau: Smoking column in the leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a walker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 13.30 am observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause of police and fire brigade soon found out: An unknown man had lit up on a two-square-meter surface at the Gschwenner Berg Müll.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discussed integration: A discussion at eye level
The author is standing in front of them, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Culture Policy" during the alignment of the evening.
El-Mafaalani is much more relaxed in reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligiblely.
With a lot of skepticism, hand-strengthening numbers and the one or other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to vote for it.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether political or left-wing is organized, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first, behave rather, then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there's a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee from his perspective tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
Sociology professor does not force his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject because "first, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, discussed intensively.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first properties in the new district of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This tells Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers on more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model.
Good 100 applications were received, says Frick.
"At present, the documents are being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor, it was the goal to have prepared the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the councillor.
After that, the contract could be awarded.
A total of 50 plots are created on the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses and four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight housing units each.
The development is now as well completed as the roads and roads should soon be paved.
A single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 income-oriented flats funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated to be built on the area of the new Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new building of a day care center.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose area.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo also succeeds in "great sport" on the bank
For the third time behind each other, Naldo does not thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the exchange bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Beginlf, but on the Schalker Schülf, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-metre-large Brazilian had talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1–0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked chief trainer Domenico Tedesco at all of his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call naldo, joined and said, "We thank him, trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-capitans, who, despite his re-reservist existence, did not close any grudges.
True, Naldo, who has been celebrated as the best Schalker in the past season, knows that he has not actually been put on the road with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called tax taxation.
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he didn't get into the boot.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important for everyone to be able to jump through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last time Naldo caught.
And the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself also on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry continued rapidly in August compared with the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was on a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Austria still has the third strongest mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands across Europe, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, so the index is still the 13th month in a row under the mark of 50 counters that indicates growth.
The only Irish industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer sank, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley trip could mean that the worst is survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains number one in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro zone have not fallen as strongly as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more than initially in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points a month ago to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchase manager index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices are being raised.
