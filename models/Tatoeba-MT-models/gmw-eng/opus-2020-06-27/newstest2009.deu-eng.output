The Prague Stock Exchange is falling into the minus business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange could correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the break-in of Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the break-in was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the response of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday's stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices could offset some of the losses over the day.
In the course of the business day, the Hang Seng stock market index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points, but was able to settle some of the losses later, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, who observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock market, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange dropped by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (up to 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush felt that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index sank by almost seven percent, with a similar break-in last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any evidence that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes concession: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
For Congress members still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said of the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different data may be agreed on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "encouragement" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views about what a package should look like to stabilise the market," said the democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg agency.
According to their words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American finance minister Henry Paulson on the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
It provides for a sale of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial corporations that are falling into heavy losses and endangering the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue your health plan, but I think we're on target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in the congress before Sunday.
This means that investors want to calm down in front of business in the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
Until now, however, it is still not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, whether the negotiations in the last minute could still fail in a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will experience some changes.
The total amount of aid to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in negotiations positively
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can agree its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains that it is based on obtaining finances for the sale of poor mortgage securities, which have fallen in value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate on Monday," says the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also satisfied with the progress made.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimated the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairperson of the SEN Christopher Dodd's Banking Committee, the managing negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden umbrellas for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to be responsible for the supervision of the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates of mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to Patria Finance David Marek's main economist, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And because you do not know by what mechanism and by what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether or not the plan will be adopted at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"It is much more important that Congress members agree to support the plan and that they will adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is the most important at this moment," said Marek.
Duell on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
So, of course, it looks like it's better just to buy yourself a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should play an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the nature of the use and the requirements of the future owners.
Certainly you're hard to buy at home a great expensive record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream at least of such a one.
So it is with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably be able to get headphones for twenty crowns off the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, the phone and the sims, it can play music and videos, both record it, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequently you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy lovers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music longer than ten-twelfth hours, mostly it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect cheap mobile phones to be unable to play more than a few hours of music.
If you make a phone call every now and then, you'd better be sure to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you won't have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours continuous operation with once charged out.
Another problem exists when you want to replay the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB lock, nor can every mobile phone connect directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a memory medium, but only a few card readers are finished with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
In the case of players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device through USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices form only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should examine yourself especially after the life span of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of the sound and of course also the ease of use.
If for you music is mainly backdrops and if you listen to them every day just for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can really do.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and also most devices can play music in the WMA format.
AAC is less common (a format using Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the respective pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be, and for itself, a striking argument for why a music handy should be involved.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and usually only limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is thought that this type of sales of music (including GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
The cell phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it is important whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless free-phone device.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker with which almost every mobile phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the music handys will be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs are usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really operate anyone.
A minimum of functions which are similar when operating with the earlier normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of any collision in the form of an erroneous mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transfers.
Which device to use now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding ticket, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
For basic models, generally only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort is thus the result of one single MP3 player.
The most common feature here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ telecommunications authority, which drew attention to the fact that the price of an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
According to the final steps taken by the European Commission in the area of roaming fees, it is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers from the Czech mobile providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How come the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to beg on the fact that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past had often said that there was no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with their own network will no longer have a lot of opportunities (at best he would probably find few more frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry into the mobile market of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction, to which classic mobile providers also had to respond.
There were similar votes on the UK market prior to the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for long.
In February of this, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers, thus raising to the country's five largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind the mobility.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to focus on a non-clinical target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Echte Kerle select Mobility - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could take its foot in the Czech Republic, as in Poland.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic chanceslos, the mobile operators think
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobilizing.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
There will be a market entry of mobility in other countries of our region," says a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly attached to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can not create a potential competitor.
For some time now, their interest in a start of a virtual mobile provider has been showing the group GTS Novera, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in providing our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile communications providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve progress in negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities vis-à-vis other markets.
So far, no subject has yet addressed us with a complex and serious project in this field," says his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srše from Telefónica O2.
Other providers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová, in rare agreement with the O2 statement, adds: "We have not yet found a viable and both beneficial project to which one could build on."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly show up a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment we must already have a concrete offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the best from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to look for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thereby also to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the providers can pull on a strand when it comes to something, also proves the long way around the origin of U:fon.
The probably strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the moment when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now just U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently further strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high requirements on the market itself and above all on its services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this related to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," said Kristián Chalupa, in his reply to our request from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a wording would not surprise representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, by ensuring that nobody abuses his position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Where virtual providers work normally abroad, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, probably the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a reduction in prices do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking to see that the three mobile providers are almost already in line with their reactions.
The question whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolute price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this case that indicate a anti-competitive action, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are probably missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And, logically, the mobile service provider has the monopoly for his network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if one does not go along with this argument, it should be at least a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile providers are noticeably similar.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all suppliers.
The elimination of responsibility for the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS is dissociated from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent adoption of the Telecommunications Act failed to implement the extension of the ČTU's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only too well, but they are likely to have other interests.
It's okay if no one looks at you.
The functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unobserved.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Normally, they are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic companyman who ordered a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile communications providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not happen to the responsible mobile providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, from the activity of these companies they do not have to be neglected profits, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official marketing - unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law allows for such kinds of speculations, despite all that the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card does not run on its name on its phone, so they cannot fully have it as the normal customers of the mobile service providers."
But this alone, the ČTÚ would at least have to be strange.
A further question for the ÚOHS is also opened.
Do the mobile operators close their eyes before such action, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider’s declaration that they know nothing about them and their terms of business would prohibit them.
When the Czech Republic No longer is the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers has brought about a significant price decline in the various services.
In doing so, practically all countries where virtual providers are formed have tried to prevent the formation of classic suppliers virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which in no way tried to protect the interests of mobile telephone providers, intervened in these moments.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and this was followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies all the way to a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile phone market may soon move back into motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the Czech state's day in a ceremony.
The Hymne was newly performed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo singing, choral and instrumental versions.
The song was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The operators of the Hymnenversions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had previously told the Czech radio that he had chosen for the solo variants singers with young, representative voices that are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both, and then with the choir, to keep a clear dictation so that the text could be understood in order to be consistent," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem goes on its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first recorded in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the development of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven State symbols remained after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies will be transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008 will be a date for Prague traffic operators to enter the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Guests can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (as valid from 1 January 2009) at the same time on their chip card, in the information centres and branch offices of the transport companies at the Muzeum Metro Stations, Můste, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Let the cantony, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
The coupons have also been available on the pages of the traffic companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers up to the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places there is also a switch with trained staff available to the traveler, who advises interested persons on the internet and also plays the coupon on the card," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played at self-service machines on the Opencard, which are mounted in some subway vaults.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remembering ticket values, the passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city, but it is to be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls instead of the driver an automatic machine
The operation of the machines that will function from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to insert the chip card, and the pre-acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the main towns and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia enter the capital.
"In the trains that are integrated with Prague, the train companions have read equipment that enables them to check the validity of coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid. This organization compiles the schedules for Prague transport companies.
The suburbs have ticket reading equipment at the ticket desk at the driver's desk.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown at the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position at the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the charged coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the charged coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive out of town buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends, can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information for the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the addition of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is the result of a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we would like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the U.S. presidents in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the US President in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetgaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberator," says a letter signed with the words "people who are heartening the fate of the Sudden".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans, aware of the Czech national character, suspect that they would expect brutality, reluctance, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you can speak to a state that is foreign to us, who is suppressing and trying to eliminate minorities and has done nothing but contribute to the victory of the Allies," read the letter.
The reason why the writers cannot sign is said to be the fear of revenges by the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president had doubts about the attitude of the Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the residents would become part of the U.S. or live under the command of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of the post-war history, it is, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to assume that they would negotiate their expulsion from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the south.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed as a German Budweiser at the Marines on the Baltic Sea during the war.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotion-charged campaign is aimed at motorists
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš , ,ebíček promises to bring drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to remove drivers from too fast driving modes and alcohol from the tax.
And they also remembered being attracted before driving.
The campaign wants to speak mainly of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also proves:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a label.
And in a blood blaze the word "pay".
This means that one can pay for a moment of inconspicuousness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal images with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of fatalities on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whips for motorists
"The motto "Zuckerbrot and Peitsche is valid for the drivers.
Sugar bread means that they save time when driving red for example.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns are necessary in the press and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
Even less effective in his opinion are tables that draw the drivers' attention to a danger.
"If you place a static panel that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flow away with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordan, Eastern Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if one could conclude peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for them.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (placed) territories, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to leave to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include Eastern Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two attacks in the city in July where several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Temple Bears and Holy and Historical Places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Extract from the Golan heights
Olmert spoke out for a withdrawal from the Golan heights of Israel, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to end peace with Syria only on the basis of a deduction from the Golan height," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do with getting back the Golan heights.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship to (shitish) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (schitish) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know it, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the student agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewards and travellers may travel on the bus.
"If we wish to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the spokesperson of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old Stewardess last week was likely caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road to the bus.
At this moment, the young woman sat in all the bad luck next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she still had two more places available.
A bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment where the Steward produces coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays as to whether the bus is equipped with standing positions to the vehicle letter.
If this is not planned on the bus, the travellers will have to sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing positions; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree to the movement of travellers first.
Later this was withdrawn, and we came to a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he told his point of view.
The law doesn't know any Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term ‘car companion’; however, its rights and obligations do not define it’, the minister of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is subsequently covering this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, urban buses with standing positions and a higher speed and long-distance buses without standing positions with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board a plane.
Here too is not sure when turbulences are coming, and the Stewardess can hit the head."
"But when a bus breaks sharp, the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider her profession to be dangerous.
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of the Stewards is risky, I'll take it off.
Coffee and newspapers are available to travellers when they arrive.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of Stewards in his buses. His company, however, operates only a fraction of lines compared to student agency.
"We don't have any Stewardesses, but we're already defending ourselves from the very beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not uttered for Týden.cz quite a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the event of an accident at a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably not turned off from the stand strip and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will expect financial compensation from the debtor.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones during the journey," says Fachmann Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the Stewards to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, stating that the safety of buses lies in the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hopes Rest in Frankfurt
The WestLB Board's letter to the staff of the house is not missing in a large number of words.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurter Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group" can be created, says the letter which became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further bundles in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads if a board of directors wants to demonstrate action in a difficult time.
Because the beaten WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission but also by the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Office, which recently made it clear to the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, that it was time to find a solution to the future.
A connection between the Deca bank, who knows savings bank customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB, however, has been talking for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas had shown his half-year figures at the end of August, he saw no meaning in a merger of the house on the Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca's Board of Directors, which is run half by the Landesbanks and the Sparkasse Associations, has commissioned the Executive Board to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun at the financial court.
Of the Deca Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt’s financial centre, it is not the first time that it is about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the Deca bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba.
However, there was nothing out of this trio.
The plans had hardly become public, the Hessian state government opposed a participation of Helaba.
Also the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been thoughtful games about a connection between the Deca bank and Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba board, had recently spoken out against planning games about joining his house.
However, it seems that the realization that a concentration of the various houses of the public-law sector is doing need seems to mature.
After the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could first approach.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good message.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, the partners will gradually look forward to it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkasse- und Giroverband Hessen-Thuringen, which is involved with 85 percent in Helaba at the beginning of the year, has presided over a bar at the beginning of the year.
==References====External links==
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the crucial question with which business model to ensure the future capacity of the Landesbanken, had not been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, a breakup of the West LB could also stand, but it is self-evidently not desired there.
In the letter of the Executive Board there, it is also mentioned that it is in any case intended to be a "total solution" for the house.
As this can be brought under a hat with the combination of individual units with the Deca bank, it will still show.
The second weekend is known as "Italy's weekend"
For Elena it is the first time for Luca already for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so is everything else, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearer and proves the approximately 200 October-fest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throats.
Elena's gonna give Luca a cup, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the station Puorta Nuova, this evening start at 23.45 am four buses, "destinazione Monaco, Festa della Birra", expected to arrive 6.30 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, on a bus travel only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans sing alongside their flag already, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furzimitate lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, belong to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 22.30.
Last night would mean unnecessary spears, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the ride, the welcome sum with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
The salary will be in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian markings on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich will take another break.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o'clock in the early morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it stands the left "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it says run," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the squares in the rear part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats spread to the same benches in the room!"
The size, roars Marco, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"The security people show that we are acting well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!"
Third, "Today, half past eleven in here again!"
And it's going to be Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready for withdrawal.
It is known as the "Italy weekend" the second weekend of the week.
There is no precise information on numbers; the speech is of 50,000, who are on their way across the Alps and enter the beer tent, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have come extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries a national statistics in which the Italians (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) occupy first place with about 200 medical care.
The farm garden is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intervenes that the German banking sector is not spared by the crisis-like developments.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence on the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should only interest the part they use.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses at the daughter Defpa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the State financeer had extremely short-term refinancing – which is no longer possible because of mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year, revenue from subscriptions to certain securities and from the resolution of reserves in the credit business dropped by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds from downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the refunding of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business provision for Group companies, had the profit-minus dropped by around 16 percent.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated himself with commercial real estate loans, which had then been disbursed in Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of sufficient resources in the classical state funding, the depfa had then increased its commitment to infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the Group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
She had already been shortened by two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure financier since depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market, as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has been largely expanded, as banks have heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part - around 50 billion euros - of the depfa's credit portfolio.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered in the loan in the foreseeable future and the company has been protected by the influence of the currently largely ineligible international money markets.
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstswaltung (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even clear that the funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the late Sunday evening's hearing of the bank was still before the insolvency, at least the temporary rescue could not calm the minds.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 Euro.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite well maintained.
While the priority debt is hardly moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and the durations beyond 2009 are concerned.
For example, if hypo-real-Estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the marked deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, with the acquisition of the depfa, had only taken over the crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-off commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as pensions can be reduced in time.
Or it happens, however, that what at present hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overwhelming with the sub-stateization, the probability of security at present has become only a legitimate hope.
This should, in particular, provide long-term believers with some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use a closing line to make a loss claim for future tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself at the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to squirt: the Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Fortunately, I didn't walk.
At Tachibana, the beginning of teaching does not seem to be as strictly determined as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students ride in from eight o'clock until a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room', starts around twenty o'clock before nine.
But before class began, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, with blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the cult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language already well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been concocted, giraffed and cheeky and persistent I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girl and means "little, sweet."
Then I'll be home to my place quickly.
The girl next to me has grinned quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong was sounding, I was adept at it.
Everyone talked and kiched and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them took off their bentos.
My host mother had made me such a lunch box - that's something different from the odes of German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Mostly I don't have a blower, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's still true that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps, brurr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared bento to a boy, which she then makes especially artistic - hoping to get to know the boy at the break-nack.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited to see if I can see this here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I have been reading mangas for years.
And so that I understand the comics and the culture in them better, I also started some time to learn a little Japanese.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here someday.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, customs and customs.
And on this one, you put great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a shab is fleeing in danger does that mean that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could one check if they feel the same when they behave similar to us?
In the Internet journal " Edge", contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we may at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter an inescapable terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, escapes or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated circuits with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal Cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in other primates and seems to be totally lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic should be the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even though consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, as it may be, may be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness in other animals may look.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, can be analysed based on our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my comments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is more scientifically accessible.
One could investigate the animal consciousness processes without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both might be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the condition of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I take it back that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "purchase" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and, in particular, people.
Related to the linguistic nature, fine classifications of feeling arise because with the help of the words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from primitive activities arise in the body regions of the Cortex and the brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could be involved in cross-cutting sensations.
I can't theoretically contradict this, but I think it can't be established.
Pankseep argues what appears to be a fear in rats and people, probably also in both cases: How can you check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A baby flees in danger of being afraid?
In my eyes, mere behavioral equality cannot yet prove equality of life.
Although neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, they do not even strain a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to the human being, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even scrap (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress is taking place on the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, as well as not sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think that short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than walk against a wall constantly.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Time of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a token of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It may even reduce the number of EM stages from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work with high speed," said Ukrainian President Grigory Surkis.
"UFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and has been replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had come together at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It was "the serious risk that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-classists had been sentenced to a forced drop in the past season alone because of manipulation, and finally even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Annoyed Dennis Quaid Moves Back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outsourced her fiancée Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He foams - and beats back.
Late Rose War at the Ex-Ehäpare Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now carry out an unpleasant argument with each other - all over the public.
Meg Ryan had expressed himself for the first time in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud she had only experienced after divorce.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" was told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out clearly: "It is incredible," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "meg repeatedly chews the story of our relationship and reseals it."
It is also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals which mean divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become father of Zwillingen.
And so close his registrations with the pavement: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's fine."
Reduce prices for flights and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany even cost up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant collapse in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for many years, the nights have already been discounted in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9% in 41 out of 48 European cities compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were by 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "absorbing desire of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
Also in the air prices, the trend in the first quarter showed up:
As a result of kerosene reduction, travellers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices for Economy-Class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in business and first-class were much lower.
In Germany, prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the fall in prices is, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the aviation market is crumble.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement liberalising air traffic between the USA and Europe has provided increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV proposes Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
During the Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning Elf.
By Kristoffer Klein, break landing for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lever on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went to him convincingly about the lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate", Hermann Rieger zished in the cabin course of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break had ended and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV's physiotherapist, enjoying a higher reputation than some flossed actor.
And so his request also found hearing responsible.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and joined the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach of Hamburg.
This command will have been read in a similar way: here with gate two!
There was no implementation.
"There wasn't anything nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it to be "a more relaxed one".
The 1:0 (1:0) owes the Hamburgers to Mladen Petric's headball (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol joined forces.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators had once celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash charts on the video wall, which showed their association as class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate certificate stands more for the incalculability of the league than for the domination of his HSV.
The team with their late commitment – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal shooter Petric and the Jansen, who were taken away by FC Bayern – does not find itself able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
The fear is over at Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break in by 700 points in time.
That was the biggest loss of points within one day in its history.
Later the Dow caught something again.
At 20:30, the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded at 10.579 counters at a minimum of about five percent.

At this time, the biggest loser was in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No titles could be won.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for just under ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers will be provided.
However, the sum should be paid out not on one blow, but on a gradual basis.
In return, the State should receive stock option cards from financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the public funds.

Dark matter influenced flight by space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in researchers has created an intrusion: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of quickly freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sunny Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering about for years, however, is that the aircraft do not behave 100 percent the way one would expect according to the old-fashioned gravitational law.
On the contrary, irregularities occur in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and he tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have made up.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
From it is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter always makes up a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been killed in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
Six hostages were killed in a shooting before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Solubility negotiations are already underway.
Germans always come to the visor of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been killed in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported in the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,' said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling on a German mediator, the release of the hostages delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
For years, abuse by her stepfather has resulted in a woman killing herself has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court found, however, that Mrs Randle, who worked honorably for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Procurator Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and had given up "their life"
In April 2007 her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession, who concluded: "I used to bind her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victims it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unfortunate story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would be ended before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June is accused according to the "public security law".
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the official be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he filed contained classified reviews of Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could face costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million deposits.
Interests on this loan are paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be reimbursed if Bradford & Bingley's loans are cancelled.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged every year to those 700 financial undertakings that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies must obtain 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been cautious during the upturn of real estate are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
Jersey people are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations have been carried out by a consulting firm.
Retailers will decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, Jersey Milk’s wholesale market price last changed in 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied deposit
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a security request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused deposit regarding the charge 50 million Taka ($729,700) to have extorted by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against deposit at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first grant it unlimited freedom.
Correspondents say that although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of their release whether it will be able to continue on its own when it returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's deposit request because it says that she does not have to receive a deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers apply that they require deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, said an Awami Federal President on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-assisted transitional government had taken power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to one UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban promise that thousands of people would not attack or interfere with vaccination.
BskyB loses claim in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing transmitter ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Before that, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and allowed him to have an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed in Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the share of ITV has raised doubts as to the independence of the ITV, which has prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would like to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. public prosecutor's office
The U.S. Advocate General has commissioned a specialist agent to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The reason was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officers of the White House, legislators and former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The special intermediary Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials who were being interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to hinder the judicial system.
In his report, Mr Glenn Fine said that serious accusations including criminal actions have not been fully examined or clarified.
The appeal of a special intermediary with the power to force the witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began in December 2006 when the Ministry of Justice dismissed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the public prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which prompted many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican congress members, while others refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud of the democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are assigned to investigate and persecute judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been arrested for the redundancies and in the final effect has settled his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The General Inspector's report has addressed critically the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, his leadership role "committed" and his "exceptional disinterested" process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honoured for his epic Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer, who will accept his special golden award next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" mentions the nominations for the award of this year after it has come into its narrowest selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matrices as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as a single in the UK and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One among them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing locals to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather like a dusty alley than after an actively used passageway.
There are no signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the longtime neighborhood that says she is fascinated by the short alley, simply because she is one of the remains of the past of the building block.
However, the City Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road, which might be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street was newly paved and seats were designed for, among other things, a café that the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decaying alley and make it a public meeting point," she added, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department for Building Protection, said that it was actually the city's wish to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained something of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm Philip Minthorne belonged to was divided between his numerous children and a narrow striped country was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a practically unchanged divider of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation of city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow culprit that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weeks old newspapers flying through rainy interiors."
With few exceptions, the road looked exactly as recently as one evening.
A rat ran through the rear part of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that according to his opinion some people underestimate the stimuli of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and disgusting.
Bilingual training debate: Education in English-speaking surroundings
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, a leading scientific assistant in California's studies and senior director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and Hispanic students successfully closing the school is lower than in white students" - which is true.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama's educational plan recommends specifically among others a bilingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in schooling.
Let's take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The School of Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach by which training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should pay attention to, says the headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of English language in technical education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only recently come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The services of the school would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational positions within its own party (the national picture associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and their own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently triviated the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully take into account educational models that work instead of despise them and trivialize them.
Oil price decreases as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday because of the fears that even the American recovery plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, the crude oil terminals at the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prizes in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors had already shown concern, even though congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the most recent chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of the Wagovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
After analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place during the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to experience the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts of Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned that the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially in China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption because of the weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for the 2009 oil and gas price fell by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter stand
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been in the Jets jersey for the past eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, where the jets turned a game without results into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
When Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon on which their developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once sprang out as an external defender and the other one after 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't work very hard," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing fishing, the Defense Quarterback Kurt Warner broke up.
Outer defender Darrelle Revis caught an unhappy throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazy one.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe insanity, Erik Mangini, coach of Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Exterior brusselassie beats his world record
Haile Brüsselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some consider him for the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first human being to make the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Brässelassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
In this way, Brässelassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he reached at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, brusselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear that the air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he has signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - berry asis has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Brüsselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Brüsselassie informed the press that two weeks ago he had cramps in his Wade and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All went perfectly.
I took up the training again a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he overly orchestrates his race, generally avoids many world's best marathon stars, relies too much on the race leaders as if it were a race race, and sets world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly hurts the size of brusselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the centre of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge gnashing asis after the tempomakers left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last move to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikiteenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result ever.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikiteenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems that were described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She had planned her course by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out first, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as a third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the straps in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the meadows of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles away from the glistening, loud and gigantic drive, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three rock spots, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaves, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays, it's a pilgrim's place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it remains and remains the city that she describes – and which made her a tourist destination, by recording her in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and privately as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows as little about us that he does not know what is missing from him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many are still suffering from being observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a municipal member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so correctly the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all Hurston here call.
She introduced her home city to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is close to route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the sites of black history and human drama.
Frech like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown -white modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks of any kind sold and what-even fits into hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This certainly wasn't a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about their beauty that were full of sexual play.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewing into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and clothed with pants, in a city that today imagines something on her honorable style of clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was rocking in his chair, on a rear terrace that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized at all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960 she was poor and her books were out.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary, Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wraped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"At this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people who were sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed in it once.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston asked the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as "politically respecting instead of my race".
People today say that although the removal of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teachers in the morning and they hugged his teachers in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You did not embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have turned their backs on prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelf, and again made it part of the American literature canon.
The long way project came at exactly a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again exposed to the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-track highway were bustling the city, accelerating the whole with top speed, awakening real citizens' pride," said Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a bit easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more visits, such as Rachele Munson, a lawyer who has been attending the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly-paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes feel like a hinterland in summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Outside looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval in advance is necessary and certain things - just as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that their shielded community will fail.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of domestic pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed like any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or at the police who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
This is where we are in New York.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefond administrators who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror workday since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push with loud flaps the metal waves along side sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam between apartments, as human packaging animals loaded with around 50 t-shirts, which hang on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bar on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the world's downfall, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty to the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already snakes.
Not at the cash desks to cancel or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank member with license", for the same reason as I was snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places where they were commuting from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They removed money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and quiet Pleite.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities amounting to $327 billion, went to bankruptcy management over and as last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, was Wagovia, another bank that has savings of $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another crash, the office and shop workers who stood in front of me brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have in recent weeks taken the lead in the financial lattice.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took with so much familiarity reference to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite went to the bank and their adorable-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were making fun of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniform concierge of my residential block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to take a ride anymore."
Muslim tombs are damaged while right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of Austria's Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaam's interest, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, painted with a red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of sepulchre at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend on the extremely right-wing party there are significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in one, according to police, organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminals think this is an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hate on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the sepulchre that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is ending.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria, after the country went right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, took part in their election campaign for a strict anti-Immigrant law, and some of their electoral actions were criticized by opponents as an alien enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headcloths and Burkas and even announced his aversion to food, which is generally linked to Islam.
At his final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and the evidence that the extreme rights are the strongest political block in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Block abroad for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star, who has been condemned for the sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Richter filed a six-month barrier after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted it last Thursday to impose a ban on foreign travel after presenting the judges evidence of glitters for prejudicial punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the index for sexual offenders required, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
One speaker from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some of them.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22nd, and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calmed and satisfied that Glitter was held to travel to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no scumbags, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to getting a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternately theatralic plays on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the programme of the month of photography of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing ever bigger from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to express passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to capture with the camera the characters of the greatest flamencomasters'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created, reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby giving the image the modernity and the idea as the farmer understands flamenco: `music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, was and was the firm goal of this work presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and realize it as `Portraits of the veterans of sports' (`SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me great pleasure to photograph the people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or hit people, people you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of the Flamenco today entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name of la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he's writing is 'a raucousness'.
He still doesn't know where the novel's action is and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he's currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'a raucousness' and 'alles points out that he should not write the novel'.
"If I had been sick, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel at some point," he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Premium of the Festival Hay Festival and who gave her voice to most present, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor was not given sufficient time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created from 'exceptional adventure', from 'freude to reading' and from 'more' than before'; how he writes and `discipline' to complement 'the lack of inspiration'', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which 'respect images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano American novelist admitted that there is no way of knowing how to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is 'effects' and 'the human beings are more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave it easy' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfights were partly out.
After the announced bullfights found that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfight with which the feast was to be concluded in Pozoblanco was relocated yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bullfight festival.
Thus, the feast of inconsistencies was suspended, and two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second intended bullfight festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullrings again and again.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which was more successful through galloping than through his bullfight.
And even worse was El Julus, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with buh caterpillars.
In Álava, two people wanted to miss the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport checks in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called the drivers of the car to stop, and they took the escape.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of Hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the riders, the man 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of the Basque State told her.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when traffic police officers in the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed the city area of Armiñon.
It decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometres on the edge strip. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally collected one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of Hascheh, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and the weighing of the bundle to other police departments.
The officials also found that the mark was double, so that it did not match the registration mark in the car monkeys, which is why it was also arrested for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., he was sent to a police station for hearing. He will be shown to the detainee in the next hours.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking hole in Montecito in a rather strange way, California's traffic police spokesman reported the magazine `People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through 'to 4:30 p.m. Gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking hole, and as she drove backwards, she caught herself several times on her sunglasses'.
A little later, the witness who at the beginning probably didn't know the actress that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had lived 'Angst um Locklears'.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car standing across the street blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be unorientated', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperatively, excessive drinking pleasure was excluded from the first moment. "Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," says the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and taken to a local investigative body at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Lamazares pointed out what approach the party must face to the one who has so far been sitting as a city council in Seville City Council.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the regular infringements that Silva might have begun: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency’.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation of 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment in filming.
In this way, the Cinemat has tried to depict a multitude of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
'Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and will later be shown on the broadcast Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film at the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-off possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of 'confused Spain', which the false leader of the struggle sought, because the people had been brought back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not expect financing like `Alatrise' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he appeared on stage to the actors with whom one must first try before starting to spin and for those who had not made casting he `devil' and respecting, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide assistance in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many performers, who he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo', must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Site mesas de billar francés' nor the selected film `Los girasols ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'At the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for those who thrive, and now you're satisfied when you've produced a movie,' says Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana, and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and sat for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
This woman's life, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We're not trying to tell about their lives without preserving their Esprit," said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly', for example, occurred to me like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area," she claims.
The production is calculated with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in 'La pierta aberierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-girlfriends.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola by Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the accompaniment of the artists who were Divas in whom he always loves."
This work also tells of the life of this woman, who became known in places such as India, the United States or Russia and, moreover, throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works no one can appreciate today, and that' says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the `Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize and the day of death of the two.
'The Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia's house museum and with the exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was reached in various places in Andalusia, now New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council of Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernerero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The US can misrepresent itself without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then ruling idea of American cinema, which was left out of the scene, came from America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what it cost him to give the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest dross of his life.'
No one was afraid to make or exaggerate.
As a father of cinema and fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market, in which the lowed self-esteem of the US is on the hopeless search for reasons to hold back dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only few people can be admired, then you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he virtually embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses both: from the foundation, which has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose, was founded to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it took him a lot of effort to fight a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement proposes to take home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a human being died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar laureate, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`Uns has left the greatest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who are trying to live today as Paul Newman lived: high demands of justice, a responsible private life, lead far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filed at home?" he often shaved himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'From all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the faithful spouse, the loving Father, the attentive Opa and the Philanthropist', they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it might be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called a perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything and that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it would clearly not have happened.
But, we're going through everything from the start.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to go first.
I don't seem to be bad either, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it true that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is inconceivable in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had been successful once, but to recover it would be more difficult.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it seemed to be an attempt to organize a people’s uprising and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have a few 500 people pneumonia, and some like me because of this chip that I've got, will not even appear in time for classification, I can already think that the output has been misprinted.
Of course, if I were to be asked about a perfect road, this road would never come into my mind.
So I think we will dream for a long time about a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, but which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system considers what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the present after the talks in the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that talks with her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, you talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial waste, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement when you consider that Microsoft added some function and extras in Windows versions.
The direction change is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sended many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to function at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the `Windows'.
What do half of the existing applications serve?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, less excessive, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt. I offer a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drink machine is attached a shield: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used the web for research.
By the way, last week has also been confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to simultaneously bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso owned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is one of a well built parish priest.
When we begin to list the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
In principle, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it `tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name formation is connected with sport and is derived from Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex-snap and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that these t-shirts have as detail at the neckline.
And respect, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of `tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, Cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
You're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monthica Cruz is lovely, but full of joy in life.
Currently the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monthica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the mango company, then moved to his residence and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner of Valentino's honors.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and watch women dressed in the way they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was a kid, I've been thrilled by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in lessons and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of actors.
Finally, everything is interconnected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, that's it.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman will mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think you're gonna be a mother, right?
For a long time now, I already know that I am going to be a mother because it requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I'm going to give my child great feelings of happiness and make it up with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year were shot.
That's exactly the way it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and wants to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went to the walkway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our mango collection have been auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGOs.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that she doesn't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will also do that.
In order to support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers, who can be reprehensible because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level installs this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in the drunken state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not jump on.
The initiative has already been announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project which will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
Apart from the public prosecutor's experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automotives will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were more than once shown under alcohol as a result of driving.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents car start when the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the regulatory infringements already in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 human lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it became a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the future, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, and this has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time of the programme, next to the presidencies of Benito Chihuahua de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced them to use their hand as a parasol to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something
No, she's the Spanish woman, but she's lived here for a few years.
-Ah so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who is the prince and the prince of Asturias and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 soldiers from the Navy, who give away the avenue of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair woven by the wind, without ordinary ‘peep-toes’, may have been told that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official succession is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter is waiting for them from Mexican television who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much excellent fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with money of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango branch at Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the idea of thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because recently his brother died, broke himself together. He put on the suit of the fashion house and had some jewels of ELAH that were breathtaking. He held at the arm of his son Luis, who was nearly two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended with the baron of red shield without jackets, because Jackets borrowed the ladies.
Monthica Cruz, has rushed to the business and had a pants and shirt that she had modeled herself, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand play'.
Inés Sastre, she did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own beddings and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Counsel against Stress
There are not 1000, but one way more to forget chaotics' everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7:00 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of coming back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two ways to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems that are being overcome from the working world.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga sessions, classical massages or spa treatments, Susanna Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas of work with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as to how to stay in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your vein no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be startled, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and adolescents.
Sure, more than one of you was told that you talked at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other appearances in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic fears at night, enuresis noctura (beds at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations, or exaggeration.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite an opposite (scream, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and thus develops.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g., with the sleep apnoea or with the stress).
What can be done is to perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to cause the child to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressy television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
Once the talk occurs in sleep, try to keep the peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if a couple of appearances show up, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not that usual), the child does not put pressure on them to carry out a hearing and get more information out.
So you won't be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that's only a few minutes.
Illhouses... finally.
After a long thirst track, Illhäuser on the field is finally back on success course.
Without a great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torches and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers tried to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot passed close to the angle, Illhäusers were to dominate the game with ease and, alternately, managed to challenge the defense of Denmark with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foottip.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two torches fought by Riahi and Temporarye, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to accept a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illegitimate goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and should be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his teammates were forced to continue playing in a paying manner.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not address any major problems to an ill-haeusian Elf, which only a little withdrew to condensate their defenses, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
In view of the decisive attitude of fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Giulianec in Finistère on Tuesday morning in order to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive mind' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, in order to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and secure the working conditions and payments of sailors.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they led to the Morbihan and Calvados protest marches that caused congestion of nearly ten kilometres of length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered with a barrier.
Already on Monday the sailors expressed their determination by burning from the early morning on tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishcutter did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique disbanded the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
That, from Boulogne-sur-Mer, decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Committee on Crisis in Giulianec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not yield in any way' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 on the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes resigned from the film legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its 2008 supply forecast
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, has completed its 2008 supply forecasts with 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of scale from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider issuing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were put forward to it.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and retirement benefits in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from the AIG.
One of the assets from which AIG might possibly separate is its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, explains FT.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the most of its sales in order to repay over 85 billion loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Chamber of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks, a historical case of the courses: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nastag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the decline in trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final payoff figures, the index Nastag, mainly technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used index standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,06.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was once again to enable some stability on the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205, the Members rejected the funds he had asked for from the Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Almost two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here a bad picture is being put into circulation, which represents Congress as unable to accept a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come `to be too late'.
'If the project is actually condemned for failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, note, Red) and other central banks to take control of the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more," warned Brian Bethune, Chief of Economics at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day, which has been removed, will bring about the ruin of a financial company' in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy the bank shops of Wagovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are not only facing an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Over the course of ten years, the proceeds of the state funds fell from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the revenues within 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV duel
On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another one to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duet, which was to be pursued by one third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite decent, was not 'brilliant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll was published on Saturday, says Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecided voters, i.e. those to whom it comes now, Obama came out with 39% as winners from the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, emphasizing clearly the 'neutrality' of his opponent regarding these issues that were at the heart of this first television world.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he emphasized several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president' he also assured.
An attack point, which has been preached in the Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without being put out of the picture.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood Obama, on the other hand', opposed this weekend a democratic election campaign in which Republican was accused not to have grasped the full extent of the crisis that burdened on the 'American from the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama last night implored 20,000 people who had gathered in the rains on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middlestand' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a crucial turning point' yesterday, the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer estimated.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the good economic instincts of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After stressing once again that he might even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, had the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully address the questions on the plan to save the financial market for over $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unloved by the people.
Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositionals demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white races gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the electoral venues in Minsk's marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator is to step back'.
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: 'What does this do if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the suspension of certain assets, could be abolished if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the narration," lamented Juri Potemkin, representative of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move to Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of votes cast appears too high, and that the extension of the voting levy in advance (26% of Minsk voters) gave the way for any kind of manipulation.
Have you noticed that a election took place?, the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the election halls.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night is falling again over Octoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulated on their success.
Persuasion - From the blood that got safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its President, Dr Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Given this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, who had the objective of bringing light into the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and working out guidelines to prevent a renewed disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to give his report, at that time several provinces set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood canneds in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Due to the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says before she proudly emphasizes that almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted according to the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of human form of cattle in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
"And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So let us call on one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which we believe is to use exclusion measures, if you don't know this and if a disease progresses slowly, as it is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, blood was not taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, some years ago, without any doubt, this disease was proved to be transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we used has a meaning.
In 1999 a much more precise technology was published on the market to detect HIV: The nucleic acid tests (NST) which enable the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was reduced significantly.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS via blood transfusion.
Nowadays, one out of 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV infected blood.
In other words, you need to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canned every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transmitted over a blood can.
I think that today you can feel comfortable getting or writing a blood transfusion in order to restore health, says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec needs to provide sufficient care in addition to safe supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood patches.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, includes only 3% of the population of Quebec, suitable for blood donation. '
In doing so, any healthy person 18 years of age or older can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available are not accepted because they are ill, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded for one year.
With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate any more blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation, Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood preserves but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heartbeats, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank of Quebec.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains rich blood stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to reduce more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood loss as very popular.
Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the Half Final
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the sounds from Seattle, has qualified for the semi-final round of the first league of the U.S.L.'s first league due to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the sounds from Seattle.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first half without a gate for both one and the other side, midfield players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let us remember that in the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburbs of Seattle had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semifinals, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate a 3 to 1 deficit in the backgame in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps entered the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Platanec, and Andrej Kostitsyn, the unit, formed the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Pleganec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of the shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I feel comfortable.
"He has been too attached to it in the first half of the year, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out initiating elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party General Assembly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected to the current sub-election.
'Move the course of our last big border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi's, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mines, from Quebec looked at in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the electoral period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused, by the way, to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he had announced that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister supposedly has for Quebec, namely 'the new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most some prospects of what more could be worked on: especially on water energy, the forest, but especially on mining, by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This area twice as big as France's `is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us," he stressed how to show clearly that he's looking for a national founding dream to realize.
Quebec has grown very much due to its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had made a thermal break to look at the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec area, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, told the Prime Minister of the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a borderline in which there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is open to me to return to this attitude on behalf of the government', he said.
Moreover, with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north," he explained and spoke about the north-west passover, which will be available all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal with them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already started deliberations at some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land treasures) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'man will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have been thinking about transforming the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the ever-increased themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of Beauharnois' power plant in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading that has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future', said Jean Charest.
The press took the form of another conservative project this time, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its start-up was planned for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I intend to be with it," he entrusted his party members with what caused those coincidence storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also 2009, has indeed not yet excluded the possibility of holding this autumn a choice which is possible from the law.
He stressed that his timetable was full, however, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend gave the Liberal Party chief a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the constitutional objectives', which were adopted without any doubt: the PLQ especially calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canada and telecommunications, and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition included the guidelines of the Nord plan with skepticism.
The chief of the Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought back the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to apply it.
If she had done so, we would have gone much further today, Mrs. Marois judged her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption by the government of a North plan.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea', said the party leader Sébastia Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A degraded country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' Minister (which irony) in the Harper Cabinet was who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbur that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing with a government that has not brought home its fellow countryman caught in Guantanamo concentration camp as the only one from all the countries concerned.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened that were accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and removes a child soldier from it under inhuman conditions.
The only one who falls into a judicial parody to assess the defendant's fault.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the association of Canadian lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to the torture: little is interested in the fact that after so many years of torment, a young adult will surely be mentally broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here a mysterious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that word that Harper constantly wears like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so unthinking from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morale: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily mistreated, tortured and imprisoned, quite according to the guise of a chief of government, who is still only supported by the minority until today (may he belong entirely to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has denied itself what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this slogan, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwell Talk
In her September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This is confirmed, and pursues an orthodox logic that the world's largest gold-winning society sought a slanderous complaint of more than six million against three authors and a small medium-sized publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely silenced by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to take everyone into the ruins who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic of these uneven struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a common settlement that makes the opposite side mouth-to-mouth and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually held through the exchange of ideas and not by batons.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had revealed their books and files and opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, while at the same time denying the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing this primarily because she rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the `public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed the authors of Noir Canada, in which she requires them not to use that term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's action is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the sense of truth, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denys the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to deal with debates and inconsistencies and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate action of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it is proposing, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit this kind of unjust actions.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leading congress members, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, which is to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main contents are: improved control by Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new facilities to reduce the number of houses pledged due to payment residues, and the right to monitor salaries paid to the management staff of the assisted enterprises.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present during the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street," declared the Democrat.
'This is the basic point: If we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,' explained the Republican Jew Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on investors' moods.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves more than advocates of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions, especially those designed to enable owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the executives of the companies saved by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the lack of responsibility of certain persons, this is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he said to the American television stations.
When asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we all have to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding into other forms of spread bonds (PCAA), and finally led to a freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican Members was the one who made the first attempt to reach agreement fail last week.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies should only be secured and not bought by the government, one believes that the Sackgasse is escaped.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added a provision that states that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to retain its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President sees it as necessary.
The further 350 billion will have to be agreed by the Congress in a renewed vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in case of profits, which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the lending procedures relating to the housing which are linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the management staff of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were other votes against yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'All obviously Washington doesn't understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Board's Finance Commission, to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in the process of asking taxpayers to pay them to the cash register.
Democrat Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the 'Caucus of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred award-winning professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider which way to go," he declared yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again given the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor in major difficulties since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risk-rich real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive an electoral right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times announce themselves. '
During this time, on the other hand, the British government was just about to get a bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy up the British bank's stores and customer accounts.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to govern since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitiveness, sensitivity and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a state of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a big continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the effects of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema he golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he for a long time was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic convention.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and an hungarian mother.
From his European roots should arise one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before having success in the theatre, television, and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who was second in 1979 at Man's 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he and the actress Joanne Woodward had lived in a showy relationship since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reticent, committed and oversensitive star to the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles you will never completely solve.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his big roles were played.
More than half a century American filmmaking in constant change moves with it.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) again moves into memory, and the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot tabletop filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is called up to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who at his high age is disturbed by a wedding who did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, after his death was taken up again and the Newman made it well known in 1956.
This friendly Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), who was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and reviling billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rosssen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
Still he.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as a Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as a patron of the Irish mafia in Road to Performion of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn early enough from the movie world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his wealth, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flowed for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, fever, or desperate one, with the perfect representation of which he reflected his slipping off and his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle woman portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son to this in 1984, a work full of tenderness and sadness.
During the flood of honours yesterday about Newman, Robert Redford, his close friend and former companion of arms (they had taken hold together in The Sting and played in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid): 'His presence has improved my life and that country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential features of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Driften Hollywood, is on the way.
We may have seen him with our foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, standing in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this for quite tasteless, even though we at first still found it funny.
The profits from his sales still flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations in the criminal trial against János Supplies and his complicities began.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participating in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and of other criminal acts, including falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often carried out with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly entered into the Fiatal Baloldal organization's cash offices, partly in the private funds of individual companies.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tendering funds were made and the associations were not to have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices are to have been falsified.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market by Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János Supplies.
In the course of this "experimental tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills of consumption to be issued later on these submissions for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
Most of these accounts are to have been manipulated by István Lados and his complicit, András  ari, the latter having been responsible for the constitution of the reports in question according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "Examining Tour" was a beer shop.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyptület.
Now, however, the boss of the company says that such a large group would not have been able to fit in at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 at the Foundation Jobb Jöv, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the billing counterfeiters did not seem to have any limits as far as the Pigal Kft. was concerned, a gastronomy company whose accounting records of the customers Jobb Jöv,ért and Hoppá did not even appear at all.
As Managing Director Gy, Mr Farkas informed the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that this was fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from flaws of form, the fact that the company should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Also stated on the bill of catering, the restaurant has not been in service for a long time.
They have also failed to verify that the Budapest Travel Office, which they have taken to visit, only offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash account, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as noted during the investigations, they also referred to VAT in the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are value-added tax-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jöv, since the operation will be charged only 15 percent of VAT instead of 25 per cent, and only machine invoices will be issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been interrupted by the "report investors" was the fact that in one case they had declared "warn transport" as performance, although this was not offered by the company specialized in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - incorrect billing format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXL. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors charged that they never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is the falsifier at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in resolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egypt was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued themselves.
Consciously Forged
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the foundation Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is also intended to have cooperated with the supplement and co. In 2003, the GmbH is expected to supply the Foundation Jobb Jöv,ért Alapítvány, as well as the Associations Atlas Egypt and Voorösfeny, Egypt with falsified invoices of HUF 5 million, which are related to non-delivery services.
However, there was just as little movement of payments as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the parties had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company will have issued several invoices on the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is supposed to have function as a buyer of these invoices.
Managing Director of this company was a Romanian to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has issued invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the associations Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have their equivalent value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos investment Bt. are to have been founded by Romanian Moorers on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies was active, which, according to the defendant, was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his complicit, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued on behalf of the companies invoices to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlas and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubatov will have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million, in the name of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice and VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have abused even the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forint each, but used these amounts for alien purposes.
To cover this, they have presented the TMA five fictitious bills of the Works Team Kft..
These invoices were ensured in the course of the examination of Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, a number of defendants are now charged with a statement on the practice of counterfeiting of invoices, as they were already made before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if János Supplies to a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had repeatedly promised to report extensively on everything, his confession still stands out.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have completed a pact with him on the reparation of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge is willing to take over the responsibility in return.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the "injured" after his attempts to alleviate the arrest and house arrest had come upon deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic offences and who have not paid them, are on their free foot, or at least under house arrest, the possibility remains denied.
The psychology of surrender - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economics researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves in competition, such as auctioning on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
During both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of Striatum, a complex below the cirrhosis, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which the opponent's surrender plays an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase could be explained by avoiding overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars reward in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which in the case of a lost game was also lost.
The difference between the two groups thus consisted merely in the emphasis on one being on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "opposite losing" group were ready to go beyond those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions has so far been based only on the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be visited?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e. g. sperm, sheath secret or saliva).
Travellers are recommended vaccination against the viruses A and B anyway, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms in hepatitis A occur approximately two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by unwelling, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Afterwards the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery may last for up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people die from hepatitis B, which has been caused by liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every 10th infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated liver cirrhosis and liver cancer can result.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspection, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the home doctor with the first signs of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, the virus can be exterminated, thereby preventing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As latest research shows, religious faith acts like a type of "smart" which should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent belief in God affects human pain, reported the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, besides scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participated.
When trying, the subjects were attached to the left hand a sparkling device, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would create some kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's image because it was hardly distinguished from the other painting and felt calming.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while looking at either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "concerned" and they had felt "rest and peace".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused by other, highly active images among the atheists, but one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find an image that causes very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and also do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell me about you
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with virtue and right: she is in the pockets of the people just as she has over her heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their vacation, to which specialists they go, and what they are moving.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets them judge: these would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal, according to which they want to "order all the information of this world".
Schmidt stated that after ten years of changing world work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asking about the Status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago enables the visitor to save his own search and later access it so that the hits can later be generated much more precisely, and on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which works as a cause of fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the desire for power that in many Internet users violates.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of this was recently the approach against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided information to the Brazilian government collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought against the FBI, was able to breathe up to personal rights concerned users: therefore, Google cannot be forced to publish information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms, has been reserved for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere by using the Google services, the company is appalling with the outrage that is proper to the conservativeally performing companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to receive identification codes in contrast to Microsoft and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has become the center of attention, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
For the "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, the users leave deliberately traces and use the available communication channels, and even though the dimensions are different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect them through other services such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and can finally integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can create blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of the last night, the girlfriend will soon find out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will be released because in his blog he makes only too honest his anger about corporate governance air - one thing is certain: The term "private" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he gives himself - so in such a way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopol, can do that - such as Scrooggle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, deliberately leaves no traces behind.
Not a few people deliberately register not on community pages so they can't be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with with with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion, however, is waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the more quickly introduced services prepare not only Microsoft but also other software developers headbreaks.
Critic viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the Group Management has rejected a protest from the employees completely after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten have doubled, and the management also said that the staff’s multi-time catering is too expensive. But all of this seems to be very mild against Google’s even getting to know before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreeing to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again be a lot of focus: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provide the material - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best of Orwellian ways, in which a human being will be alarmingly approachable thanks to Google data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in trace treatment
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping with the removal of the tracks, the spokesman of the Borsod Police Commissioner informed us on Tuesday.
The young people were agreed and are currently charged with the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a sentence of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several persons out of greed.
In the course of the investigations, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into an area in Ózd where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long time - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden from the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange presents purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About EUR 200 million, or EUR 5 billion Czech Krones, has offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange stock packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15", the offers of Poland include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner of all the interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke on Tuesday about the "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe we owe to the US President, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to bring his own party to the draft law to one that would bring something relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-serious investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September".
Part of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and below it will suffer the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after voting in Congress, it threatens the danger that Washington has no political means to manage crises.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, is the Geneva "Days-Anzeiger".
Although some countries could still make rescue packages available to their money institutions and save the banks with the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there is going to be more banks, no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weak money institutions, the Vienna "The Standard" remembers. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are more and more realistic that according to Americans, European taxpayers should now take a bit deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami across the old continents.
Although the "saviour" would not immediately have to "swipe" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to observe in which case it would be reasonable to take the money from taxpayers to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers from Hummeln were inspired in the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the B23C type-controlled biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protector's shield", said Kazuhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can be seen in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the compound eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place instinctively.
"If it wasn't that way, the robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyauki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to be done in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to bees, it can only be two-dimensional, not up, down, or even diagonal, only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the rotational movement, or the acceleration and deceleration of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is based on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which is estimated by Nissan to be in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the target.
A name for the disabled child
Now there is the written version of the 700 billion-dollar rescue package law, which will apply at several stages and will aim at purchasing the poor loans from banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, after multi-day debates, members of the congress went through an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in the American House of Deputies, and said that we only have to bring the agreement to paper.
The compromise on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson concluded: The programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but you have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about driving the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington time Sunday evening 8am (Central European Time Monday 2am in the morning), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives voted first on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy in 2008, and the Senate is in line.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the Bush Administration's initial recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of failed securities with loans.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with an immediate availability of 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit-loaded, poor securities and the President is to decide on the next 100 billion USD.
The programme is reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combined tactic: at the same time it may buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages charged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funding of concern and the companies pay the corresponding fees.
Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger money institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
The chiefs of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can, however, expect to be reduced by the government by their completions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salop.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
In essence, the reduction means that if the ministry buys an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed, unless the bank manager who has been served is transferred to the pension.
In the case of direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively switch on to ensure that the managerial salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in managerial salaries are regulated by law, said Democratic Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The state gains equity rights in participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank is again better.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to the Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapses of Wall Street.

No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th January, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "all this depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced into overseas in time."
However, it also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over to the "Middler Merit Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also conduct talks with the foreign policy consultants of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After day-long marathon consultations, the government Congress and representatives announced on Sunday morning that they had come to an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the upswing of the frozen credit market, have been on the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the opponent in each case to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic topics, while McCain's High, who provided him with the presentation of Vice-Presidentate candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted down at the same time.
On Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We need to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC McCain said: "We will all have a hard time... but nothing is definitely no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the creation of a control commission for the Finance Minister, as well as the restriction of the executions for top managers - something that he passed on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the representative of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law already on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - thus commenting "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (Mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys its fathers".
According to the renowned politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
Epoch break is also a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the desperate hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell under the fifty-percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, so still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation consistently operated by the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly estimated themselves at the pace. But without any impact, secularization, educational success, the continuance of East and North Germans in the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain the loyalty of the CSU constituencies.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters inside the camp became more critical and self-evident.
It is striking that in the last few weeks, the classic citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, commercial citizenship and voters with Abitur as well as university graduates.
The CSU's support fell to under 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper Wiener Zeitung reports on the chaotic domestic policy situation in Austria after the new elections in her "Who with whom?
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates in public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards be seen.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal countries and in the social partners' society this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Molter course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to interfere with the internal concerns of the EIA.
Whether his party goes into opposition or coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed by ÖVP-internal.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black, we are willing to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being directed by the EU Presidency France today.
In its speech addressed to the Plenary Assembly, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz member of the European People's Party, particularly the educational segregation, pointed out that it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and is also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The High Level Conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European civil protection and equal opportunities organisations.
As reported by the Press Office of the Fidesz EP Members, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job-seeking, Roma would primarily be forced out of the labour market due to their low level of education.
"The majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a university degree".
In addition, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right which would play a key role in the establishment of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that these links become aware of the widest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student begins school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and turnover tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members stated, a common, goal- and trade-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of deregulation in the education sector, which is essential to correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka asked.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the provision of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October will decide on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein
Despite the electoral debacle, there are no heads yet; at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Chief of the Party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace lasts.
On the fate of Tandem after the disastrous 17-percent vote loss, the extraordinary party day is decided on the last week of October.
However, the much-sold duo already made it realize that it doesn't want to stick to her armchairs.
They want to preserve the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bederian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was "one-regulator" in Bavaria for 46 years, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructurings, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Agrarian Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free voters" exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate comes in the same way that with the list "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature whose anti-stoire appearances the Huber-Beckstein Duo first exploited to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far drew the threads from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called the 28th of September the "bitest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - he thought the CSU should have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of strength, Merkel cannot again become chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who did not make a heel out of her disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that the CSU's terrain loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best results in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, no member of the opposition was elected to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but OECD suspects illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party assembled under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, in the unclean elections and thanks to a change of constitution, had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in 2006, would "allow" some of the opposition members in Parliament to do so.
For this reason, the ODS has even removed from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent on Russia, thanks to rising prices in the import of natural gas. Even loans were received for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline, which is the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the context of the expectations of the opposition, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians had banned entry into the EU due to the anti-democratic political system.
The OECD evaluation report of the elections, in which emphasis was placed on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided for temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's quick report on Monday criticised the campaign - which means that oppositionists should not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize a improvement in the political system: political prisoners were, for example, set free, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse the recognition of the independence of the sub-Saharan Georgian provinces of South-Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, which has been considered independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our sheet.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "mighty people have been afraid of leaving even a oppositionist in Parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protests in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems to fight here - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones," said Milinkevich, pointing out that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the Lukaschenko regime, whose sole merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it's just a matter of time until the "social security" that is reminded of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the actions, and not the words." Hence, the absence of the opposition is a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on we're being breakfastd before work"
For the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, there are rotating doors for the entry and exits of the officials.
From this day on, the action against those slugs will come into force, which will first stamp off and then take coffee drinks during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Threwable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta emphasises again.
With the Chigi Palazzo, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
Masi says: "The choice of turnable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from officials, the Secretary General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
So all in all there is no breakfast during working time anymore; ending with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile on this: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles".
At a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome states that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"These wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as in the private sector and far beyond inflation".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to address Brunetta's decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the public service ministers are profiling themselves with figures on lower reductions in work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active fables' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public officials have joined forces to explain the wrongful standards of the decree to war."
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is being fought for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and other aspects of the reform of the minister.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 accidents at work, three people die, and 27 people remain unemployed for life.
For 2007, the Inail data (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal work accidents were around 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders arise.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will go on the 58th national day for victims of occupational accidents, so as to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data transmitted by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention at work," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associzione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevent work, protect injured workers, support for the families of victims and raise awareness of public opinion".
"An angry "basta" has raised itself up to this; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their scale, trigger some vortex in the media and participation of the public. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat itself in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: there must be decisive investment in education and information."
The many initiatives for more direct awareness in school frameworks are of particular importance to young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness. One must put and improve a legislative standard in force.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of death caused by work creates an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on determined rules which aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of deaths caused by work is far too high," emphasizes President Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy in the end."
"How do you think you're basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight by various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting school."
"An additional effort is needed - he adds - as regards communication and the awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in need of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of work" and advocated "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident will not depend on voluntary or random donations decided by a legislator from time to time".
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices such as Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report published in Brussels today.
"From the report, it is stated in one note, it is clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music for at least five years every week for more than one hour in the day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, damage their hearing without knowing it irrevocably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – according to the Eu – show a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What really matters is to raise awareness and make this information common to consumers.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems again so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
In view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people, Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee.
"The scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that there is too much concern and that the European Commission, together with the other European members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
A European standard already exists, which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise.
You can limit these damage very much, in which you can reach solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise suspension.
In its report, the Eu Scientific Committee points out that if the users of portable music devices listen to music only five hours a week (sounder than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum sound level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross the border with music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This thus amounts to 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, we're due to pass in March, we're going to have a balance sheet in June.
This is the procedure set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of the capital Rome. The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the management lines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Town Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent, and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," said Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political representatives of the City and Municipal Council remain responsible.
There is no redistributive of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a time-limited endpoint.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the Commission's competence because they lack any liability, Alemanno says: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often policy-making to deal with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The Mayor of Rome places great importance on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think about. It will employ the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemanno "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step towards the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the USA and who had relations with the competent Islam (and still does this as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very bold: he thinks he will receive the highest position of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; all say Obama will win with a great lead.
Even in this case, people are there talking to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the USA that has been kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our cake, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will migrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the definitive weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain to those responsible for information because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arise from the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to assemble the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, does not significantly shrink.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local sector, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes.
The most important publishing groups are on their way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "Killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today exists between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current theme in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, the employers offer like it to them and so it will be a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors get very high wages very often, the editor on the other hand can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, including pensions and insurance.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so many after the third, to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, often become "sick" in the course of the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: REPORT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second court court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked him to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation on the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (as the prosecutor had spoken out) could enable him to influence his society and get evidence from him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar package: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the current edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the process sets out the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always benefited the state institutions and the business community and won those neoconservatives that are "conservatives in Washington" and the financial world hostilely, especially in the south and the center of the States voters.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, which has just been mentioned, is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the USA, even throughout the West, and perhaps beyond this will be affected by these.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that finally take shape under these new conditions and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard of renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to behave with the families concerned, which is also a huge electorate.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism thus seems to have lost its right to speak: the EU has given clear evidence of this, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US can be saved without outside help.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore two non-exhaustive conditions – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the national element is, moreover, perfectly consistent with the ever greater importance recently linked to a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we were so convinced that we have long entered into a networked whole realm, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of immaterials, that we must at once see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but still on the extreme are connected with a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
That is why the person who has such a territory is in favour of another person who lives in a non-fertilizing, waterless or free area of oil.
I now come to the second novelty, but it requires a brief introduction.
Anyone who has a government, who says politics, says this also leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over existing guided tours, including those of the economy that have emerged as inadequate and full of shade zones.
Finally, there is a profoundly rich and, in a sense, still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an indebtedness, an image of incomprehensiveness, a feeling of distance that is all geared to an entire class of managers in the western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among much of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority being more and more foreign and present.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of the democracy of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate revolution of the collective state of mind of the past: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of American Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value as to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today, and is even stronger from the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerating to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The Superkleber, which makes to go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now almost at the target.
With a adhesive applied on a surface of just 2.5 m2, researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be presented as a series of pipes arranged in a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic fairy tales that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sand paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holdability of the feet of reptiles and at the same time "problemless to remove from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
TO MAUERN ENTLAGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
How to get into the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nano tubes are also the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could be included in the space sector.
So for the moment the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER PART OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new adhesive species.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always preserves a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, as they can affect the absorption of these by the body in an extreme way.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again struck alert: it is enough a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of the patients is at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDIAMENTS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix two years ago and stressed that what is being drunk in combination with such drugs as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT FOR GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicinal products.
The list of active substances heated by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the University Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert of the ana agency emphasizes.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is given to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for the history of the USA than the attacks.
A prediction that was not given little polemics in response and that was kept before the economist years later, but today proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared from the public perspective as part of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economie of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style directed particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelances and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the audience with some new innovations: in addition to a revised and now more spartanic initial menu, finally a reason for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
It was also against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e-mail sending. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the site.
In this way, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expands the typical graphics of Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: Tables can now be edited by different users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each processor is assigned a question to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
Outside for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, the free movement of costs may be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in the private households, and it is precisely in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: finally, different institutions of public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even business prospects are opened.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at an displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of more known access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Cold tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new Dopingfall opens on the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe newspaper on its website.
The 26-year-old kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who has been tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was done by the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those made in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded for two years from the race.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME INSTITUTIONS: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAMEWORK: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with resistance.
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to racism in Italy and about the fall of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a package of cookies.
The case testifies to what the times call the "Paradix of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest level of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Times is calling for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also underlined the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euro per room rental prices
The market for flats for students knows no crises.
According to the last investigation by the Sunia, the tenant company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious challenges. Whole groups of students are losing their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level," said Sunia's responsible Laura Mariani, "in these cities the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rent limit, illegal rental.
In the case of Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which result in lower rent prices due to the revision of taxation.
When considering the investigation it turns out that a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed in Milan about 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the Nere district of Bande) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a sleeping space of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
The rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome are only a little lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid outside districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping space and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vonero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping space costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: renting that is 25-30% higher than the average is demanded by foreign students.
Again to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-story complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the hall cinema in the center. A process that not only appears to be inevitable and irrevocable but also carries the lives of a cultural crime.
In most cases, historical places are filled with memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've put back a piece of street full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburbs kinos and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably lost cinema world.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; for the most part, these stamps paid the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main innocent are multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has led the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are ready to visit instead of the old one multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here is still the missing budget for the fund of the trade association eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be necessary in the year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and to park at more favourable parking charges.
"It's a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, however, we also need better audio and video equipment to work against the superpower of multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of Baghiera's "Supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to form the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia Group.
The charges of the Anti-Mafia Authority's lawyers against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for dealing with mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken into account: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros because of the involvement in criminal associations of the mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disregarding," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for advisory activities."
"The Mafia Group had thus been allowed – as the judges said – to enter the town halls on an official basis and to agree with the public administration policy."
The president of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is all but an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of mafia is greater than in others where such connections are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli, Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been disbanded.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the mid-right coalition after the election of May 2006.
He cried scandal as the prefecture ordered the disintegration of the council.
He was interested in it in Marco Minniti's Deputy Minister, whom he claimed to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the Dal Torrione case studies, the willingness has been shown to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, which is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy emerges from the waves, suddenly the big ones run on
It is a non-exhaustive source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and only now do these seem to be the great energy companies in the world to understand.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and also looking for octopus, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; not by chance these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy demand could be covered by the ocean waves' energy.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would come.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility of working with us."
This is about the procurement of approval from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is not an underestimating sign, especially when considering that oil continues to be funded by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology still in progress, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather small and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment need to be developed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses for example a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which move the buoys up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
It drives a turbine, which in turn runs a generator.
The current is then sent via underwater lines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a parking space with the help of undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tide drive the turbines which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery Research, a particular interest immediately deserves the potential that lies in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
Especially the tide energy is what states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states made it possible to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
