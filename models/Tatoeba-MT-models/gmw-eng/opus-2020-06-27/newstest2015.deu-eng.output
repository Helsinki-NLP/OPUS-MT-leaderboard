Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a contract for defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport policemen in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they had observed it as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver ignored the holding signals and continued on the Burgess Road before turning into the Bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person matching the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of disregarding a holding signal as well as carelessly driving.
He is to appear in the court of office in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged for hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in Scotland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Looking back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice-president of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee empowerment law with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labour law law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember that this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions took part in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of the workers are guaranteed to union and joint bargaining and action."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements restricting this right or aimed at reducing it are null and void; measures aimed at this are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions for the protection of his interests."
For generations Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how civil and democratic societies could be formed, Americans declared that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then be protected as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights were under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal again, as a result of which the working population must have the right to unite and to listen to themselves in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - has long been overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made up in the past and triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which the attorneys say would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is to enter into force on 1 Sept. 1 would force doctors who carry out abortions, force them to take a patient's right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to acquire their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors may continue to carry out temporary legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with law while seeking to gain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the judge shall be held in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
In support of abortion, the decision welcomed the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors took so much more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing from a reserved law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the State's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and also applied for the right to make a decision.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Expulsion promoters and American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Expulsion opponents oppose measures to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patient-in-law rights, the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation for fear of safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their requests for patient's rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video home for her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians in which ovarian cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing prediseases, as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why women living outside the city died with higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to address distances, they proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of inflamed doctors to enable specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling home owners
The decline along with an increased sink in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds per year when today’s young consumers reach the "Cern age group for garden products" after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The rise of people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting for park purposes, and the declining garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion annually are implemented in sale.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that homes for rent or small gardens do not mean that humans cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor for the RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them during a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to increasing household numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the improved weather conditions under unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadi, continues.
In the capital city of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state TV station.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the Protestants out of PTV buildings again.
The station set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends back again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refuses to do so.
The army of the country is now calling for a political solution to the conflict, "no time wasting and using it without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan suggested Prime Minister Sharif to have cheated at the parliamentary election last May.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadi had called their followers to move to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey appointed U.S. diplomat due to spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has filed the country's most senior U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had Germany's most important intelligence service in the visor, caused significantly more enraged reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for Pendler
The national warning strike of the Lokführer on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
As regards all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport, announced at 6 p.m. on 18 to 21 p.m.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Photo: A. Burgi/Archive
said the district president of the German Locomotive Leader (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect considerable failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do anything to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to stretch, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and staff in Calvià City to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the police of Calvià on Mallorca's holiday island was arrested after accusations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and staff from the City of Calvià on Friday to the public prosecutor's office for the fight against corruption.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption accusations and were questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the authorities' veterans' economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about earning money anymore, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basis of life out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a Sauptour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants on the infamous alcohol-drinking pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced for one year to close while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents affecting alcohol, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has provided a winter surprise to Southern Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down to Sunday at night.
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a caste that began shortly before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had provided for an early spring dose last week, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The above weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a wind wind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
At this time, wind peaks reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start through on a second landing flight and finally set up around 20.40.
The delay in flight resulted in a delay in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Maximum time to connect
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech button centres, our columnist Bernd Mathies comforts himself with a highly familiar electronic accessory.
While I write this here, my view falls onto the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Booh, how retro is that?
But there is a reflection behind it: If the cable wasn't, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, is it true that the eclectic (Ekeltronics?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow, purchased - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, who simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the insistence of the Ifa on the radio tower again this week shows us our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who blindly controlled previously washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incomprehensibly empty expert address: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should one talk about with people who, apparently, voluntarily spread such Quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, we have been talking about networking our house.
So that the yogurt can re-order itself so that the fire detector tells us on vacation on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office to air conditioning on our early arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our watch, tell her out loud "sows!" - and at home the vacuum robot drives off.
It's crazy.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are swimming", a industry expert laments, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam generator sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but that doesn't make sense because we're in storage.
We also know from everyday practice: When a new-mode device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the telephone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas close to the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending summer in air protection areas, while rocket and mortar fires went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rockets in the south of Israel, but the signs of the struggles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and there's English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little weird" to go to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenades, still hesitates to return.
The Ministry of Education informed us that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily drawn by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you work knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the struggle; however, important problems remain unsolved, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the ports of Gaza.
Israel calls for a disarming of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated to be Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputed these information and estimated that it was at least half of the soldiers killed, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue to fight, last week the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school is soon open again so that we can continue to learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD banning procedures
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has expressed himself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD banning process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts down worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Landeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig Volkszeitung".
This is a good development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not in front of the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed in voting on Sunday at the five percent stake.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing extremity party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had informants in the NPD at that time.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at the Neuländer Platz.
The headquarters's initial reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting out of all the seams.
Now the internal authority has had three tents of the Red Cross set up.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little excited.
"These Hauruck actions continue to spare citizens' reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the human shelter of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party calls for Harburg’s district administration to make unused houses available for accommodation at the moment.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial take-up are the upswing of those seeking assistance - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a well observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Home Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a dual market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they increased by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hard hit by cuts in government spending and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that with the beginning of the spring, an increase in the real estate for sale would now be observed for the next months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistent low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements from the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to this to pose "like a warden".
This is not the style of the university, it is stated in the communication.
The Medau family had already been informed "in the middle of June orally about the arrival of the university.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preliminary or even decisions", but they would be "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
Of a nine-metre-wide road was and is not the speech.
According to the current stand, it's about 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schooly parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Train park is not at all because this, like other public parking spaces, can now be intelligently solved.
Think of the locals
The children's club Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and would lead the access to the parking deck before their doorstep, is said to be "not damaged" according to the president of the university.
Rather, he has to consider "that this is not just about the children's crèche, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is much more than about the particular interests of the men of Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the critique of the parents' advisory board of the children's cup, with the expansion of the road would be entitled to "lost the few natural spots of Coburg," "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils of the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of new development".
Last week, Peer Medau had informed the children's staff about the plans of the university.
Hence, the access to the new parking deck should not, as before, lead via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the Medau mountain.
This would require two-track extension of narrow road over about one kilometer of length.
According to the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
Of about 2,000 vehicles a day, the speech is available.
From the city side one did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old by the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly raised health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision, it's matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the World Champion of 2007 announced on his Facebook page.
He is therefore in the international retirement position with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful backroom player wants to go for a few years for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announces his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as well as they will inspire my long-standing co-players and my successors.
But I would like to be well available for my club in the next few years, for this there is a need for longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had to fear his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achillessen's problems, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball League (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Glandorf had then announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career don't pass any body without trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
These include some other wear related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I was controlling my head, my body could not deceive," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine Handball Time.
For a comeback he would only be ready in absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes rip, I am always ready to talk," the double family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years when I can still play handball by one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have become quite humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go straight at least.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he and Flensburg secured the European Cup of Cup champions.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises surrounding the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
The economy experienced consumption alone in spring, while investments decreased.
The economy also slowed down external trade.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP surplus of 0.8 percent is generated in the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietszen driver" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through Münsterland with their registration.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to participate in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Vereinsheim der Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where also the start took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was written for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were beaten on the way in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing was delighted with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for everyone involved.
The organization was without problems and there were no negative incidents," says Heinz Lölfing, a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We'll see ourselves again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers effortlessly honest memories
It is actually more philosophical evidence than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pacifist, Politsicher Activist, Ex-Häftling, has brought to paper in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fets for thought fets, the Munich, born on 1 June 1947, has written his memoirs, started each chapter by a matching songtext.
And he is unscrupulous: from Onanie to Gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness out.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also incorporate abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all this he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how not only music influenced him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician) but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk who is "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-spiritual views: for example, through beatings in a GI's frequented locality or a crazy driveway, in which he foresaw a tree in frontally.
Even there he's carelessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Listen with the collar.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinths with flame blasts and smoke and plenty of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then he was slowly heard how he began singing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without a witness of love from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad toward the end of her life did we begin to say "I love you, I love you, I love you".
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop this "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still married to French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strenuous.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's change of career may appear in his elegant short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies who have filled out his busy working life.
He started working in a factory at only 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I not only had to grow up in front of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which the people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I'm not sorry I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures who ridiculed and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedyserie Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and movie roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time around or taking a little step on it."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was just allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought him mostly for a domain of middle class, white in tights and a coal head in front.
So I was scared of that.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't worry if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words into your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare that way.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Otello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on me.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You need to bridge the computer for 10 minutes."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off stage and something inside said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This also came to be good, so it is like a great shield of the gods that tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNING voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a median - our conversation has gone through with humorous outbreaks, while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you'll drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo if I like it, but in total I don't have as much as I used to.
I wonder if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I'd ever want to give up that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis has called for civilian disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi trailers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic disaster in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the sheet, Huthi threatened further escalation of the conflict, his claims should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-controlled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi peoples have besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of Sala.
In the surrounding country, bloody fighting with the Yemeni army is repeated.
Kenya registers officials to control "spiritual workers"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to delete "spiritual workers" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($70,000) per month were lost in payments for "spiritual workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Yanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, has been reported in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "spiritual workers" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach was first negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand EUR 19.4 million compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That's what a lawyer told me on Monday.
In the application, it says that Achenbach cheated on buying works of art and oldtimern and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of which he was a headmaster.
From that time on Manfred Richter knows many established Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his desire to see the people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teaching profession after four years.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were exonerated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how Richter moved to the Upper Franconian Cenendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres a week to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, go to school three kilometres across the city and back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleeping accommodation in a red-cream home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he made the first, and in 1954, after three years, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching post for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service" apartment in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
Since 1968/69, these have been summarized in Petershausen in the town hall today.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 were able to obtain today's building, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor Ludwig Götz, who had also built a workshop at municipal costs and at the extension of 1997 cellars, although this was not eligible according to the school building guidelines.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," said Richter gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a question of justice and justice from a school council: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two kinds: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work." Whether he's just talking about his students or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they did not receive punishment from him, nor were they sunk to the afterseat.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves bought and had the two opponents attack each other, even if there was a auction.
For the good of the school, judges used a good relationship with the mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) at that time.
It moved the non-participating judge after his retirement to run for the local council in 1996 at least as the last one on the CSU list.
But Judge was elected to seat six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists insert in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scottish stopovers
If cyclists do rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of rasdens alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and accompanimenttross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Gradling and Celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and lived there a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which took 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started the bicycle in Bad Vilbel and the director of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schweng-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apples, blacks, spreads and cheese cakes, which were wonderful to the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake land women," one participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the drinking stand of the Gypsy Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, finally he has already re-mounted bicycle chains today."
The mayor and the operating director had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the reporter Rainer Janke's drinking house and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Doctoral director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004, was only able to get away for a short while, but he had plenty to do with the technique on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle station of the Hessen Police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice fixed atmosphere and, of course, had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his role as Executive Board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three showed clearly joy over the "many operations in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open sky was used diligently despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, more and more citizens, as did the good mood of the cyclists.
On the second day, the Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb stations - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the agenda for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", report local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the prisoners are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Härriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they supposedly founded an organized criminal union and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by Islamic clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he announced waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere above Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastekthow, head of school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive education that will be useful to them in their further lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud fame of the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when the top position of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Her settlement is said to have been nearly $1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence is twofold: inwardly on the first guard of your own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things are going wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But what newly arrived chairman would risk taking up all of this and taking apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, perhaps taking his own job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC belittled - power, money and status obsolete.
While competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collaterals, the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC increases again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: Today I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a notable chairman - I hope she's found him.
Perry from Texas says that depressing Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a depressing comment on the democratic district attorney, who was at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's user account, which was rejected by the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Employees of Perry did not reply immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable picture of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to a tax for drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to withdraw, which led to a charge against Perry - which might be presidential candidate 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweet reads: "I don't always drink with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he expands it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal counsellors requested the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in Texas's history is, unconstitutionally, diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - based in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to step back.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth in 2012 during his presidential candidate in Iowa, Perry agreed to stop speculation by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England was "returned to normal levels".
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of enormous price increases, which, due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble, the Bank of England was moved to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the top-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offered a "stable business environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the Katasteramt, prices in the city area have risen by 18.5 percent only last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers rose by about one-fifth last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "welfare tax" before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tighter lending schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the mortgage permit in July, which also suggests that the real estate market cools.
Hamps International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to down to 3 percent, based on a weakening home price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined around a quarter a year, according to Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for appointment sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the time sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million each year, turnover by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Company's Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be expected to correspond to current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nacktphotos of Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and sued the hacker for "explained privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozen female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iC Early" and "Victorious", however, disagrees that the photos are about pictures of her and tweet "These so-called nudist pictures of me are FEELING, folks.
Let's take care of the beginnings. *Wortspiel intends*.
On late Sunday, Buzzfeed reported that a speaker from the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the supposed photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved up like a cardboard box that you left standing in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, dissociated and perhaps a little scratched.
Then shake his hand.
He knew scratchy.
He was stingy, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for the relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shimmeringly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompaniment, which Kevern thought for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradisiac valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms there were spiders, nods had left their mark on all windows and believed they heard all this, and the garden was oversized with weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both threatening and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
With ailins, Kevern had sat on the broken sun loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had gone away to the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had enjoyed listening to with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their ancient aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly banned - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescenced, just as the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never done, and how the people chose from the platewashers to the millionaires, cookbooks and romantics in books, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing large feet in a grove-communic Serenade Ailinn's feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without placing two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny either.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where they would end up.
Just like the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had grown 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group allocation - gratefully as those who avoided fate.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage, which was left by the Greeks, broke plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country when it was PROTECTED WAR, who had been killed for fear of being accused of being ardent, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, held their minds and were depressed with the inaction.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be put to the fore.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook faithless her head and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her ungainly black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they say without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you made it to me.
She seemed honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse about that.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble, because like his father, he did not have the calming charm that one needed to look at the ferocity inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern, that's it.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her chair, threw the console over and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblossom, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm yolks in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She was sorry for him, both the unnecessarily unkindness of his words and the fear shown in her eyes when she turned up against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more despicable after DEM WAS PROTECTED WAR when it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't care!
They first cracked - gnats were the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unsavory love ballads from the console - they first crack and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refining, as the bruising itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt a cry, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him get away - just as her companion on a room on the upper floor saw him with it - a man who complained about something he had sworn up himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back bowed, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember one time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the incidents just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, worked at a brief lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely, in view of the funds and energy invested in the extermination of this violence.
"A lot has been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people, that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt historically despite the high-exquisite church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities are inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion he continues to awaken.
The people are crying in listening sentimental ballads, intoxicating themselves with stories about overcome difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former roughness hold rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and reserved dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nutsbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme again called for their right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feministin?
Shut up.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudicial job.
We serve a non-prejudicial society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in itself, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "abstainable" and "raw", could be interpreted equally well by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue on the road, if you're going to be able to do something about it, you're going to be like if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flaminorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree to, apologize.
Speak is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand where you want to go," said Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effective as we are preparing ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves able to repeat the mistakes that were caused only to DEM WAS BREAKING.
This time, however, it is not the others we let out of our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English age.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about the fact that they would have left out their "will" and their "trust" to "others".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when understanding the past as protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From that, when we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to say, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt needs to be allocated, no debt must be eliminated, if such a eradication would be appropriate and if there was a way of rescuing it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can say something about this,
Luther Rabinowitz gathered his pyramids.
"I will remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorbike driver who, as passersby described, was on foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup for the overthrow of the government and said that they were faced with police officers who were accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of attack.
Military spokesperson Major Ntle Ntoi said that there is no de facto coupe, but that the military is responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose weaponry was in the police.
"What happened this morning was that Lesotho's staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government in itself by force, all reports agree that Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of Lesotho's military informed on Sunday that the soldiers were delaying themselves in their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the vice-president Mothethjoya Metsing takes over the governance during Thabanes' absence.
Thabane announced that he believed that he had become the target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to conflicts in his united government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, otherwise speaking accusations to spite.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13 month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, including a well observed study.
The final Markit purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be taken before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a reluctance of the euro area and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that during the week, the ECB’s head Mario Draghi could provide further information on whether it is considering a quantitative facilitation for the euro area, in line with those made by the UK and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the Block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worry child, as is the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager's index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are currently finding life quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - especially, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The year of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in horror.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into horror, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the time of the horror.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will forever persecute them.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now going to find an end - and in the children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in an attempt to climb back to the busted school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the bustling school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were held dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida back then.
My legs were blood-flowing.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said, "three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knees.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says in a camp.
"That happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future fellow classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, even though the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo from me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hook, in the belief that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (runs go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearfully, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying child, took it by the hand, and fled through a ball hook.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in the arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had fallen outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, on her own, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow up in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the yard and who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London, especially the toy shop where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just like children like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and this is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light up candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turned his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, larger than me, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flowing face was marked by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, had taken him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the farm for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one's ever gonna forget that. I promise you that.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school so much that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People constantly investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I completed school this year and went to a medical school in Wladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but couldn't do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, the medical staff, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and they should not, of course, suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'll go to the celebrations for commemoration.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept this if something is so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knees.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't do a sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also about widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so badly worn by a special insert command in safety
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the horrors at all.
The world was breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at the time three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mob.
Her father Ruslan has been remarried since then and has with his new wife Svetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up on the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on a pedestrian crossing in Fife because of the passing of a three-year-old girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, took the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the process for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to make photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both worth $300.
I recorded these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are closed close.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes to optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to see which depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the correct picture setting is a matter of luck.
So you're taking a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that makes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make photos in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you have to approach your objects more closely if they are to fill out the entire frame of the image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character things changed, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to the diagnosis and disease, while the patients are mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
"I'd rather want everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray investigation of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer attacking the breast skin, which is the skin that overwhelms the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers earlier.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered a "wonder substance" but has now been recognized as a deadly one.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, than the industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumber, construction workers, room workers and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, he seems hardly to be alarming today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, is experiencing the climax of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths from Mesothelioma here than any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the fatal effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a Mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a safeguard room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos-resistant.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been made up as a source.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a damper either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if there were a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I had completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been ill with Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to live."
How many of us will still be ill?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still suffer?"
The leading expert in the United Kingdom on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to rise, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea that they will die this way.

A brief look at the documents of the courts to which the parties concerned frequently refer for claims for damages shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioma has already been spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her job with M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the twins.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesothelioma, I haven't even really known anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but rather to a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, tube insulations, boile insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death rates.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomarates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London,
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesothelioma sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "an important proportion of mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be sparked by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Parliamentary members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the direction of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion must be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and after the general elections in 2015, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never precisely determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was performing an operation late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had Shütlfrost.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the drive home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chest skin that touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors took X-rays from his chest and put Pleurakathether on to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not relate to his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Frankly, I didn't worry so much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year's week: "It was told me that it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesothelioma meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with ash-steolations in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who went from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that more than several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbeste was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have turned their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And so innocent objects in our houses, such as flooring plates or drapes, have included asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in much of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out how to tear your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perceptive change from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to handle.
"It was very difficult to accept all this," he said.
"I asked my doctor "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our survival mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of Mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is strangled and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled umbilical asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax agent who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos, is ironically a leading center in the treatment of Mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from breathing to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with Mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure defys that.
"You can't cut the chest fur out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
At that time, the cancer "does not speak very well about chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for the affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he said in a happy time on phone calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and his life would only be extended by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred to, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to perform the best available therapies.
But when these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many people are concerned by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that there was also a very low risk of health.
And here the carelessness of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally joined their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma patients who seek compensation, a huge problem to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the knockers.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation which makes it easier for mesothelioma affected to sue compensation even if their former employers are no longer present.
The law has established a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can demonstrate a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the prosecutors receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal damages process could have addressed them - approximately $120,000.
Some 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks that as many mesothelioma affected them, £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, pointing out that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone over it and Mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in view of seven deaths, quick action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma law in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expected to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, with the most important," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that's gonna make you move on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's life-consuming.
Abbott re-entered six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumours is visible.
But the process is physical and psychologically very strenuous.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I'm not anymore, for example, or my wife shows how the Boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16 and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They responded quite differently.
Tamsin is very social and unscathed.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelismarkts, such conversations have not gone through with hope, not with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a gruesome security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections, the Chinese Parliament decided by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led planning and mobilization to it within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress in principle allows Communist leaders to reject all non-performing candidates.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to have its inhabitants elected as of 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right of election for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership remains firmly in hand through a closely controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love for the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-effective protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to give up the financial district if Beijing does not allow a true universal right of vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central trailers had gathered in the rain before the main government quarter in Hong Kong within a few hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning to plant protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as the last means, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing announcement for days, and security measures including police and barricades were taken on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
Incentives from the mainland increase competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it endangers business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the Hong Kong democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights involving 78,000 people - more than a fifth of the Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen appearances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service of the UK for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also indicated that the service had a security savings.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
A business speaker said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being removed.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month face a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the very rising bills for the simplest living bases before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival at the student residence.
Females Criticise Racial Question and Police Behaviour According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9 the personal essays came with titles such as "thinking of Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt impelled to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day but are not considered as "woman themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colorful ones are under siege in their own land, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleanly separating the topics; they live in combined reality every day.
While women now link the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were suffering, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story in order to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white combatants for women's election rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for electoral rights could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply for women's election rights, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade to organize white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the initial request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to reception control?" said Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built up their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptional means now try to understand what this means.
The famous Feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, asking for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for an intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on racial themes in America are still astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson contrast their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently laid down a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police have picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a re-thinking of the topic as an essential women's theme she should simply publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a recess in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweden House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for $120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig that his head had embedded on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connells said the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was, however, misplaced and has been removed," said one of the company's spokespersons.
In the exhibit of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom house."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest to the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City Harvey is home to a new millionaire according to Lotto win
A Harvey lottery player is coming this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth will take place with a lucky winner who will receive almost $1.1 million from lottery education on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still has to report.
Steve Forward, the store owner, said that the profit is for conversation in the small town in the south-west of Perth.
The city is not talking about anything else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, an adequate degree for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiatoresarena
Not only the gladiators stood snookeltief in the Matsch at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the Freizeitpark.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who were able to withstand the rain showers and the autumn cold and let themselves be unrestrained by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martial battleship of the Gladiatorian School of "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and competent presenter and then sent his men into the ring to the heroic twosome struggle in various gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangle shield and short weight as well as leg rails on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short weight and sausage as well as iron gladiatorial helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which came against the "Secutor" with the cast net, the drier and the dolch and, after a short struggle, hit the bush to the ground.
As the swords joined in metallically, the shields were being created, and the blazes flowed surringly through the arena, that fear and anxiety could become the health of gladiators.
But to that the impressive Summa Rudis, the musculous arbitrator, had an ever-increasing eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era possible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis Romankanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum" was created from the theme park for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, not only have the Romans brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be marveled at during the Romans' Day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which was once standing at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once opposed water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms diploma survey engineer Ralph Heiligener from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as chorobate, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive, too, the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs in the steps of sound two millenniums ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
They found walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and for grinding.
The building had probably belonged to a Villa Rusta, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or as once the Roman students wrote their names on wax panels with metal handles.
At the stand of the Romans Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bastle at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken and at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a loft or a muesli.
With the original remodeling of two coldflowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachberg will also be brought into the Rhineland-wide proclaimed Romans Year 2014, which is to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remember the Roman past of Wachberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the next watchtower, plants presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and offered a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of watchtowers "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, often but not at first glance visible traces of the Romans in Wachberg are to be made available again.
In the town hall of Wachberger, a small presentation of the discovery of the Berkum Matronen sanctuary in 1879 will be remembered.
Ebola: The Epidemic Detains West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest is rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely increased the region.
Some international companies are already on a distance as well.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is most severely affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
All in all, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies throughout the resource-rich countries are expanding their business.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their home to get reintroduction.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting on the fields.
Farmers do not dare leave their homes for harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables remains at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently to feel: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the supply of basic food such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the heavily dependent region threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is important how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may feel that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also strains the state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the countries concerned which are already stressed.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be greatly stressed by the high expenditures for the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also apparent in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Schütten celebrates her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year founding festival run from 12 to 14 September.
It is scheduled on Friday, 12 September, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., the big bullies shoot.
The "Stoopfälzer Spitzbuam" is the final stage of the evening of moods in the large citadel.
Blakapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great feast at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and gaug shoots.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdams with their dirndls.
==References====External links==
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker took over the partnership.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by exercise in the room-handling and small calibre shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the association to disband in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again who raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism on April 30th.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult start-up period, in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting plant.
The Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the Rundenwetfläge in the fall of 1965.
In the following years, the sportsmen, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The club records purpled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club's "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors led by Johann Rinn decided to create a future domizil in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
On 8 May 1988, after a work of 2700 hours, Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th gau shoot, combined with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the association as a whole was the alignment of the Bavarian Böllerconference 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, last year the club members modernised the rooms and the shooting facilities at the Berngau Hof and thus brought them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in Rundenwetwettweet
The sporting services of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstechen, carnival and king's ball, club trip and Christmas celebration have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and church.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tires were set in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-person team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnny.
We're going to Richmond and hoping we can do better there.
Stewart previously drove to a wall at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I entered today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnny, adding, "it just didn't fold."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tugs and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver at an ash race in the north of the state of New York and killed him.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of Kevin Ward Jr. 20-year-old, who had entered the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the studies on the cause of the accident would last for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will have to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had just moved to the first 10 and was temporarily on fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Cars with no. 18 out of control after the exit of curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both wagons riding against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Tanzfreudiger Jugendsuche
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head of Lisa Nietzel (from the left) look forward to contestants.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also make the whole day class at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have highly decimated themselves.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Nietzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to fifteen-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more activities, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, between 17 and 6 p.m. on Thursdays or on Fridays between 17 and 18.30 p.m.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore via classical music up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of socialism either.
"We're going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've already stayed in the dance room," Lisa Nietzel reports.
In the group one can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not the same, it can also sniff into one of the other offers of TV jahn.
Children and adolescents can always sniff into the lessons in children's dance/jazz dance, bambini-ballett, video-clip dancing and hip-hop on Wednesdays.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Who likes discofox, long-lasting whales, Vienna's Walzers, Rumba, Cha-Cha and Tango, may pass by and participate.
Bulgarian Prisoners Protest Nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Justice Ministry in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for one month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meeting between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures informed the BNR, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army Quit Airport of Luhansk
In the Ostituutraine, the prorussian fighters are on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which supposedly also involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the Luhansk Rebellenhochburg.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn human consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian Separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have, according to their own representation, shot another fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in battles in Donetsk region, according to the insurgents, on Monday Russian agencies.
Coast Guard Ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have for the first time sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Asow Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been attacked on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages under their control in Donetsk.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group meets today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from the Ostitzraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their claims.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was following the founding agreement of the NATO Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a scratched break" of the agreement.
"Today, we have to look at reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "they see us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced the desire to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still being taken to ensure that they also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine no longer receives fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Power word: Tout will come "all clear"
Now the chancellor clearly acknowledges this.
A newsletter for all complicated details, but it is not.
Durable concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll have engulfed the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has, after continuing resistance from her CDU, spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"In order to say it quite clearly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU summit bodies in Berlin.
But at first, Merkel did not decide on a detailed model.
In the black and red government programme, "determined parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "has made a proposal, and it is now being worked on."
The NRW CDU, however, insists on its no. to a toll right on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) had been constructively involved in the deliberations for a draft law.
Beyond the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it" Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report on Sunday, his house is checking its own concept to pay for motorway investors with tolls - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the Cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty never expected to affect all the district and federal roads," said the President of the CDU, North Rhine-Westphalian CDU.
So it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landesverbands Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background are fears that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty due to the toll criticism of the CDU series.
The Left considers the plans to fail in view of the dispute in the Union.
"Murks-Maut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the toll the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignet obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be subject to any additional burden.
They are therefore to receive full compensation for tolls via the car tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not prejudice foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
A Britishman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis, she would die for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she only had a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness, an unsafe corridor and curved toes.
Sickness also suffers from feeling deaf or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is 51 years old today said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride rollershoe or skateboard with the other children and was often held in school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her health records at the time her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA in response to several operations to discharge her Achilless son and stretch her feet.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the illness in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and gradually all my skills would be lost.
I made all of this out with me alone and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not been as low as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness-month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former military training site as a fireworksman.
For nearly ten years, the former military training site in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, every month, the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb is still killing ammunition.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be split locally.
A deafening bang stops during explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on business in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country slightly increased last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the Washington companies were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company's government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest income from companies at 28 percent.
A large proportion of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery in company real estate values, say the researchers, which resulted in an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also appears to be in the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to offer the same services offered by other countries.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government organisations of $3.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local tax burden for businesses does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3% of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has with 6 percent in all three areas of employment the significantly lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3 percent.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be getting better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Company taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than the total corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Government's spending cuts had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malts - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - so is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vice-Secretary of the South Chinese Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the Chinese ruling Communist Party functioned again and again to this concern of the Twelve Millions Metropole.
Guangzhou, also called canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, threw Li.
So people also owned the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't take much: good water, grain and pleasure in life," he added at lunch with the party chief in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already sparked Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou joined Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed after the German purity bid.
More business
A second wish from the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Chairman Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician was convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travellers had to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, lamented Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight.
Chen Yunxian, Vice Governor of the Province, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded.
Right-wing partnership
The lazy vice-member of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year at a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption accusations.
The local chief of the party, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a national campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced by head of state Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining the city of Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometres away Guangzhou is one of those that are cared for by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis at the Perlflus is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Joan Rivers family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but today her daughter has been hoping that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your continuing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a communication today.
We all push the thumbs.
Her mother was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency at a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors are deliberately sedated and observed until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sites, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are currently on the market.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st to show the buyer at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
There is also more money for the scaffold builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion thing decided, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", so an insider.
The Tswitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which betterwisser gives the (most older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat boring, a textbook example of an established technology company buying up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company reportedly was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know about at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that goes out to watch others while playing instead of even taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to look over the shoulder to a friend at 3 a.m., while she's sniffing through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spider be shot 20 times in Call of Dust.
All these games, you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the eye view can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which Roger Bannister's entire electronics age finish all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humorvirtuosis, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertising clients.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, yet not even - swallow - as spectators.
There was a lot of going on at the Hoppfburg Castle at the Burggartenfest on the Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainstorm on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in Burggarten.
The entry had to be stopped at a time.
"That was annoyed," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sakhaj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to shine brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was demonstrated already on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors to the Open Air got up.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And this has been done to them.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese it had made salt weatherers, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, swung with the foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were announced.
And that's through the generations.
While the one on blankets on the extra-carved white sands at the beach bar llumbled, others fell on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the young people died at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when the children's mingling was done, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all their hands full to become the andy master and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot crew made of saltweed.
Until the rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he was blaming down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not do so.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday compared to the popular voice.
He was annoyed by the fact that in the meantime the entry had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the grounds.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were strolling in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off her appearance.
The technicians were unable to create half a reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltweedel due to a tire pan.
"But next year they will be there," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And this in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that are still to be forgotten during the first time, but must be eliminated during the second edition.
The organizers also need to be critical of the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately you have taken a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it is very good that some not only talk stupid but also really try to put something on the legs.
Hat off!", Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organizer remains a year to put these criticisms at the disposal of the organizers.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not expected to be the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the installation of the TIRA space observation radar, the case, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to change the cap
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is put on.
If the weather happens, the action should be taken at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice Bucket Challenge runs out of pine
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully beyond.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go, the jaw was embroidered, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw that too and almost got into the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was sent to the hospital to let the jaw re-enter after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgvereins soon to pull back on a stretch?
Finally, there was always a twilight between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereins.
Now the Boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project to the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Wolfratshausen Burgfreunden.
So far the views of Wolfratshauser Burg seemed different, how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction.
The two camps are now moving together: talks are to be held soon about a joint action.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could in future pull back into one line.
This is how faster visible successes are to be seen.
While the Burgfreunde had in mind the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the last reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, the "Development and Experience" of the site is at the forefront of the Sjöberg Burgverein.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very happy about the call, according to his own details.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the burger friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially left the club activities out of respect."This "thinking phase" would have been necessary to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also take a current view of the mood within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to continue working on the project "but very much".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far-reaching projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
By high participation of the population as well as voluntary volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I became more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward. It could be created a "one-stop mark" for the Flüßerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to just throw over board the idea of reconstruction," he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving a little on this point.
Their aim to document the story at first is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save on university teaching books
Since the cost of university teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-twissedest student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chickfil-A-Keks," Schroeder, 19 said, visiting the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management informed that the students averaged more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and study material, but that there were different cost damping options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university books, announced that renting text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented last spring, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus stores according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one thing for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the prize for which they are available on campus bookstores online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended that students ask their professors whether previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates to the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them quite well, remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself of the provisions of the business at which you rent, including the penalty fees which may apply to the writing of notes, impressions or traces of use.
Renter Note: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics today can be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Take a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering an online order, you should check out if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks' delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't get a checkout
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollar budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" cut on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like "Drachenzähmen Easily Made 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collins indicates that the lack of quality in films could be the reason for the child's films themselves.
Collins described in 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzähmen eicht 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year on at least 2000 canvases.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and point out that this year's film hit is equivalent to that of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times change."
We have to accept this and not try to follow up on the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash flow of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and prophesing a "core melt" Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashiers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema casino at all, and no one will worry about the business."
When a few years ago the 2nd category of table tennis was removed for streamlining the lignite classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: whoever has not ascended has gone down.
For example, Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has prevented the descent, but plays only five in the coming season.
Four-class torpedos women remain, despite their grand march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserve will take place in the new League League League, in which the Landesliga are no longer represented by Göttingen Clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the banding league, the Torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superliga south.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league, Dransfeld and the SC Weende are represented as regional representatives, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district top league of the ladies begins at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen run into the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW boys - there is still torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen circuits start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East season, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The women's kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at all.
Recognising that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieve solstice, this is where the innovative and ambitious circuit board will have to think.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-throwing summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following for us the weekend and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenager out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bushgoers were brought to safety with the rope winds after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govet's Leap in Blackheath to their tour.
Cared relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search bar from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt his knees and the man had crashed and had his head set up.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Escalating anti-governmental protests in Pakistan
The 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After just half an hour, the transmitter resumed its radiation.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with poles had damaged devices in the editorial board.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the chief of government to whom they are blaming electoral fraud.
The police informed that about one kilometer from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had met again on Monday with some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed during the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using violence".
The Communication also stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for the military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadi have taken place since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to step down.
Khan and Qadi had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to step down," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan claims Sharif to have won the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially peacefully endured before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to move to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
After the second season, Hütteldorfer won the third place of the table.
With the 2–0 over Grödig a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end to Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the exit in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was very important," confirmed Captain and Torschütte Steffen Hofmann, who with green-and-white came to third place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the correct reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season and goes with a success experience into the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley from the Sixteentheck in the 14th minute, has set the course on victory.
"I thought I'd get all the frustration from Thursday and snuck him under the latte," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel last met a federal league on November 13, 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory to him.
"For me, that's something special, I'm from the Rapid New Year's Eve," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term Becken Blessur, Schrammel pushed from the left to the right defensive side and also made his case very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirror wrong.
The goal he earned is that he has already done a few assists this year," said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann after well an hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that the guests could have written down.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Schrammel, who's been referring to the splitting up of performance and results in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before" one had been better than today - against "the strongest team that played in this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 proved, therefore, that the team structure was still intact with the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less enjoyable for him: "That we finally played too zero again."
A lot of work during the national game break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures have to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Berendt and Pavelis players, "who were very stable lately."
The country game break therefore had to be used in order to " lick wounds and to make a little bit of it in the physical sphere," Barisic, who has five U21 electorate in his ranks.
One to which the break is probably especially located is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team, going over pain.
He has shown that he is a very important player for us, especially in this difficult phase," Barisic noted.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids before its change in the 68th minute but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 about the admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably also had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He, of course, urged to continue to concentrate: "You can't always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad as it has been shown in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can really help right now.
They'll stick to me at some stages," Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the fast counter-measure "from the category of sorcerer", as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been recognized by referee colleague to injustice.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards gate in some phases.
We've had too few conclusions.
Immune defender Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It started equally badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
There would have been more in it.
Under this whirlwind, Ruh reigns
We showed a powerful tribe during our enigma of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the pictured specimen is the "geißruhe" above Unterweisenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes groups, basaltstone clusters and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, is there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it rises beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with an area of more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there was only evidence of the name’s origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Episcopal Archive and consulted older people from Unweßenbrunn in order to learn what context it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats were supposed to have driven their animals from sub-white brown to the tedden and rock-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guardians exhausted by the ascent should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows it is actually growing again goats.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixes.
A hiking trail leads from Underweisenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Other paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön climb up and invite to an extensive hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
A water castle, which is sought in our next task, is, however, rather rare to find at the altitude.
The mirroring in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings to which the building counterfei could fit.

After weeks of deafening, Italy's Prime Minister and President of the EU Matteo Renzi, has won the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU's special summit last week, and she will succeed the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government-related daily La Repubblica reflects the appointment of its Mogherini, who is also a favourite of the government team, as strengthening the position of the social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to put the always-inspiring left-winged party base at ease, because Mogherini is assigned to it - although rather moderate.
Against conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish President-in-Office, Donald Tusk, said that the dominant opinion in Rome would make a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will be a deputy to Commission President Juncker at the same time.
The approval of the EU Parliament, which is still outstanding, is considered to be secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spread optimism that the Mogherini, known for their ambition, has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades, will show itself to be "standard challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with the PhD in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the 2001 election in the party council of left-wing democrats, she entered high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
Its traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known through studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a military contingent, and established contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The provisions in Brussels, which have too little diplomatic experience of the new EU external representative, are therefore lacking in substance, are co-occurred in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, we have the suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine and are defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the Italian energy security system.
After Renzi had joined the EU Presidency in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shakespeare's hand were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as that they invited the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is an Azubi, who has previously completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees are active in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Büssel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtachtach, Daniel Versorgfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfrimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages and the trainers go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a whole day hike and rafting are on the program.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet re-establishment has come upon disapproval by the great majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay at his side," he said with great applause.
As a captivating gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the regime of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the guise in which she appeared at a meeting of apostonized socialist MEPs and the Socialist Party criticised for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right-wing leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant grave struggles and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not have any, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived even a summer.
"And the new one will not survive either autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party for a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that in the case of elected elections, she would rise as a winner and would be ready to the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front lay ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival groups before the end of the term in Holland 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and recordless figures.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruiser in the world, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and in the next few years is expected to be in emerging economies such as China and India due to the strengthening of the middle class.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $ 850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruiser owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises stock market.
Per-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election.
A true peaching group swung near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peaching faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for oppositional democrats to be admitted for election and has prompted pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and to paralyse Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leadership fears that the call for democracy is expanding to other cities.
After the release of a Beijing White Paper in June of China's domination over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on electoral procedures in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Permanent Committee Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office and Macau of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of Hong Kong's office in the afternoon.
Great Britain had no democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kyiv to take up "Stately talks" with the Otitzraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government launches the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and begins directly with negotiations on the "stateliness" of the reverent region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government for negotiations at an early stage with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he has pursued since the outbreaks of five months ago: help for separatists to take up territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to provide actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state TV channel One condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glamorous time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope "to be caught in their illusions" during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups in the areas held by separatists attack on soon-to-be peace talks, Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start immediately extensive discussions, not only on technical questions, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in context with the greater autonomy discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to spread fears in Russian-speaking territories that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesperson to correct the "feelin interpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leading claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct annex of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in connecting the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the Ostituraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - consider additions to the Constitution allowing the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weaponization and incitement Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at eye level followed another advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered the Ostattraine via the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took the lead, which is, according to fears, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novosibirsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to fasten Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novosibirsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and called for urgent action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're just waiting for a point where there's no back again," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not adopt concrete actions that required leadership to draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the context of an untapped escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged Separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers imprisoned by the Russian invasion in Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutes captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naktphotoscandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Gemesten did not make a heel for his anger over hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker is responsible for this, probably has 60 nudist photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delivingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were supposedly also publicized private photos due to an iCloud leak.
On the list are 101 promis.
Dearest one who had engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential: "It's repulsive."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reports that a news website said that the hack was "painful" and that the people concerned felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two photographs in which she is located above without in a pool.
The film works Palmers include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but selling hehlerware."
Just in legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, Jogger and Wanderer were present yesterday at the 8th wheeling on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Cancerd Children".
The tour, for which one was a Tortur, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove the bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle casket, especially since the participation in the 8th cycle in the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for the Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can - fine!"
Little peacock on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early tau and came close to exhaustion but happily arrived on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cross the almost 11 km long line between Hohenmark and Feldberg.
Norman Dißner, for example.
The green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - made a bit of understatement at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there is arrival!"), but then he proved himself half professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing trouble.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had made his way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, as we are happy to be with it - we would have made an exit today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to stumble back to the altitude.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had moved to the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "make" the Feldberg two times, to roll home with fun.
"Fries-Toni" was also fun.
Cycling tours over the Feldberg are easy for the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk.
He had reached 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitized racing cyclist".
That's what he has to be, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad" road, but they're also racing bikes, but without circuit...
The fact that it went loosely up without a wheel not only proved the 20 hikers who rose up to the summit via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz but also a jogger who drew a car tire with weights behind a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who provided security with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh himself." So the man is his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
