Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is dug.
Small gardeners manage the former grounds of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories by day.
It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.
Anyone who had to get excited, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer from the Geoportal Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but that's precisely why very informative.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flickentepich, which is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called originals, have been incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Measurement Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and were the result of the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 finally withdrew: there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a covering Bayern card.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt für München dates back to 1856 and is like all others to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison Previous/Today is the most impressive example of the capital city.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was a municipality in Munich, Germany, 21 years after the creation of the map.
==References====External links==
The Untersendlings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, there is nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallways from the so-called "registration" from which the base tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer prove farmers there today - but small gardens of the "Land in Sun".
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the height "On the airs" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, you once locked in people with mad views.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Luften" was created.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called errors.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked on an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circumcision Centre in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrias.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training firms.
Westly lies the football court of TSV Munich East, east of the houses of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural connection to the original construction of the Irrhenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allies bombed many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained at the Marienhof until today.
The English Institute, small business houses and a cave chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking for the second S-Bahn tram line took place.
With the slider the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group Released Travel Warnings for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored Ones has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouriers to pay special attention when travelling through the State and to exercise extreme caution as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted here in the Group's opinion."
A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state to aim disproportionately at minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol left during the trip through the state and was carried into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, showing that black drivers in the state are held 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring security money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which took the state to 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Before that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States passed immigration laws, requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaunproject is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got an image on site.
At the Schwendemann family court, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his business, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as he does and houses in five apartments holiday guests.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternatively free marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementar important".
I cannot profit from such steep areas.
The greenland area provides for a lot of work, much has to be done with the motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical protection and fertilizers, even if he did not run a organic plant.
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leader support".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this could allow for a long time for the reforestation of the land.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced through the support of pasture fences.
The area of disclosure shall therefore be 40 hectares, which shall not be inflamed by at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded via Leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a good job, without farmers and country women you're not going."
For Peter Weiss also noted: "Best food is produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is the presence of a support course described by the LPR.
In addition, the depleted area must not be depleted (more than 35 per cent of the population) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels that want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way.
The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more holy?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the status of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.
But he seized their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.
When Miller Acosta yelled: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller is actually right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus' uproar words, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "eaching waste" on our screens could be seen better.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they carried out a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exilers.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing have long wanted to change this back.
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom does not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way into the United States."
Well, it's pretty unusual to see Limbaugh hit something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of perception.
The great fantasizing act of Lazarus consisted in seeing it as it was seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch shall not light up the way, but shall inflame the hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotss belonged to the UK team
Neil Black, the United Kingdom’s service director of athletics, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will "make a massive contribution to the team in the World Championships Framework".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "sich in Scotland has to learn something special" and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with that guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilith Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's red was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great."
The commonwealth silver medal winner, who will enter the 400-m-hundreds at their fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a medium-sized runner, has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that you should watch after a great season that included the victory with the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shot was in Team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "normally proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It shows only how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get up on Podien.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics About Facebook: Don’t throw yourself around a public office if you can’t tolerate the inheating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to its political principles.
He was in the critique, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the appeal as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and to make his hairless head debut after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially called and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chese defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whips online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Mrs., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent messages," she wrote in the comment field of the news "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea, either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack" would likely call others "pronunciation".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest demonstrators and to silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters followed his lead.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the UK won his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next door to Archerfield left to the final round before losing against Paul Eales last year, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he established this place.
He is a bitter champion of this game and proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 year career.
"This really feels special," said Southport-based player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on his home ground.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more if you play at home," Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went so far."
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £ 5 per car with one passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE) are presented in a study to this effect.
"Our estimates indicate that 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he initiated his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works on the Villinger Strasse are in full swing and "are in time", says the director of the Fred Heinze building yard.
In the area of home connections, the situation was more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much was hidden, which was not included in the plans.
The traffic, which always hinders construction work, poses a major problem for the Stumpp company's construction troops.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and lockout lattices is already huge," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty busy already.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potatoes - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coal-cooled tubular is taken and swallowed with a frigid, unwashed hand.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with heavy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagemen are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote for the occupation troops by a public hand survey.
An existing movement in favour of independence from the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which has control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated sheet roofs transformed by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a God called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her lively hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has degraded the value of US$3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We'll lose everything" is stated in a report by the Archdiocese Brisbane of 2016, in which reports of horrors of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
During his election in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Yokowi in Volksmund, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's initiation in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired in the group of the children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 young Papuans, women and children gathered in a football court in front of the local police station and the military commanding center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago strain.
Some demonstrators started to sling stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, a command was sent to the soldier via an internal radio: "If the masses are more than three times resistant, they shoot them dead," says TIMO's official document, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIMO on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man, Alfius You, was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who has only one name like many Indonesians, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The head inspector of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical maladies in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto retired when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been filed, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai offers accepted such claims with fierce infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, and I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction firm who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Dou, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I hid myself in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily held under the pretext of "assuring national sovereignty".
Some people never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat, especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-trained and more wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions on international media are still strained.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election struggle to remove the reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papa: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Minister Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4th, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom", according to a source that also took part in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Yokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "stupid" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of Trotism: the body of a victim was buried on an area exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that perhaps they will never get justice, but at least they will not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 79-storey buildings of 337 meters high.
It is the second fire that swept through the high-rise in just two years, which you accidentally call the Torch Tower (Fakkel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting by 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) erased the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the paneling, the exterior panel for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said that the system of plates to isolate and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed some 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continued Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has joined the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport, to play Davis Cup single only on two prizes, was not supported by the required two thirds majority.
The five-story classics, often very long, but also very appreciated for this reason, will thus remain in the tradition competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only barely missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our memberships have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the competitions.
Not even the vote had already come before the proposal to present the finale in a neutral place after many of the objections.
New details are only relatively smaller from 2018: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host rights in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings banned items into the aircraft, finds out a survey
A survey of passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously prohibited objects smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.
The most common objects that were deliberately thrown past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted to knowingly wearing objects with blades through safety control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidental smugglers had caused airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggler - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they are allowed to carry, or how much of it.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of the objects seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA could view books as smugglers.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Tens of Thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Elon Musk is happy to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far interrupted that part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-performing figures on sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk for the first time, when he announced the recent quarterly balance sheet, for the first time, has revealed another, less glamorous number: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently applied for the new car with more than 500,000 preorders over the past few months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla pays back the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment".
Currently 455,000 of such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders to date could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth goals is not demand but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 should - all models taken together - be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who today order a "Model 3" may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are longer delays, then the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in groups.
EPO CEO Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in the rules of Obama-Era to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved itself to be a response-fast administration to the needs of the state environmental authorities.
He did not mention the action that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeal court.
It is about a time limit for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental rules for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industry.
The sudden reverse of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanleks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turnaround at Ozone Standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"With previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then is waiting to be accused of activist groups and others and to set an agreement on the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have."
However, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt would at some point use its "permit for delay and all other legal powers available" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress press for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York general prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists rejoiced over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We need to continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to compete with environmental pollution and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 p.m. is invited to a Serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village small man."
In 1267, the St. Hilariukapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergic documentary book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the "mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a glorious courtyard, to which the church or the Patronate right belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the magnificent settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 support these historical events.
Patronate law came from early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a parish priest, continued to be the owners of this church and could also inherit this church of his own.
This was the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two bursts at Christmas 1673.
In 1692, the newly acquired bell was first created, but it was later to be released in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were hit and the bell sails were stolen.
The roof was light.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
In 1809, remains of the church threatened to fall.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
The cemetery was extended in 1823 and the Hilarius Church was canceled.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only today's tower had been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant by the "Beautiful pensioners".
As an organizer, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to St. Hilariukapelle on Sunday 16 July to the sixth Serenade.
This is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium's Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the concluding word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Let's get started at 3.30 p.m.
To the end of the Serenade there is a circle in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers present the fantastic view.
Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumlingen and oscillators.
Friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of windwheels checked
"Boisheim turns away" sees no legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wrt sich" asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in fours there was only a wind force concentration zone at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone produces an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent a "sparation" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"As a result of the lack of planning conditions, the approval decision granted is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim is back".
Current status of things: The City Council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the district of Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them to the point of re-examination.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to express itself on Thursday to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim turns out to be".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four windwheels per 200 metres high on an area on the Boisheim Nette.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of some 11 400 households is expected to be met - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained closed for hours.
According to police records, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich and her car accompanied by her 53-year-old mother accompanied the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are supposed to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into downtown shopping.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is designed to raise customers' awareness of what offers the city has to offer beyond the usual supermarket ware.
Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are expected to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to the "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action was not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation are commercials on radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the well festival, including open-ended Sundays, talks with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturdays and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to living the city centre - to the landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was appropriate to overcome the Lethargy with a network that partly spread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "home shopping" day, for the first time, takes part in five Thüringer cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was supposed to "encourage for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion of U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another injured man was in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A first missing person was also saved to death.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall after transscripts of telephone calls.
Transscripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nicho to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president blamed him for publicly accusing the wall. According to reports he said to him, "You cannot tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who migrated to Australia was "laughable", "my" and "thumm" and that the existence on the trade mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees into the USA.
Mr. Trump terminated the call after he had told Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists re-establish racist Lynchak as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and turned to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block his path.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
The inmates floated in there in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" the man roared.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Scream broke the silence when a young black man was torn by the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is only a follow-up.
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience were very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights leaders have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - suffered by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It is really inconceivable that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of delivery.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to persecute, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to salvation and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court doctor puts a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, citizens' rights say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia to give their voice for the first time at the pre-election campaign in summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI of black farmers Roger Malcom put down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the national and local prosecutions, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more pregnant.
"It was a right-wing massager," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch's murder.
Their representation is vivid, poignant and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynchen because we're then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - started in a room and laughed when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams and harasss him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still tickling.
"I just don't think white people said "a--he" back then."
"But," one of the other black actors whitewashed.
"You just have to meet the hard R.."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and shows Billie Holidays' mourning praise for "Srange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred metres behind it, a group of about four spectators get sweated and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the road.
They have experienced Georgia's heavy moisture for almost eight hours if Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdotes, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels splendour.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hang on their heads, register falsified blood and the quiet body and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks down in her arms crying together, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta gets excited about the reproduction with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "this is called police shooting today."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table, eats and remembers civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning the performance next year.
"The reproduction is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like that if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled "Distortion"
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful and frivolous production in front of a giant six-storey backdrop.
The rotary stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) has an optional street corner with its wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Ellaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, there is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer in which the Rheintöchters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which draws through its "ring" production.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as if in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood manner a body into the trunk and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderful bad hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal's the scene when he's beating Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eich) must also believe it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
The stormy celebration is Foster, Milling, Vinke and Conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in army leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors had been eagerly expected.
In 2013, he had to pass a valid pipe concert, and five years later there was a great jubilation in which the individual "Buh" ruptured.
Chief of the Festival Katharina Wagner may have enjoyed it.
"You can see that the audience grew up with the "ring" in some way," she said just before the performance of the dpa.
Not only had the audience made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown to understand its view.
I'm doing a positive resuscitation.
Max Quantum works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where are you everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've worked at school on an open day as well.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-class volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineer's degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, in focus maybe also, really.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably in the Youth Office Herne a social worker training and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not something unusual to have several different sites during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it's very variable.
It's always a matter of where to make your FSJ.
It can be done from the home of old age to youth - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that stimulated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
One always has other people form heads, each having a completely different story behind it.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any contact fears?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British Pearson education group said on Friday that it would reduce more than 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which had already lost 4,000 jobs, the job loss announced mainly by Director General John Fallon at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced in a third cost reduction program in May a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved a 1 per cent increase to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi Attack of Kabul: Nato Soldier Killed in Suicide Battle
A suicide offender attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, announced a statement by the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In an opinion from the Nato, the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosion rate carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since the US-led troops forced the Taliban of power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, the suicide-kills in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy and, in particular, the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO's decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of Obama’s government, which requires the States to control the smog-generating emissions, one day after 15 states sued the Agency for action.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to measure ozone regulations - in which pollutants emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed an appeal on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of the democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and strengthen the symptoms of breathing" such as asthma.
Council of Ministers wants Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: in case of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community area in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part is signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take time for the area to be owned by the church community to be part of the municipality, there is no longer a planning obstacle to the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a Community area for this purpose.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are planning to provide such a community space not only as a meeting point for the residents of the senior-level residence, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision which was taken by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn will be taken by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision is designed to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a lump between the legs, to establish that both saddles - which are related to the construction of the environment - as well as pult roof - would be possible, which reduces the top level and makes the construction economically possible.
Needless, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, he will unanimously pass the body.
It's not that easy with the common space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which you don't get so far ahead, so now you are leaning out of the window at the community room, she says, "I'm doing it hard."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely opposed to community participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any investment or even foreign investor.
That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no grant, but a genuine countervalue, which is, in doubt, marketable, is the opposite.
There are three supporters of the request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly.
For example, in the case of two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Cycling on road
A 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and severely injured during the crossing of the road.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bicycle on the cycle path of the Schwarzer Weg road coming from Hilden at 12.20 am.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road At Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger driver running in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove to the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the onward traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ride car.
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must let the game cast against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
In front of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 o'clock/ZDF and Eurosport), the staff care at the German football record champion Bayern München is getting bigger and bigger at Pokal winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat lack.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good last time."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, expecting a "silenceful, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their banner.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first "star trail" is to be developed across Germany.
This is what the Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg association plans to do.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information need of many Harz visitors, it was called.
He connects nature, science, movement and sporty performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
Inquiries came from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hochgeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the star trail train is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot about the physics of each star," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it is much farther away.
Also mediated is the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has operated in the St. Andreasberg mountain town of Norddeutsland's highest-location Observatory.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly.
Since 2003 there has been something similar to the planned starring planet path in the university city on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads up to Hainberg and to the Observatory - as well as an "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Sameen) with the planet Sedna.
The stones with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are placed exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planet's route is just four kilometers.
While the light needs about eight hours from sun to pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to steal with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fix star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaakko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomätenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion who went down the hall to welcome Lomakenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachtko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posing for photos, Lomäcko-Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I've risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on to lighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomaenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomakenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 Knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed themselves openly at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomakko as "a huge fighter," and he might be participating in his Saturday camp.
But Lomaenko stopped by the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he was seeing the trifle champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey...you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength, then box.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomaenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre pitcher
In the event of an accident on the A7 four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 16.30 a.m. just before the connection point Market is likely to spread according to a tyre pitcher.
The car smuggled to the right into the bush, where it slid across and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured during the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour, and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkete works better"
After the 2:2, Andre Hoffmann hopes for the beginning of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue will bring points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, there would not have been the two opposite gates at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two countertowers too much, and we have to be even better watchful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain will also be further optimised.
And a gate after a free-float doesn't want to catch the Fortunes any more.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one is standing next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better off even after the experience of preparing with the triple chain than with the quadruple chain.
"But I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we just have in the triple chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"Requirement is, but that we are even better able to harmonize and we do not make so many play errors in the structure."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a wrong start after a difference, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be interrupted early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the Aue players might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so much where they're currently standing," says Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as an easy favorite on Sunday.
"That we wipe them away, just because we have the right to get under the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance in just a defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There are no teams in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the beginning," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and obsessive."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The latest results of asylum-seekers tests in Sweden, which were subjected to a new medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics in recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "proposal that the subject be 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are made of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgeting a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18 it is about 10 percent in this case."
Full of the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs super," says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the road and traffic department in the government president Freiburg.
In April, the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitated bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is planned for October and light is confident that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge, dressed with red sandstone and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at Lauterbach's local entrance has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30-metre wide and seven-ton-high so-called bridge cap.
This is a margin fastening that is also used as a way of operating.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
That's where the pedestrian path is to run.
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
A special sense of fingertips has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
In the run-up to the work, the locals were informed by handlists about the project.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collection weiher towards Schramberg, traffic is one-track regulated by a traffic lights.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully blocked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is a total of 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at the German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to take a stand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to take a hat.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel District Day (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that on this day shows peaceful flag because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell invites to the poster "great election campaign start".
And familiar names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the vice president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already there hours before the event starts do not want to listen to the AfD teachers but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well square, but now takes place in the parking space below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the forums A world and one of the major organizers, is really happy: "Doll, how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including a "urGerman potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, especially at the railway station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get on Gerolstein anyway?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Laurentiuskirms there were not enough parking spaces.
So the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
Looking at the event on the Rondell front, he says: "This is the good right of the people, most importantly, it remains peaceful".
That's what it does: At around 8 p.m. on the Rondelvorplatz, a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy president Beatrix von Storch to speak.
The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the front square have a longer breath, but there is also a call to clean up shortly after 21am.
The police can withdraw - no special incidents.
Trombone Meets Trumpet
A resound with the Wolfach Posunist Frederic Belli there are in the series Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov Solotromper is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
In this way Johann Sebastian Bach sings himself together with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho laureate Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and the free play are combined with a fascinating work of art.
This core part of the program was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything out," says Kristen Stewart openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?"
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was Robert Pattinson's "Twilight" colleagues, who eventually disintegrated bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I had dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but at school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'girl, be proud of you!'
Especially the public do not like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that is annoy me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement in which it said: "The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is unleaded from the top to the bottom and is unable to find a positive, agreed message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world’s chief of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sports.
Russia's athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletic World Championships that the banning of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away in competitions with gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoicing" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral actors at the athletic World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work, said he is reporting in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Tragedy for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a mourning celebration in Fritzlar, around 1000 people of the two were killed by a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
To the unexplained crash, Minister of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two killed pilots as "the king of their subject."
"We owe ourselves to this highest sacrifice they have produced on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old captain from North Hesse had died in the West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their sarge was transferred to Germany and on Thursday was accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
Then began the funeral in the circle of the family, closeest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were the Prime Minister of Hesse Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The rest of the population was left to the south, and the rest of the population was left to the south.
Before the church Fritzlars and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and operating.
The Chief of Staff had built the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, of whom the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn down the crash, no one would have liked it."
The Minister of the Leyen did not show any doubt about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not make any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was what the royal house told us on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish couple are buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed to the decision of her husband, said it further in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a heel out of not being happy with his title.
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016, he retired and finished the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last rest of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's contemplations, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year reign at the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Some months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluent, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and which in this country had the reputation of being the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for tolerance.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid reelection
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green majority government for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to withdraw.
Because on Friday it was for the resolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from their Landtag Group in Lower Saxony had led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green Member Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
Mr Björn Thümler is proposing to include his group.
CDU and FDP have a total of 69 seats in Lower Saxon Country Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be chosen regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Because, however, it is essential that the country day decide its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide further on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag withdrawing from the Prime Minister's confidence and choosing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be checked legally clean," said Thümler.
"You will calmly discuss all questions when they are properly tested."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curios."
The politician himself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the abject Members to return to their country mandate.
"We of course assume that she will return her landtag mandate, which she has received via the green country list with immediate effect," said the state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Koerner.
The Group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We particularly regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"In the context that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the crossing of the Lower Saxon Green Members Elke Twesten to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters, but also betrayal to Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of Red-Greens in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests for the welfare of the country", criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Mr Björn Thümler, Minister of State at the Federal Republic of Germany, wishes to recommend to his honourable Member that each of the twest be included in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that Twesten should distort the result of the 2013 Landtag election with a personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD at the time, but there was a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany talks about contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) Speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Alert.de, the Länder provide the latest information on the egg charts concerned.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if after everything we know at present a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenmenter is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since being aware of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
As with manufacturers, trade has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
Untaxed eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly indebted.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the serious case.
Is there only a lack of staff or executive responsibility?
It was just the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is why a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors are crucial in cases where crimes may exist.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a clear explanation.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly discouraged.
Through the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food supplied animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be consistent and worked with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to be informed in a timely and complete manner.
How the financial rules of football on Neymar's move to Paris affect
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar receives a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by Katar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to fight against legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in improving the team and building a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP forecast period running until 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen by the Presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount of the accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of the proceeds can be entered in the annual financial statements for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the most severe sanctions with the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by bloating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarised company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring would exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PPE sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments from the World Cup 2022 organization committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and could be easy to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to ignore the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.
They talked to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because one can walk different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In the past few years, Chocolate Frey has produced an on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to the sweet cooperation: the airline re-examinations the contract.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
Products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-whites packed Schoggi plates to 14 grams per year distribute flight companions to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is all the more important: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious contract.
How many candidates are available in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006 Swiss chocolate tapes have been distributing their flights on board.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short distance, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolate Frey, both in business as well as in the Economy Class.
athletics - Diskus-Olympicator Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time World Champion fights for medals on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, failed in the national World Cup election and could only see the discus competition from the Tribune.
In the first attempt, the Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgie goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is scarce.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By playing on the core of the Gags - actors playing middle-aged children who will grow up - they still made the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the castor's principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Shatters the Cradle").
At one point one character is stifled by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy and evil plot, which includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of franchises.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old banger.
It's the moments of random insanity that could stimulate this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I think is his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" to Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring struggle iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-stoden Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes it pulls down, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lower length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef visited the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a situation.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with the herd.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants aged 25 to 77 were arrested, and arrest warrants had already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested for similar razzia in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian researchers.
A total of over 300 police were in service.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the prosecutor's office has been investigating constanz against organized drug trafficking in the south of Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a fair exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large stake was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia came to the eye of the investigations.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gangs.
way complains big gaps in the Ausländer register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the Ausländer register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misconceptions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Ausländerzentralregister.
Deficits in the data recorded there could lead to "to some serious misconceptions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warning of the analysis presented by the "South German newspaper".
The register records ten million foreign nationals, some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is thus managed by some 600 alien authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who have not been alive for a long time, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register."
"Inaccurate data inputs can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
In addition, the statistics on aliens are covered by EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such false assignments led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with expatriates", it says in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they have arrived from there.
This is the result of an internal paper published by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper says that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "in respect of families with children, except for infants and infants, to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically impossible, according to the newspaper's reference to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Convention, refugees from the EU Member States are responsible for what they first achieve.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of origin.
For reasons of reason, the Office has now written: "In the meantime, the capacity for children with minors in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The National Political spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Family with children threatens human rights and child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the community appreciates the increased willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our bodies are designed to do this and we'll pay due respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even to that end," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the cannings are broken down into their components.
Three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK Head of Creativity.
Obviously, a few years ago, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half so many account for Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave out 500 milliliters each of their lives' juices.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "loan" when it maintains interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee (MPC) policy-makers voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members targeting an increase this month, as the weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure would continue on household income, while inflation is expected to increase to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to boost Brexit's inflation and said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected on financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut business package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, it repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "a little greater" than expected markets.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The Bank's downward-corrected growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% forecast in May and 1.7%.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these messages to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the rise in expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor increases in salary, as the deterioration first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "improve" income entry in the coming years, but she added that wages will recover "explainably" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate part of lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote which caused the sinking of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the reputation for an increase in interest rates had increased, as inflation was increasing pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy-makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and it would rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2% would be "exactly due to" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who make the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free-of-charge options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will be given access to a "transrative" HIV prevention treatment following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared his willingness to finance the trial after the appeal court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "a decisive moment".
Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (prEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV in the event of infectious diseases.
Taking PREP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics appropriate participants agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a private doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to use, absorb and implement it on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if directed towards needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Management Board of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been purchased, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadow Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and how this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us to get closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in Knightsbridge with my ex in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and on that day made an offer."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without us having to bend.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but to make the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all picks and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsed kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced MDF door.
"It is counterweighty, so that when you move the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute about one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul had already wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of his business assets and Paul has about a third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests that Paul manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitch Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who were employed by milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate in which Colin opened the family's first denture shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "are embittered about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was held back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be solved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit President's media absence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first one.
Politico reports that the new head of staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with executives on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefs - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," said former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump did not send.
If his employees already managed to keep him away from him several times, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to bring their own agenda forward by presenting Trump material that might promote their views of the world.
In May, Politico, who deals with this story, reported on the preferences of the consultants to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he will find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of the article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staffwoman Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had in the past uttered false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, receive the Trump."
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most Visited Criminals Get Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people's assistance is sought and hoped for.
Police throughout Europe sent out (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after offenders are not naturally known, clues from the population are hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday the action following the winter's "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been visited, more than 2.5 million times.
36 of online visitors could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a grave and return to the 'Millionaires series'
Some of the richest homeowners of the West Midlands are again standing with some determined travelers on war foot who have negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to ask for a field back in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "Millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but they were not scared by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their seizures.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "unusual to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
One speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on March 1st next year.
These are good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambiance operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30,000 nights were lost per year and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time.
But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and was already talking about serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the delight city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They're called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the previous Hotel Birkenhof have been in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly degraded, old baths removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high city center level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand up wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The views of the city were consistent with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the level of investments asked, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
Just under one million euros, he's counting.
The exteriors are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In an courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affair: US Special Mediator uses Grand Jury
In the Russia-Affair for US President Donald Trump, according to a report, special mediator Robert Mueller has used a so-called Grand Jury.
The body started work in the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" phoning people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The station CNN reported that there were already first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
For a long time, US intelligence services have accused Kremlin of being specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men acting as advisers to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the lupe.
A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special Mediator had personally put Trump in the center and examined the allegation that the president might have hindered the justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments.
Mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be switched on by the prosecutor's office to invite persons to be heard under oath.
According to the CNN station, precharges have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, it was stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then election chief Paul Manafort were also present in the conversation.
On Thursday evening, legal experts said in the U.S. television that the installation showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to depict Russia's affairs as a campaign for its political opponents.
"Russia's story is a total invention," Trump said.
The subject gives the democrats a way of "feeling well because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the introduction of a Grand Jury.
This, however, usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special intermediary in a "fair" manner.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not against the president.
No reason was assumed to have changed to that, it continued to be stated in the statement.
Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this noise, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against Michael Flynn, the then National Security Advisor.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.
The solution to the speculation was whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special agent of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair for the later retiring President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's insistence by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special agent could no longer be released as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg driving in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis a giant iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has solved from the reel ice.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, on Wednesday.
The colossal weight over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres of large colossus is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
There's no danger to humans.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-down colossus was part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shelkeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this peeling ice was the balance of waxes and breakdown a few years ago disturbed.
A complete peel ice had been broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some reason why Larsen C is in danger too, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can fall if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of the reel ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and push ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the reel ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Selfei is the fourth largest ice cream ice cream in Antarctica, according to AWI data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it would be controversial if the Larsen-C-Selfei would grow again or return in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not lead the destruction of this huge iceberg back to climate change, many ice shells of the Antarctic peninsula have fallen down in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
In the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees and thus count to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants home tariff at the staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy jobs, the CDU calls for a withdrawal from the employers' association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the circular day win 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Some 620 applications were available for the places to be allocated this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 non-contained posts in the district of Metmann.
Doctors and engineers, as well as general administration forces, are being sought.
The CDU now intends to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circuit day and to address the lack of expertise in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to "form a concept for staffing and human resources development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals but to counter the applicant's scarcity in the future, says it.
The overall concept should be based on the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cleaneers and include a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one had never known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a "compete of public employers".
In addition, there are a high number of employees who leave the service for sickness or old age.
The maximum time for action, therefore, is that no more posts remain unplaced.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a terrible surprise in the circuit day when he questioned the personnel cost cover publicly and the other parties were astounded.
Peoples would like to see a review of all possibilities that allow for withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the districts - should seek a household rate," says Völker.
The CDU is therefore trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service tariff regulation actually provides.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.
But the role of the circle has grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutional Protection Act.
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGOs' rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Savet' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself to detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all accusations that are currently being filed after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take tow-boat migrants on board, who will be delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave for the ships to be used again.
At least one such meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of evading itself over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared themselves ready to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable since they would not bring with them "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization of Physicians without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived after rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascents and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Plalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
The views followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pälzer Wald and the previous plains.
In between, there were always longer increases for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day, Bad Dürkheim went to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoints arose, combined with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days many meters of altitude had been announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers at the open-air hall breathe in healing Sole.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting over the stadium grass with wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sport has long been a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gallows included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga Associations, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that on this train several clubs still rise".
Next weekend, the Football World Association FIFA in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of various clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be present online far more often in these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In the e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Countstrikes" or even the football simulation FIFA are being fought at competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asia Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary for habituality.
Ingo Froböse too has dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response ability.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist highlights positively the high integrative effect of the e-port.
Players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, this resulted in EUR 50 million being implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales will amount to 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, the e-sport was "no longer removed from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already on the move internationally.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.
In Europe too, there is a great deal to be done.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football associations are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Chief Executive Officer Röttgermann.
Only falling into nostalgia, and clarifying the old times, is not enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"There's no way you can hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains the same as it always was."
Gift-Eier ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all the states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain fipronil should be taken into the shelf.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months on her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment was made.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "frightful circumstance she's completely sorry about."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read an explanation by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day when I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she'd be "successed" by the knowledge that she'd never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer have this only person with whom I have been with each day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s disclosure of text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stay up, jump from a building, start yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who in 2007 was sentenced to murder at her British companion in Italy before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michel Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lamb of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm it.
Something else was there in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, and he stopped the band assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first use as a Bayern captain.
Well, the opposition could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf, who had been selected from youth players, debutists and C-Elf, but he.
Sugarl is best distributed to those who want to be very trusted.
So anyone who has been chosen to enter the legacy of lamb can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini lamb.
Right behind, that's his position, the white tie on the arm did her evil.
And even Kimmich worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the rower into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troop.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal's ability to overplay his lack of fitness (floping hardly); Renato Sanches's coming out on devils to connect to the achievements of the Asia trip (sniffing only); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not show up negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked really well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign.
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times successfully during the game construction.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not the way we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Shifting the game, changing the pace: "I was also picked up for this style".
As unusual as this Bayern world is still for the new entrances, you saw next to the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven.
Kimmich resigned after a few cracky statements in the back of his new co-player.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new man any more.
Alba Motivated ÖFB Dams
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB dams
Austria's best-known football player reported himself on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB dams all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is actually a club colleague from ÖFB-Capital Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
Our ladies may need the famous Bayern shower well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy at the same time as the former Minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes on the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all".
Natus sees the largest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau between the 1 motorways is now very high in the country's priority list.
Even this year, the Ministry hopes for a plan-fixing procedure, until 2021 the building law is to stand.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the Trier West detour, which is in the primary need of the Bundesverkehrwegsplan.
The aim is to start operating the route in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as suggested by Wissing, to add a Rhineland-Palatinate label to the wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling short for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says CEO Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the existing master exam and 2500 euros is foreseen when graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is a quick way to create facts, while the necessary staff is missing from the country, says Jan Glockauer, the IHK Trier's chief executive.
Of 56 new engineers who want to recruit Wissing in the country business mobility, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU fractional rate Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Furthermore, the current broadband expansion in the country was disillusioned.
In 2016, regional companies had only assessed network supply in an IHK survey with a score of 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economics Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Force Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she had already given way to the field after four months of inconsistencies.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with embezzling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but return in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged with Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to bypass the emission regulations in Europe, and a request that concentrated on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft runs through Munich on tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
The Isar, who draws it again on Saturday, will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building unit wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a big info transparent.
It shows a dump.
The beginning of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wear love is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wildlife flow.
Last summer the fleet drove across the Isar, and even this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-published cartoon drawings, the tubular noses of his figures are his trademark.
Also with 85 the Argentines are still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laughing, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he hit himself through, among other things, as a signer for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost," he once said.
After stationing in Lima, New York and Paris, he was able to break through at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large round Mordillo figures are revolving in drawings with the steep Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About Calendar, Puzzles, Books for Big and Small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, its dreary figures continue to spread around the world.
He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as a opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions of drought and disease-borne insects, which is causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits diggers, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much needed for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cranes, fuses, merchants, vagants or a local camp are to be experienced these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The members of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporter to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings rich.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of salaries of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest period of violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nito took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and up to now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorneyship was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists it only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unrestrained and although the terrain is still more treacherous.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting on security discussion has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all trust."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of Riodoce newspaper in Culiacan's capital.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfter Fluss".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown-up children.
In Culiacan, rumors tend to fly around freely.
But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoles for drug cans that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is to be blamed for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own safety after another newspaper had been confiscated, which had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper earned a call because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard - touching investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she went.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take over the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayaquil, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine ruin?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they can do their best work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and landings" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censor and self-retainment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce's employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibit on the state expenditure focused on the governor's home city.
And there was a group that had a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), which ruled all political levels almost throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high levels of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the Valdez Column as the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"We'd known what happened before," Villarreal, 46 said, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office was relocated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the staff became something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught up with a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.
All over the country, journalists have become louder by writing down on walkways and buildings in organized protests "SOS Press".
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "tolerated" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organized crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a editorial on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on last Friday, when the last issue had ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when at one time all their phones began to sound.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren were hounding up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the Riodoce employees followed his tracks.
"How can you think of closing," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his sluggish skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "sudden past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-kept armored dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs exhibition in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier, who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Creed era.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant ferret is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when, on March 21, 2011, he grubbed in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met up with something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthflower.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only flash a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.
"It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-esteem, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing in its surroundings and avoiding its enemies, experts say, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors about his body.
They discovered the counterchatization, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counterchatisation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution promoted the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals using counterschating - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestine content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At this time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved supple skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Creed age.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just shivering with your eyes, you might almost believe he's sleeping."
The Creed was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurias, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when, on March 21, 2011, he grubbed in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch tips, which were stretched from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded by western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the Dinosaurier saved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tanks along the Dinosaurier
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'selling as a profit in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned residues of the skin still cover the hollow tanks that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot lies at his side, his five fingers spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambomage.
There are numerous injured, kilometres long traffic jams - and Gaffer.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) some 20 people were injured on the late afternoon of Thursday at a mass caramboo location.
According to the police's first information, about 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
No data were available on the exact number of injured at first.
It was about slight to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A big ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident scene.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstau was formed about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the opposite track - by numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle divers, which now have to be expected with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on his way to the accident station.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's experienced: Nothing imaginative is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deeply involved in his work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the sheepman and wakes an insanity or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket check.
But the times of interruption are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unscrupulous ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take its place and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we'll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many further long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said one railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" means the train calls the ticket classification without a creative.
In order to be able to use these, however, some requirements need to be met: a smartphone or tablet is needed.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.
You must also use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: One gets into the train, calls up his ticket under "My Tickets".
In the case of the test customers, a button for electronic extraction appears.
The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train crew member comes in at Platz Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without a ticket control, you can check in with the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernfahrt.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs".
Those who drive often know that next to delays and missed trains the ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you yourself, in any case but one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to extract online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document is required to prove.
The result are endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad moods in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and at the end takes time for the creator to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this is also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet accessible.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis's born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented her and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it was called there.
Confused, as no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly reseconded on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put off her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman insecured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we used to get used to and we can call it typical."
At that moment, I felt Shültfrost.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe about?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only to be active and organized, but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience in which she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black woman girl.
I feel I'd give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florist Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell started to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
During an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis, a former co-director, an artist from the field known for his activeism around death-traffic inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team from Whose Streets in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I shall be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but rather a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was on the front, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a singing and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "Trum" to "Größenwahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall on the south side of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly, the theme hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While they say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schuster), comes from the other side: "Don't burn a man" (Siggi bets) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The Gallery-Makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very much loved.
We've also discovered the buttocks for us.
We wish that even during and above all after the gallery's construction there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
In other cities there are also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent is up.
But it is not likely to be very low on the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where to shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's plenty of it already in our city.
You can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved to us.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also price-valued.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Harm, special shops are almost gone, and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit me together.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a permanent basis, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or is the ghost bit gallery already able to dispel all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And there's no need for a shopping center that's empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farmer's market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - there is no place for senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."
A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarkably alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst forged a 35-year prison sentence after making classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Coming Resemblance (An Suitable Similarity).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-wife and ground-breaking dissident whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits how someone with these genomic data might look, created a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, born in Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which manning apparently unwell sits on a driver's seat and wears a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from Forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press review of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her detained muse became uneven letters friends who over the course of two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, twofold ways to further defuse the rigid divisions that he should actually correct.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been sex, race, sexuality and culture" with its super-great signature (the "i" in her family name).
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take along is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own space, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free phone in her hand from the U.S. disciplinary arsenals like King Kong.
"If they colden your speech, they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who says greetings from Philadelphia.
"I still get geese skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then in the middle of the room she will be welcomed by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford for killing
A national hunt for people is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are sought after as a suspect after a man has been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued for murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of Cook County's District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several tricks.
A community warning system published by Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives investigated the stings as murder, while the police actively sought the two suspects, said officers.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasure assistant at Oxford University.
One speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, saying that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the Roadmap criteria, RUSA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap was updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for re-establishing RUSSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"All things have been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to accept publicly the reported results of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren approved by WADA on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the Doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi has not sold any eggs yet
This was shared by the corporate groups.
The communication stated that it was a purely precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue.
From now on only eggs should be supplied to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-irrigated agents.
Aldi therefore wants to make clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee's luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the trial.
"There was no consistency and objectivity," said Erret, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Rescued said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel with glint in the three years.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so that you can drill out why.
Companies come to see that there is a need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $181.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, starting up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit at the beginning of this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies are sending customized "puls" surveys, collecting confidential answers in real time and viewing the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found to treat its employees badly or to behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee-fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously identified and addressed by executives sitting in offices in cities or states such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices can be identified more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who is head of Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company started to take more seriously ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen broke up due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media got to their right" that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which all capital was raised to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of businesses, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
High salaries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are involved and committed.
If the Analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture are important.
But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take any action.
Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demot employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on collecting data.
"For if you don't follow employees ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of that?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to launch measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Erret.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you will also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new field of practice on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey top parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to the Waterman Football Center after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real tretmühle for the boys the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time while Moras was playing six times in Westwood.
In August 18 exercises are scheduled to take place. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA's change of rules, even if she adds another point to the many careerd routes of the players.
"We put this enormous load on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will terminate its practices as soon as the camp has ended, which will not be an easy task in view of the clear visibility of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been thrown with footballs, which have cleared a protection net behind a pedestal.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far from thinking that people there rent a room and then set themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact-readers and show their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of his efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misreports and send them to fact-readers who may display results of the fact-reading from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they are unable to quickly eliminate hateful posts as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that a test of the new facts review will be started in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories of third party fact-readers are being challenged, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his younger past, the little Scoty Castle was on display in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moof-haired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was lit on account of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself with it.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overestimated my greetings") it all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank whiskey and started writing.
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "dogs of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who knew what: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to which two families fought.
Guys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is represented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a Gauner, to make debt over and over again and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to recruit into."
After the end of his deployment in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elemenmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish the fucking life."
Campaign started: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle hidden in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof mark (saw of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"It's too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking about the posters on the Rhöndorf chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website that is open yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that a lot is better than it seems.
In essence, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well."
The action is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to make a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive single-position feature."
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium-sized five-digit amount to its new roof mark and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officers' corps.
So did this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
This made the civilians in the YAS numerous.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been suspended.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile-presidier Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wiredriver of the coup.
Against 486 persons who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coupt attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan called the overthrow attempt a "gift gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean completely" the forces.
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen in the Military headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifest themselves, among other things, in the removal of the headcloth ban for soldier women, wrote the newspaper.
The major cleaning of the army and the security forces continue anyway.
In the middle of July, Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants by decree, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real lords of the country.
Three times, they referred to their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least with reference to the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan is specifically driving forward an Islamization of armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-called officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not keep the nato cold.
There is no doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational skills are "lowed", say nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He intends to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to reorganize route for Rennsteigshuttle
Time and again, over the past few months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttles had been disputed - now it has to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the Maroden track on which the tourist train travels.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteigshuttles, according to the Transport Ministry, construction work on the route should begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and reorganising the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important connection, especially for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl, on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was about 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
On the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, the contract is currently being finally agreed, Sühl stated.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"With this, the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for 11 years.
This meant that the Rennsteig shuttle would be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a major railway link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly building in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it could not get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breast black and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more alarming, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the True Companion website warms up.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
It can be tired, fixed to conversation or it can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex rabbis - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugated female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step to Frigid (named here: repulsive) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their origin and their increasing refinery point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of equality of sexes towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they will still remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture.
But what goes out of the margin zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market allows them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexual assault on women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The report of the maid') is not the graphic images, the ensnared bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically as possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are fallen slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense
The Trump era has become a tenacity that the political divisions that polarized the US electoral system have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and the festival there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s elected relatives.
We're all supposedly stricting ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed was the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had struggled for decades because of politics, is suddenly and very peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but I find it in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disillusioning effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the dire possibility that one day his kittens will no longer dispel us.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize" which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitome of reasonableness.
Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the roof of the car, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - both in comparison to Trump actually occur as a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritually healthy only to qualify as immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are curly and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just right to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite past the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the subject-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but rather a big circle in the north of London.
The central park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked about it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink - this to buy something about the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinningly grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius shifts breastache from prison to hospital
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he said he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to use Pistorius Appeal's six-year imprisonment this time, which they say is too suspicious.
The national law enforcement authority said it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of his sentence being increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the retiring students will go to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at Biesental Citizens' House in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken court, but then was released into freedom.
In addition, the mint band performed a musical titled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke, and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles that carried cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stood for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal was different from the other young animals (cows), it was part of it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
They followed thanks to the colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who regularly jumps into teaching passports, and the parents.
The chick age was now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she was very reluctant to release her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
Finally, all students made a song of summer time and holiday time come.
This brought great joy to the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV.
On the morning of August 1st, in Sithonia, a group of illegitimate people were arrested by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers participate in the project?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of Euro 5 emission class cars and some Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before apply only to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has ordered the Kraftfahr-Bundesamt (KBA).
How and when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet stated an exact date.
Daimler has informed everyone concerned.
If an inspection is required anyway, that will be done in their context.
How long should the changes overall take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The upgrade itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is believed that foreign manufacturers would go after it.
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there have so far been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honours.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
The award winner Lear, known as progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he should refrain from participating in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to withdraw the funds - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The previous prizewinners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We're making the city live worth
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The post has already been written out - however, suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work is still great fun to him, as he does in the press conference.
He reports on varied but demanding tasks that await his successors.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next opportunity.
Thus, in line with the regular termination periods, sufficient time is still to be allowed to enter.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit such conclusions.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they can no longer fill this out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But the city and itself are important to its citizens, says Wacker, who reports a good working environment and good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city live worth it", he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But in the future, varied projects are also on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have started.
The Kinzig bridge between Bolenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still topic.
The latter will hit beech with around 1.5 million euros alone, "if we do it properly," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is great scope for a city builder.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things could be responded quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under the protection of monuments, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the divorced city builder emphasizes.
After all, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything is running over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain with the job."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, please inform the city of Haslach, you should be able to present a completed degree as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building planning and planning law.
The Stadtbauamt stands under construction and civil engineering, planning of construction, basic employment, administration of urban properties, urban farm with construction yard and urban gardens, as well as under construction law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
A rosarot scooter and bicycle driver had been observed near the crime scene by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a buoyancy", said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrators or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train at risk.
In addition to the damage caused by the locomotive and the system, the delay and the costs of rail replacement traffic, the Pönals of the railway customers could also be sent to the perpetrators.
The speaker said that a total of "presumable" should be based on a sum of money.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south track could be carried without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains were stopped on Friday morning, two of them involved long-distance traffic.
The freight trains did not fall, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestine disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestine diseases.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory intestine disease can result.
Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their ingrains.
And the bacterium needs tryptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have produced a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoralist Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which had been kept separately, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestines of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach-dark tract.
The mice' dams were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal hormone and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach-dear tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan additives from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as well as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestine disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder's role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in favor of formalizing.
However, Matic had been excluded from the blues' pre-asia tour and only managed for 45 minutes what Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Ava Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of its four priorities.
"To get three out of four, for this I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great trouble."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State, but the drawing started in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD leader, social democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern before elections.
No interference fires from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the federal government - so was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have seen the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with counterwind in the approach.
There were depths.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber at the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising withdrawal of a Green Member of Parliament has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a severe crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the substituting Lower Saxony Green Member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The violation of the CDU means a clear distortion of the electoral will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the German Federal Managing Director and election leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"It can't be true," sighs a SPD election fighter when the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the encroachment of Green Members Elke Twesten to CDU without its own majority of governments.
It is the preliminary highlight of a series of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The miser began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything would be different.
That became it - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite had the party smoothly relocated.
==References====External links==
Then, when they just took on new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next downpour.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much wrong in crisis communication afterwards, which one can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for a long time.
My survey figures were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps for that reason, because in the past few weeks has tried to put accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also remained hidden from comrades in the Martin Schulz area.
They had him given because they promised that the party would be stabilised.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because there is basically no blame for the party-in-the-party twilight of the Low Saxon Greens.
And Schulz isn't at all.
On the other hand, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the abject parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratically damaging, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD-Bundestag Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament as a direct candidate because of her person, but through the national list of the Lower Saxon Greens, said the Lower Saxon Members.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD government, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate's will was clear four years ago: People made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the backgrounds.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there has been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
If you want to renovate your house coming into the years, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed urban development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look back on what had been happening so far.
Since 1991, there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success" project - it is also important to promote internal development, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe government Presidency received the information that there will be a reorganisation area III.
The amount of funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 were from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a renovation area now created?
So Schindler continues to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in reorganising whether there is interest in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the territorial boundaries could then be relocated.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal State programme "Social City" in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject to object reference, i.e. per plot.
The reorganisation area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the funding will run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year the stocktaking would be carried out, in the context of which the interested parties in the rehabilitation area will be asked to fill out a questionnaire.
In November or December, the Statute decision will be taken as far as possible, so that the renovations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each commune had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary examinations.
The aim is to evaluate urban problems and decide when and to what extent.
A reorganisation notice will then be entered in the basic book for the land concerned.
Pietzschmann will come again after Empfingen and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc", which includes, among other things, the structural condition and the restoration prospects.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Householding and Housing Arch", details of the size, division and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating arc" shall be completed only if business is operated in the building.
However, attention should be paid to the fact that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures would not be eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds is working according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, first mills.
You can't "reserve" subsidies for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Locationskern II" were shown in order to make the existing ones a "beautiful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and toy finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an Anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military records left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that on July 17th, around 7 a.m., the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6:00 p.m. and 21:00 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of the hours of service a second team would need to fly back.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit security staff remained on the plane during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the Commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President took the initiative to reform health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to reduce government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane made taxi services in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to stop US presidents in the White House with precise centimetre rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew for 11 hours this day for "non-Presidentship support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs of the US Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"The cost of taxpayers based on estimates of the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At this time, the former White House press officer Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and snarled with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
The second tennis league is the leader in the searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. on the SV Table Triede Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite the fact that after five games the second tennis league's top rider has been still in a flawless balance, the reality has become the point.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just in the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the searchsdorfer SV mainly the imports from the high north ensure.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Soren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That's going to be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north stands practically.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the current challenger tournament in the Italian Biella is not the Bundesliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be the first to play in this season.
The previously unfavourable Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball yesterday with the White Rush Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschup, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also get back to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainer's staff around Marius Zay will fill the cadre.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really work happily when he signed the law on strengthening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his Haste, to pass the law," the Congress packed in a few "constitutional non-constitutional regulations," he said.
Also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was fighting the U.S. move.
After all, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, together with other European companies, have been concerned about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipe Nord Stream 2.
The throttle scenery is huge.
However, it was too early to assess the impact, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" has looked at what the group could resist and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is put to the centre in the hit line of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos that Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Accompanied by four powerful fathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invited to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backward: The city has 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With fixed contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city children's day care places.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own domain.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Aid Department, this is a good message: "We were all very happy".
Boiled is still out of house: A Caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled.
The city operates 46 day care places in the Krefeld area, 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last Kita year, 2800 children sat at the tables each, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the middle of the day, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat in the Kita at lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in 35 hours care if children stay until 14 o'clock."
46 part-time workers have kitchen services starting from September 1st: they heat up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meal individually, giving out the food, clear up, rinse and cleanse the kitchen.
"The employees are definitely assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour range.
"The kitchen assistants now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the chain management."
Because it's also about: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen services, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - also has the charm that it has shown itself to be the most economical for the city in comparison with the cost of self-sufficiency and foreign distribution, says the Press Office.
And this, although 46 part-time forces are being re-set.
"But these hours don't fall into the weight of about 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of Mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women will run in the council elections in the provinces. Three women run for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße at around 14.55 a.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request, and went on with her friends.
After that, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which, however, was wrong.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigation is running.
GMB management of investments in the McVision factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure of the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow with managers of the McVitie biskuit manufacturer.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than five million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager GMB Scotland McVision's call for "thinking that financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be driven forward".
GMB-Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross from the General-Site-Manager concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour force has concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVition".
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the location, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago?
La Liga's page likes to regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s highest paid professional sportsmen. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelafi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to be one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to be signed by one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown down and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter placed in the Königsfelder street in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle’s property of more than 200 euros.
The police station Schramberg, telephone 07422/27 01-0, asks for advice.
To an accident on B 215 between Stolzenau and Reade, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he encountered a car on his lane, the driver of a VW touran had to avoid and touch the guide board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on his way to read at 19.55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of Stolzenau's turn, a car came across on his lane, so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver was touched by the lead board.
In the car, damage to property arose.
The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the Versacher vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspots report relieves Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weiser, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German press agency, he expects an excuse from the former Bishop of Regensburg and Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the palaces is measured by "twofold measure".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "indignant and shameful deeds" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but be the "degree of media manipulation", according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to hold that normal," says Scarfia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerische Rundfunk: "You're happy to go to church and that's a found food."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "slaughter was a normal educational tool" was "to be done with funny children like me."
They feel it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Full of injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the book of memories "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I need to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the Bishop Ulrich Weber with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were "with high plausibility" victims of attacks between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be held that in many cases Domkapelmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more severe.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accused people, many victims valued the general humanity of R. and thus, despite violence, even link positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is as though it were relieved.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "provisions of violence in the protection of the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choler and perfectionist, who became the ophthaler handy when a domspatz brought musically no top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even present in it.
He has just eight sides dedicated to him, and he is clearly denied any suspicion of fellow or conciliation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The exxes of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of activity.
In any case, it can be accused of being too late to learn about it or of not taking first remarks seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all those surveyed as, literally, "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
The broad majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents an excellent witness, describes him as "warm-hearted", "loving", "righteous", "competent" and "comprehensible", as an extremely kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and was "always relocated by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to arousals of anger.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the key band on the ground, but also spread ear figs and pulled all too bad boys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
It must be said, however, that such education methods were widely used in parents and teachers in the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you also know any of these methods of training?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
In comparison with what this report is about, namely, the horrendous sexual abuse and the extremity of violence at pre-school, this is, of course, a bagatelle.
The question is whether it has to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen upon him.
Many of those who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also being burdened with any involvement or conciliation with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have trusted the master of the cathedral chapel.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," one of the people concerned said, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the domspatz-student Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student formulated it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I consider it ... also for truly absurd to assume that it is to be expected that ... bubs of intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, boarding leaders, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The students and/or their surroundings entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of any conciliation.
Nor can he be accused of preventing him or being notified.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these violent crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media a lot of "waltexesssen" was read at the Regensburg Cathedral Pastes.
The former master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between preschools and the gymnasium of doms, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible puzzling education, the cases in which boys were regularly harassed and tortured by sadistic teachers, and who suffered horribly under it, took place all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pijpenhofen, where really scandalous states must have ruled.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that was the topic of "Preschool" taboo, as most of the witnesses stressed.
You were only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There has already been discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims valued the universal humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even link positive memories with him despite violence".
At most the accusation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which he was told about the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and from the procedures at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears in front of the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, as early as 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in the pre-school, the sentence will continue to be practiced."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when criminal penalties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us may still know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the sentence in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about "iftrick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards.
That's what the Princess's got.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and not to what has been broken up in preschool to violence and violence on innocent children's souls, which is far beyond what is common at that time.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ear figs and hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also kept himself strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger present in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating punishment come into play?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral patches played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not mention that he led a strict regiment there.
But even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, from the then more nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, from which to date they went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, no matter in what field, but always discipline, passion and self-surpassion.
What kind of person have you seen Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have always experienced it as wonderful, humorous, ground-friendly, deeply believing and heart-good people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something bad even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former doms still today, 23 years after his emeritus, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most doms are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a dear respectable person to whom they still look up today and whom they just worship.
And please, once again quite clearly: All that is proposed to him are education methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad we've overcome this time for a long time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a mediae scapegoat.
There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.
Because the report that was just published relieves him.
Now, the appeal would be to offer a 93-year-old man who earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would ever know the Regensburg Cathedrals to finally leave in peace.
