Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
The proposal to change its title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is a cause of concern to some members of the National Assembly.
The reasons for this are plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party's members of the National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name "with "Twp" and "Pwp".
For non-walisans readers: in Welsh "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently drafts a law on name change, said: "The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which showed wide support for the Welsh Parliament for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the "Welsh Parliament Members" or "WMPs" body preferred, while the "MWP" option was the largest support during a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly apparently propose alternative options, but it could be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones to present a draft law within weeks.
The Act on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the committee system.
National Assembly members may vote on their name at the end of their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was put in place to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is imposed on the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent given the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke with said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there are no more two."
He said the disappearance of the bars was comprehensible.
"Today's social life looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people find themselves on a regular basis."
At the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders assume and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with apartments in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus the complete closure of these churches is accelerated, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to adjust or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but when Father Johnson's parish members planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the belfry as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who rang the bell game in July, used other words: 'A treasure of culture' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first belfry game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had been converted to the larger game of bells in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has occurred in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors, which were partly drawn by the church's laity leaders and partly by the diocese of Bishops.
In July, the municipal board of directors of the municipality, which consists of lay leaders, expressed concern about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the council, although it had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds diving to Lobster
In California on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving to Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and went with several others to the boy to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praise. But then he realized that the boy screamed “I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been torn apart.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’,” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks on stores of presumptuous cosmetics departments occupied by specialized assistants, boots, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale advance on the 2.8 billion UK pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments are tested throughout the country in eleven branches. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use previously used storage spaces for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the range of its cosmetics for the first time doubles up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is rebooting its "Boutique" make-up series, which makes most of the products vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch sales offices. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local consumer goods stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to cause customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since purchasing the Argos and Habitat Chains two years ago, Sainsbury's company has established hundreds of stores of Argos sales offices and a number of habitat sales offices, which has increased food turnover and profitability of takeovers.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, which ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenue from the drugstore dealers' branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in so far as an extended range of luxury home care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy are added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the seductive environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that question the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "wounding" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from a business worth 11 million UK pounds
"Dragons" The"Star Peter Jones is "wonderful" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle branding company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 'This Morning' moderator, 37, announced its withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged Dragons The"Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "worthful" when the "Golden Girl" of television was given to the home-wear and accessories brand Truly, due to their new business – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure its future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV broadcast 'I'm A Celebrity'.
A nearby source named Jones said last night: "We do not comment on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He squeaked at the criticism he was expecting from the news media for a comment that some would be regarded as 'non-presidial', and for so positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a message moderator:
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a big step towards denucleization of North Korea.
However, denuclearization negotiations have fallen.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from around the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the US was holding to sanctions that were to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were faced with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and re-transmission of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would stand here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were expelled from Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for mobilising international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, so that is a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children puts together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure if foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officially evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international bodies should participate in relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still badly prepared for natural violence.
While in Aceh tsunami protection accommodation was built, these on other coastal strips are not an everyday sight.
In spite of a warning that was in force, apparently missing tsunami warning sirene in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travels between Indonesia's numerous islands are already a challenge in the optimum case.
Through natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the Indonesian infrastructure a key element of his election campaign and spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election of the Yoko suffers from financing deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practise a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes, when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation strike against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on the London Stamford-Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
At 0:1, Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 meters away from Chelsea's gate at about 0:1.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penitentiary and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizablaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get myself to this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I’ve just tried to make as much time as possible for me,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shot."
After a 25 minute hit, Chelsea led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard for half-time with 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle of the field.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard entered the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defenders behind and with a left-hand shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker, he left behind in the net.
Liverpool plays at the champions League's group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is on the other side of the UEFA Europa League Videoton in London on Thursday at 15:00.
Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia increase to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people should have been caught in the ruins of buildings that had been destroyed by the earthquake of strength 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, reported Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overshadowed by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for suspicion of murder after a woman was killed
After the find of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found on John Street at 7:55 p.m. with stinging wounds in Grayson Mews. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police call on the residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the scene to explore where they were found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police reported that she was in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved in the place of action.
It repeats again and again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were in the lockdown and another vehicle were in front of the lockdown.
Within the lockout, several police officers were in charge of the residence block.
Persons who have information shall be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolcc, to call number 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and to refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Statute in front of Parliament will be the newest monument of the dispute on the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatic puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'terrorism' and 'try to change history'.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was the goal in front of the palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor executed the image tower in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion and part of the history of a figure that many think is still worth being celebrated.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely true representation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killerschwein bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the last name was called 'Yuan', was found dead in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province with a divided arteries, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is ready to inject pigs vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to his report, he had arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig house was open.
He said that in the stable there was a big male pig with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had been bitten to the farmers.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," said Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 am to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
According to Yuan's family and market authorities, reports discuss compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilometer pig crammed a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could cover the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a businessman from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an "emissioner".
“They’re just playful.
They love to wander and are very curious, ... they are not intent on hurting someone.
You just have to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rain in the southwest of the USA
Hurricane Rosa is on the way across the colder water on the northern coast of Mexico, as predicted.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods of rain to North Mexico and the Southwest of the USA.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to be formed across the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the south-west of the USA.
Rosa will cause precipitation of up to 25 centimetres on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture in the coming days creates strong rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, floods floating in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation are expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall there is the possibility of flood-like flooding with rapid deterioration conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to tearing currents from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local windbows as well as wind that leads dust with them.
The approaching trough brings local rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total weights of over one cm above may be possible, which can lead to a small extent to the water-driving bulk and smooth lanes.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat attempts to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the center and east of the US, a warm beginning of October with wide-range temperatures is expected around 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the US.
Over 20 million viewers have seen board hearing Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million viewers have seen on six television networks the instigating statements of Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patt situation stopped. On Friday TV stations interrupted their regular program because of a turn at the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which the FBI is supposed to conduct a one-week investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high-school party that she had pressed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing, the figures were not available immediately.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
In order to get this into the right perspective, this corresponds to about the viewer numbers in a play-off football game or at the Oscar Award.
According to Nielsen, the station Fox News Channel, whose mean-orientated moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded an average of 5.69 million viewers of all-day hearings on average the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning he was filmed by cameras by CNN and CBS, how protesters urged him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for minutes with lowered eyes while he was being shot. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I am standing right in front of you here," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published and supplemented a statement before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later, when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transmission of the nomination of Kavanaughs for the vote to the whole Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, is calling for the accusations against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for withdrawal from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May meets the Conservative Party Day in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson tightened his attack on her so-called 'Chequers plan' for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual introduction of customs duties by the UK and the EU as 'full absurd'.
Deadly Shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, reportedly arrested and detained by Baton Rouge.
The authority published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station reports WAFB, the police assured the glasses at the crime scene and said that the glasses DNA had been found by Simpson.
After a poll, the police reported that he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The Advocate reports that the deposit had been set at US$350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police, Southern University Police, and citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU-Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for 'their care and their quest for justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball trainer Will Wade said that the team was “deeply shaken” about Wayde’s death and “stand in shock.”
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano feeds ash on Mexico City.
Ash thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater had increased and were registered within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ashes.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of caves and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics, since an earthquake of strength had shaken 7.1 Central Mexico in September 2017, established increased activity on the volcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital city.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to recall the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists, who were held back by the standby police, threw them with eggs and smuggled color powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the day, there was also a crowd of hands with the police who used their bats to control the fights.
For a number of hours, pro-independence groups 'no forget, no forgiveness', while facing Unionists calling for 'long live Spain'.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had opted for independence with overwhelming majority, even though the electoral participation was low, as the separatists largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes before the electoral offices.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he no longer saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could choose, but now we hang firmly," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties in maintaining the momentum of this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exiles imposed on themselves or in detention, where they are waiting for their procedures for organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been cut off by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who have been under investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the election of Europe, the best way is to denounce the reduction of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house had been rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, the gunpowder may have been shot on the car.
Menga-Riffer means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingstone secured the victory.
The increasing Livingston FC surprised Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team being able to match Hibernian during the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without having to win out and will face the Hearts that are eight points behind next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston is now able to increase his victory series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt has not recorded a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, since his directness put the Rangers ahead of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was down hereing to meet Craig Halkett's headshot at the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the crucial gate came into existence.
The Rangers let go of it, and Livingston prepared a chance at which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined Menga in shooting position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penitentiary.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball property, but could not overcome the host's defense, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely unimproved.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced the defense.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers-tower Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgov swung the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken got into Livingston's penitentiary again and again and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required criminal attacks – one of Halkett's against Glenn Middleton and one for handplay – were denied.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were absolutely excellent and exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her game and team have hardly changed since they returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has watched the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were on troop throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was inadequate – only once they could penetrate the host's team – and that's something like a wake call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons for holding a 25,000-person crowd from gathering in front of the mosque. Many followers, however, found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also received a hearing. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The contrasting protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German towers as hero and bemoaned by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclists die in collision with car
A cyclist died in London in a collision with a car.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Roadblocks and redirections for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in unrest
According to Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in unrest in a men's high-security prison.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Laartin in Worcestershire and still stops.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the disturbances involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officials were treated in the face because of minor injuries.
A spokesperson from Prison Service said: “It was used specifically trained prison staff to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Laartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police will be handed over and perhaps spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Laartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison leader was reported to have been treated by a prison prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, civil servants were called to prison to deal with severe disturbances in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (Durre areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pull over the southwest marked by deserts and bring with them the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flood-like floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach rain on Monday evening and cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers from the Arizonas border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation with a single up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest marked by deserts, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible and in total up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not risk flood floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the droughts in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, in part this rain is likely to be useful, as drought currently prevails in the southwest.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strengths with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet with colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet the strength of a tropical storm on land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico.
The rainfall may be severe in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation is expected from 7.5 to 15 cm, with up to 25 cm possible," saidweather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move northward across Mexico, reach the border with Arizona on early Tuesday morning as tropical depression, and then move up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
The National Hurricane Center informed the main threat to Rosa or its remains in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the south-west of the USA.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening floods and water-driving fires are expected in the desert and in mountainous areas of landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the find of a 16-year-old man with a death wound in Somerset, three boys in teenage age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
Teenager was found injured on Saturday around 4:00 p.m. British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked everyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said in front of the congress on Thursday and rejected the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
At the hearing, Ford also said that she was accused.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance sheet in the service for the general public," he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President was indirectly referring to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't act, but in reality I'm acting," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were looking at their mission to "resistance and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high-level employee of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed at earthquakes in Indonesia, victims increase
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away when, due to a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, huge waves hit the beaches.
On Friday hundreds of people gathered at a feast on the beach of Palu, when the darkness broke into the beach, up to six meters of high waves hit the beach and killed many people and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunami experienced an earthquake of strength 7.5 ahead of the Tsunami.
"When yesterday the threat of the tsunami arose, people still went to the beach to check their activities and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, tree trunks and houses with him, he met everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before he hit the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the run before the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air shots published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, fenced and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further post-quakes.
The earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released from the mass earthquake of Friday was in line with the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb that was thrown down to Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "overalling" and indicated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, and there was no information.
According to an explanation of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy already, but it could get much worse," said the Declaration.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticised for not having informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves were found to be official at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building who is desperately calling people on the street under him warning of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall on the shore will force and the buildings and cars will melt away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
As a result of the earthquake and the tsunami, there was a massive power failure that interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still urgently need food and other essential goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been re-opened for assistance.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in Evacuation Centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are accommodated in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but after words Dosebas passed by scenes of devastation.
"They said they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began with the hard task of putting disaster relief in motion, some assembled that skilled foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible when the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened until now.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, “okay, that’s a national catastrophe”, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for this on one of the miracles that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days beside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners in Roa-Roa-Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior at paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us how he spent the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp reports desperate to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, led only to grey question marks instead of blue hooks.
"I think that means that the news has not been sent," he said.
Thieves steal US$26.750 during the amount of ATM in Newport on the Life
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee thieves stole a Brink’s employee while filling up a US$26,750 ATM.
The vehicle driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to pay more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has the nickname Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change presupposes his performance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the show as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just a abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West according to his own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means “the only” became only “Ye” – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are rather."
It is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which West had previously worked, has already written his name with and without shroud and capital letters.
Mexico's Amlo praised not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised never to use military violence against the civilian population while the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military should not use any time to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers had fired a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people. At that time, left-right student movements were in place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training provided young people with criminal ties.
USA should double funds for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI-practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various US governments, even if the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so much behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest placed American Otello players. Later, he was senior at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to reading words, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes the top academic powers away, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited coryphages from universities that are supposed to work on AI.
According to Read, a changed US immigration policy could also be beneficial for US AI efforts.
"I think that in the field of AI doctoral staff, green cards should be offered automatically," he said.
China's State Council presented its plan for the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Read words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science should be involved. Furthermore, the White House announced the creation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced the investment of USD 2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would include decades of old conflict with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that it is entitled to the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has introduced a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign is in doubt that the electoral participation achieves the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: 'Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth taking up in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two thirds majority in Parliament.
The election commission said there had been no reports on irregularities by 13.00.
However, voting was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, in the referendum on the change of the country name that Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by persons who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the high head, not through the rear entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we are of dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'yes' result would be 'confirming our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum. This figure is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'Yes'.
In order for the referendum to succeed, 50 percent plus one vote must be taken.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to reach gate
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton in the 2–0 win of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton fighters and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penitentiary to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League team game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the Nationals were expelled from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another effort.
However, the always powerful Scherzer hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies who have a game advantage in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers for which playoffs.
With a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, the Rockies achieved at least one Wildcard, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are inclined, according to reports, to let jokers be thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th performance as a starter, practiced at the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington legal hand has a 18-7 season statistics, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President was indirectly referring to the situation in connection with Kavanaugh's board chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big big ones – I don't act, but I actually do, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “They see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the community, the abhorrence.
It doesn't matter to them who hurt them, who they have to go over to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, looked at their mission as 'resisting and blocking'.
'And you see this in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'a wretched and cruel and abominable and dishonest'.
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused noise to the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you leave the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer lets all opinions apply.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a series of Labour members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for having a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy was not in agreement with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that 'the meetings should involve everyone and be productive'.
Mostly the Friday-night GC sessions in my eight years as local Labour delegates were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today have not been marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendlyer, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged whether it is accepted by the Party's top.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party. Colleagues with whom I used to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn and take positions that I would never have agreed with otherwise – whether on national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – while it doesn't matter what I'm saying – a chimptirade follows in the social media that calls for my election, which appeals to the political center and says that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I have received are mostly of political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues, who daily face a flood of sexist or racist abuses and yet never give up small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer let all opinions apply, and with every mistrust request and any change to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to pull my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I didn't go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom was literally disintegrated in the entire school, the Labour Party joined, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a municipal council as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a heel out of my political views, nor in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unaware of my political positions and of areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: given the fact that the country is on a Brexit, that it will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
In fact, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not hold back so many threats of vote or political purpose from acting in my opinion to the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tengent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as to their better opportunities recovery, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognisance for Ayr, they have exploited their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Clima, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot started a non-excessive attempt.
Clima developed Ayr's leadership with a criminal step before he scored a hit directly at the half-time and then made an increased attempt at alone, so that it stood for Ayr at the break 17:5.
Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr developed its lead through an attempt of Stafford McDowall raised by Clima.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, Melrose paid the extra man through a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved a touchdown from the penitentiary street behind the forward Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality after it turned out that he was called the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kirangen seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiranden is interested in getting into Glasgow's "flooring restaurant shop".
"The Sea belongs to us": Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Matrosen patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz decorated with tauwork.
A sea blue flag blows on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, fleet support points have the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
It is a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century in Chile is as lively as the desire to re-run the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will follow the IGH ruling on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate over sovereign access to the sea of Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year is facing a controversial struggle for his re-election, much is also at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would make little change.
The UN Organisation, based in the Netherlands, is not empowered to address Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Mr Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the fact that the decision of the IGH was already available six months after the final plea is that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales' military rhetoric has embezzled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged any ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the decision of the court had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139-year disputes for the mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the sea as a political crunch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if she cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement in action the promises made during a summit between the heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be in favour more than three months after the summit with North Korea's head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore to reintroduce the hard-hitting nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the US against a declaration to end the Korea War would ever force the North into the knee as "heir-spinned."
Washington is skeptical and does not wish to accept the declaration without Pjöngjang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngjang means it seriously with the abandonment of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjöngjang for the next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy head covers for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
This summer, Instagram has flooded out of the imprecise hats, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
Other superdimensional accessories were shown with jewels of water melons, a magic hat and even an pineapple. However, these are not intended to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were covered with sewn lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimetres wide edge, all bearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpleasant hat, which struck big waves in the social media, sent another big creation over the runway: a beach bag of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a swim suit that held the bag.
At the Paris fashion week, the bast bag in red orange with bast francs and a white leather heel was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera".
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I am thinking that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for overdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages for world citizens is essential
Scotland's independent schools are still characterized by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector, which can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year show that languages with the highest existence rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages scored A in the higher exams.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin scored A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students who learned German scored A 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered electoral subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers mentioned for the problems in occupying open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open places require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically take advantage of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, with a view to 2020, will be considered the most important language for the United Kingdom, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child are, in independent schools, a number of languages with specialised teachers will always be chosen.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may be.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il sucks bee faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting soon has an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the previous season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, are not yet clear.
"There will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James will probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after training for his plans for the six-game long-term season plan of the Lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trumps rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a number of elections.
This is the first rally planned by Trump's five for the next week, including in his benevolent places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the Vacance at Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republican risks losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday September 29, 2018, 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Kavanaugh Board nominated for the Supreme Court to accusations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains in silence for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this rally series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies will serve next week to 'mobilize volunteers and followers while Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives'.
"Government control is so important for his plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational election season is approaching," said a Trump election speaker who did not want to call his name, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could participate in "Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh".
The Saturday visit is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA's team shows a willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
As a sports concept, the swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and that is especially true in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now it's four, so I think this means a little momentum for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, in the vanguard and lies four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel a little wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was eeriely strong from the deposits to the greenery and progresses with good example.
In the course of his round, the well-tural exhilarations became louder when he sunk an important coup to decide for himself the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had left behind after two holes with two points.
His sweater, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that made the American team not yet out of the game.
"I really have to knelt in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
In the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the nine rear holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly moving energy between them and the out of print support that they are the players it is about to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who will seal a possible European victory at the fall of the sun over Le Golf National.
And preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia, the front hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into a terminal that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the terminal.
The quadruple and quadruple pairs are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this four-story round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in leadership
After the fours and four parties from Saturday to the US, Europe is on the front with 10:6 and will take a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the difficult Tiger Woods and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to win back the lost trophy two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not recover the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve on Sundays to keep the trophy.
As the first European newcomer, Fleetwood won four points in a row, while Molinari and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of "Molliwood", won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourties, they were outstanding in harmony and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance occasionally flashed, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and four parties and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning, returned and played the fourer parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2–1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, there was not everything on this pleasantly windy day southwest of Paris according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2–11 victory over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-parties 4&3, after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the single with a residue of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk's team, it is a difference to keep the trophy.
After they've been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust with the United States and under these circumstances would by no means abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that last year North Korea had "taked substantial measures out of its will". For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket testing, removed the nuclear testing site and committed not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see any response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a ‘phase-wise’ approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject a unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pjöngjang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. Kim had assured him to work on the "denucleation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korea war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes demands for a reduction of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denucleization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by compulsion and even oppose the "Declaration of the End of War," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knee is a brain-spint of those who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had emphasized to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party to the Denuclearization question instead of the United States, it would not have come to this halt in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
Nevertheless, the sound of Ris spoke enormously differed from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea rockets, after "the evil President" Trump Kim had described it as a "brakeman" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "full destruction" of North Korea last year, was praising Kim at the United Nations for his courage to step up disarmament. However, he said that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – he doesn't play a role."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be pursued energetically until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea to dry out Pjöngjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes financially.
Pompeo met with Ri on the brink of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngjang, he said that progress had been made just to be accused of North Korea for hours later, he had made "guest-like demands".
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the 'appropriate measures' sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in basic studies this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture, keeping awake with caffeine and learning all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the end a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only now learning about it in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course that took place for the first time this year explained how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students were under heavy sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section the students see the image of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporty performance and importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine with the help of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czesler.
The pride in shifting a "night shift" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever growing pressure on students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
In addition to ensuring adequate sleep, the 'secret weapon' of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided as sleep withdrawals put the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czesler to design the course. Last year he had completed one of his courses in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czesler's recommendation, students should set themselves a alarm clock for the sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" which is derived from electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems while sleeping.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor beats Gerrards players
The Rangers lost another outing game, when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's disagreeable team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first outward victory at St. Johnny since the 4:1 triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was eight points behind the Hearts leading by far in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the inspired low rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian behind the goal difference.
The Rangers also threatens other troubles, after liner Calum Spence had to be treated because of a head wound by a seemingly thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overcame Ayr and reached the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took a score last week, and would have to be excited how his well-trained team kept their opponent on step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
After only two minutes, you should have scored a goal when Menga's first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgov could only shoot past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third, their game was more hopeful than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour, he should have received a penalty due to a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not let the Colombian complaints apply.
The Rangers arrive only two goal shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox tortoise Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit might not match the game in the 34th minute, it is not to deny that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted half-time and traded Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the winger placed Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced from his line ahead to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to encourage guests to play exactly the game that lies to them, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and turned off Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
Rangers replacement player Glenn Middleton also later demanded a punishment for a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: on 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely, I hear a bang!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at detarte cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerated cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect detarized cells as part of treatment.
The method is used to extract immune cells that are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can 'see' a lot of cancers common protein and then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect detarized cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, the patient is taken from immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Afterwards, the cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "produces the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken out of immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat leukaemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a Pro-Trump Tirade and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't run well.
Kanye West was mined at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had praised US President Donald Trump for a long time and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", while wearing a make-American-great-again cap, he continued with a chimpf canonade against the democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges of sexual harassment imposed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of Western Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear that Rock wanted to make fun of the release about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head cover.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said “do not go out with the cap”.
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunk area," he said, according to the Washington examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said, "He'll put on my superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
At least twice, his remarks were dislodged from the audience, and SNL participants were embarrassingly touched, said Variety. One person said the magazine: "It was dead still in the studio."
West had been committed to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love It", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the director of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANKE, THAT YOU DON'T PROVIDED THE MASS."
But the talk show host Karen Hunter Twittered that West was just him himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes up an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of himself (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The Being officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg carried the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince changed the late music legend, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (the previously known artist as Prince).

The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling like having to be strong in order to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also a member of the Game of Thrones, 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was very important to him.
"I personally think the question is very important, what has gone wrong with masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught adult men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives young people the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
For there is clearly something wrong with the young men."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer. He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be shown in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that for him the best thing had been "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife on this mission, so I have thus received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the award-winning Ygritte Fantasy Series, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
They married Leslies in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
On the basis of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex relations with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to insufficient protection in these relationships in the field of sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has, among other things, promised general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have been able to scan the data of the GOP senators, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The democrat from Los Angeles felt that the claims of "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites would be spread.
"Living, lying and even more abominable lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the consultation of a Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual infractions brought against the Supreme Court candidate Board Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government quarter.
The publication took place after the three Senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of contributions was Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for sending this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press officer.
"This dementi is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be distraught.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and relaxed."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh who was accused of being annoyed by critics during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joined the mid-term elections to release water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if that is true," he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my staff".
Criticism of "Johnny English – You live only three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to be true of this revival of the "Johnny English" action comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spoon, who finished it" and revitalised in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now quite".
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, as obviously stupid we are, become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the gloating, Grimass cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent, who thought he was cool and world-wide, while in reality he was made up of some clouseau, a prince Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Victor" at the 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind leaving travellers and international secret agents who played Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor and tying the rotor blades to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comics occurs, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the 'serious' film series such as '007' and 'Mission Imposible' now offer self-assured comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mishaps are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent filmmaggs in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Great Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the failure of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and pressured figure, who is already standing before the complete collapse due to her political indifference: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Tresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much to work with.
Her intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies have been de-arranged and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher on a sleek establishment but unofficially teaching in working as an undercover agent. There are a few Gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who, in the secret service of your Majesty, always make everything terrible wrong, are back in action. They encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatala Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is running dangerously into the banner of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of the grotesque Späße: As a waiter dressed they put a chic French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English solves pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Voltas House using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
It's a very soft substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry be a part of Rowan Atkinson's real talent?"
Labour argues to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party's intention is to report that business leaders will pass on the savings generated by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) to employees in the form of an additional free day.
The employees would have had a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
Sources say 'fits' the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The changeover to a four-day week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive check is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the launch of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party at all.
One speaker from the Labour Party said: "In a 4-day week, this is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonymous directors' and 'profit makers' at public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not hold back their entire share, as a Labour government could carry out "deductions" due to alleged misbehavior.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees in the Boards of Companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private companies to employees, cashing the annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican Senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minute correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could bring something to light, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I told in the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was issued, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and irresponsible."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been mutilated in stone.
"My opinion is clear as to board Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this vehement," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
There are now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty during this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival this year for the 7th time, in order not only to experience the appearances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poetty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea to put a cool free concert in view, a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called Clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizens announced that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or collected by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, so far the funds secured have direct effects on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership between investors and implementing fathers based in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars in fighting malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, announced to the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions with which the UK was asked to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be present at this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington is able to resort to the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, said US Minister Ryan Zince.
Zince claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zince turned to the participants in the consumer energy alliance event, a non-profit group, which is known as the "vote of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were virtually identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while calling Russia "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to extend the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unmeasured" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has stressed several times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has asked the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," says BDI Dieter Kempf's Board of Directors following a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to 'exaggerate' a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'exaggerate' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is directing this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely worried about Donald Trump's dealings with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren did not take a hand in her mouth.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI study is, of course, necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren elections do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts reported that the Senator should not be able to do so.
32 percent of voters supported such candidates.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick; 38 percent who advocated a potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed.
Among the other names of prominent democrats, who are eligible for a possible candidate for 2020, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on the Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic stress disorder, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through is what he's going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who sense the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds our soldiers have with which to return," she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as 'Elephant in space' and said about her son and other war veterans that they changed their return, that they return to the ground, that they should come back and ask themselves if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other military member has given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with a woman for domestic violence, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support an appeal to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy that refuses victims of gang activities or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District filed a court-in-law declaration in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who questions politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace counter-session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics was not announced.
She announced that her partner, "and his violent gang sons", abused her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have to fight with big problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US Asyl Policy launched a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, the Advocate General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy 'Ignores decades of legislation at the state, state and international level'.
"The Bundesgesetz requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle," was stated in the Court's Statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse to access the country had an adverse effect on the economy in the US, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workers.
In June, the Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigrants who fled from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
"Asyl exists for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or out of fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan by granting asylum to remove all problems, even all the serious problems people have to struggle with every day of the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race is doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her little fevering son in a rescue centre in the destroyed city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their perplexed possessions and wealth while storing everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a vortex and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated in the outdoors due to the persistent severe posterity.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“It all went much too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then it was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador sues China with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper filed a four-sided advertisement in an American daily newspaper that announced the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China, the U.S. ambassadors in China accused Beijing of exploiting the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6th, an accusation against China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections are in line with the U.S. officials' communication to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a wide-ranging trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa, who is exporting agricultural products to China, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a position in Des Moine's Sunday registry, now doubles this tyranny by placing propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the USA.
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government claims that the American tradition of freedom of expression and independent press by switching paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to this, you will find only a limited number of votes against here in Beijing and will not find any real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans predict voters before the intermediate elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend candidates for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh Board, in the face of multiple accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, which in particular could be caused by women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
"Such things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute proposal for an FBI investigation was sufficient to address an angry voters.
"Women do not forget what was yesterday, they do not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the valley area of the Senate called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaughs and that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don't like the president, often don't choose."
Even before Ford’s public statement that her accusations of the sexual attack against the Supreme Court candidates are presented in detail, observers indicated that an counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a dire mess for the GOP," said NBC News at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"It is not only about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of democrats, the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or probably Kavanaugh's faith.
38% further claimed that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
According to the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford issued an affidavit in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her study time in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who accesss which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best chance that the intention behind Inrupt was the “world domination”.
"We need to become active now," he said on startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate areas.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide on his own who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a IBM-acquired security platform is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models will be completely remodelled overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based webs.
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 because of his commitment to the attack on Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons exposed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under violent fire of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he moved forward to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest taperness" before running forward with a field weapon in the single entrance and removing three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never live up to, and at the same time something that makes a humble one become.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he made a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero will be visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
San Jose's bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audiences in the United Kingdom were not amazed when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until the early morning hours to see the fight specifically.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the cartoon character as a somehow bad joke.
"Because of government regulations, these contents are classified as not youth-free, so that at 6 a.m. they had to be changed to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Executive Board at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the Company will work on the timetable to take into account UK viewers in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved already during the replay," he said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning, on a Sunday, with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday’s local time there.
But we'll stay there.
There was quite a lot of communication at the changeover. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that it is a technical disorder.
What was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case. And we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels down on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subject to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the victory at the Olympic Games is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In Laverne's first broadcast, he said that he used to view himself as inferior compared to others, since the love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: "Today is the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others, the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this subject because he was fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to make others brave.
The triple world champion fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a youth – he participated for the first time in the Olympic Games with 14 and his father died three years later in cancer, it is difficult to find someone with similar experiences at the same age.
The couple have had a son since June who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year everything would have turned around gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic Gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked for was the London 2012 tickets, because he wanted to be there in the front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that became finally clear that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games in front of the local audience – that was crazy," he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still provided geese skin.

Mickelson, currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must make a great effort not to make it a debacle.
Mikkelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bench for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturdays by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as usual, the five-fold major winner spent his day in arousing others and working at his game, hoping to correct the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined together with Tommy Fleetwood, newman at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start at the 12 singles with four points behind, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk spoke confidently to Mickelson and couldn't add much to that either.
"He was perfectly aware of his current role, gave me a clap on my back, and put his arm around me, and said he's ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went now and that's what we expected.
Like everyone else, he wants to be there."
Mikkelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games held on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway, which never completely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mikkelson can record 18 wins, had to insert 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can be over soon with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage leading to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only just came across the finish line and in the lead with the smallest lead and won a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The idea remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the victory of 5–3 of the 2018 Class of both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the dots are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I have always said it, I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance his players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overwhelm it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual achievements are in the foreground and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things run well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested as golfers up to the limits of his abilities.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of it."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart to Jim Furyk will ensure that his players cut off better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the side of the winner before he was on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wunder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task to get to the counter-beat, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
"I chose the boys in this order, because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his choice of events.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships that came into the years of the Cold War. However, according to local media, it will only be delivered early next year due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the pilot ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Wuerttemberg" class, was now shifted to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service already in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to contain a high-performance cannon, a series of flight defence missiles and marine target aircraft as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the already obsolete state of the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is to represent as a maritime power at the time of its commissioning, according to Time.
Last year, Fregatte F125 followed the accident when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to Hamburg by the shipyard Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant 'software and hardware errors' that would have made the new ship unusable in a situation of conflict.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too difficult, which leads to a loss of performance and prevents the Navy from carrying out retrofitting measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of 'Rheinland-Pfalz' was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, have become a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest people are particularly important given the recent warnings that the power of the sea is shrinking in Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's commander, confirmed that the Navy "is going out of operational ships".
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken off the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
In a estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to demonstrate how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to lead future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as the brown long ear and bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and determines what species is doing.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the stocks of bats in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have decreased significantly.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also present a risk, as can flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts carrying out regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the three-way industry in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Gutswalter David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threat we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there is much we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these works, which will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel at ease."
He stressed the importance of excluding first from the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and erase the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish civil servant of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and with many of our species we do not know what their populations are all about."
Ronaldo argues for rape while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, against him, referred to rape accusations as "Fake News" and said that by using his name, people want to "be famous".
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine The mirror that published the accusations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence for the incident, so Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror due to the accusations they, according to Reuters, referred to as 'unauthorised reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy'.
Lawyers Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damages at a level corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident should have occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he had recently raped them with documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga asserts that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was '99 percent a good guy', who was second to the 'one percent'.
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was agreed.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had "angst voor retribution" and was concerned about being "published publicly".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to stop the agreement because she was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and changed this summer to the Italian Giant Juve in a 100 million euros deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “rejoice” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "rejoice forever" if, according to Brexit, it lost its status as a world leader in cars, said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued that it was "suppressive" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production in the Burnaston plant at Derby's should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border could lead to job losses in a No-Deal-Brext.
The plant in Burnston, where Toyotas produces product lines Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at the end of March in an uncontrolled Brexit," says Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close his mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are supplied every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interruptions at the borders that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to carry on a warehouse in Derbyshire that lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us, like I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest official of the Unite trade union at work, stated that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never brings these jobs back once they are gone.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week", while the dispute over candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was held on Sunday in the White House.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of the Special Mediator Robert Mueller, who has examined the electoral interferences by Russia, links between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as a possible prevention of justice by the President.
The question whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump as well as the President's appointment with the help of the 25th additional constitution.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid being collided with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going ahead with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held any press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie at an aversion to the "effect-hashing" of the TV reporter, but admitted: "I would not deny that they operate effect-hashing."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President made more question-and-answer rounds than every President in front of him," she said, without making precise evidence: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, according to Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly questions to the President of the United States, it will be far better than to speak to me.
We've been trying to do this frequently, and you've seen that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and that's what the press conference's place will take if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case when he made a show running out of the row and sometimes bizarre before assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressed to persons from the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the UK left.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself ready to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations were continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, thereby benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very pleased if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, said that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a support and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the office at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the type or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved over from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, which increased his total number to 18 Tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher tax on real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom in the future. The additional revenue will benefit homeless persons according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step is intended to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase of the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, benefiting the more income homeless.
This step is an attempt to reduce Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and take top earners into the visor.
The increase in the tax on stamps is applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and should be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase on second-hand housing and the rent of residential property introduced two years ago, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is calculated by taking additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built property in London is purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom. This increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to walk in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, became 'spirit cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has declared himself to be a reduction in the tax on stamps in order to enable more young people to become the first home.
He accused construction companies of raising real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's 'living shame'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to banning spaces without a reasonable reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May stated: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life should be improved from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it can't be right that it's just as easy for people who don't live in the UK as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far away for too many people, and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his “largest goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Schotte enjoys the challenge of bringing the club out of the North East England's new life, which is just on the third place in League One and is not at the top of the three points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to get to the bank and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's sports sound.
“But as a child, I often saw Scotland playing in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I had been successful in club management."
Ross predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club, after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this association, he is without a doubt part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd only count my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can have a management career of only three years, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real split path," he remembered when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny, as I didn't hurt myself, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this with regard to the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I have always wanted to manage and now I do it. I have never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heat wave in summer has lost the revenue of UK crisising pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Public and cash companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who composed the figures, stated: “Refering sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the football world, meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which pubs were able to record sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, it was even more difficult to find a restaurant.
The decline of 1.8 percent of the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that rose higher than it did at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant owners.
It seems like people just wanted to go out on a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while sales of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected that the temperate temperatures will provide the much-needed breathing break in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand-rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the public, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized sector benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The news fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students reported having a 'main account' to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a reference to the Photo Sharing website Instagram.
The news fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" that they could show their parents but also own private accounts.
One mother, who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager, the other asked me to rape.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headlesses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'vote of athletes' in the Scottish Sports Council
At its annual General Assembly, Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member to the Council of Scottish athletics Association Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Light athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice of athletes, hoping that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland."
The American who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, mentions a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say whether or not I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compare mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement on the net with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
The manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers in order to launch the 'first low-noise-noise milk pump' according to its own specification.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: "Yes, I'm milking me, but you don't see me a cock" or "if you didn't notice it, these aren't udders but my breasts."
In the refrain it goes on to say: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came up with mixed reactions from the viewers, many of whom say that it is impoverished by the "frights" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Just as we do, they have to be gnawed and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away from them within a few days after birth," said one comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Receivable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'Such a reality-free advertising'.
Others defended advertising and one woman admitted that you found the song "Urkomisch".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: 'This is a funny advertising that is directed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like cows'.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women using milk pumps pretend to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all associated challenges and at the same time, in an entertaining and comprehensible way, to present the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the Catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants were quietly brought to a tent city on the Texan border
The number of internal migrants is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it harder to accommodate children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become the target of an expulsion even when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the Customs Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the authority arrested people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners did not have any previous entries in the criminal record.
“As many as 80 percent of those who are either self-employed or a member of a caretaker’s household stay illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are impunity foreigners.
That's why we're going to keep following these people," says Albumence.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that, according to employees of accommodation in some children, require to appear within one month instead of 60 days after the detention before court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video circuitry and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of a negative decision, the person shall be quickly relocated.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is to be, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have become known in the system last month that they are scared and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo, because there are signs that a child has problems, given the size is easier to overlook.
They also explained that traumas that many of the children already suffer can be strengthened if they are brought to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘arming forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally committed and "treated accordingly" with the pretext of the fight against terrorism.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360.000 people have died and millions more people have been expelled from their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are clean', both from terrorist groups and 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
As regards the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given, and he accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fears" of stopping refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow their return home," he said.
'They are politicalizing a purely humanitarian matter'.
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last big rebel high castle Idlib represents the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front bound by Al-Qaeda, will be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that his work should be limited to the "reform of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, end an official dissent or a scandal's presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there are no signs that the spectators were satisfied.
Since 2014, CNN's input rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million more than in 2014 and have almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of broadcast, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the switching-on rates to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"That's like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on the TV broadcast "Bacino" about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said “because he makes me laugh”” to me, Scovell told me.
The chaos has a great entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the basic decision on abortions, Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
The turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is going to be an informed citizen if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round, which over Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from Straußenleder (according to Washington Post, a "a dress of self-examination") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's tearful description of Trump's, um, anatomy discussed.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show that he represents every evening," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily actions (break a fight with the football league NFL from the fence, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a episode, or you won't come with me anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees before his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and looked MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He just couldn't solve himself from the screen, not if Richter Brett Kavanaugh was just about to testify to the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy broadcasts at the time and the people said “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donation funds were the closest races to sit in the congress during the mid-elections
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly established boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two officers standing around the same seat in the race.
The recently-signed suburbs in Pittsburg allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to take up his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb goes against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapd with the new 17th district.
The cards were repainted after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were broken against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a strike-off between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a well-respected special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won with 20 percentage points advantage.
Politexperts are giving the democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without reaching out to great resistance from Washington.
Trump made a friendly meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partner threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the US Foreign Ministry have decided to withdraw the heads of all American representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to 'the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was criminal measures considered, which in 2017 received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid services, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now provided as a spokesman at the conference held in mid-October in order to provide diplomats with a sign of the importance given by the government of the assembly.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silently and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new scrapping or criminal measures from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to express themselves to the internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learning From History
The next big surprise could be the report by the special intermediary Robert Mueller on Trump's possible prevention of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now also alleged to investigate whether Trump's campaign team with Russia has designed to attack the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump faced an organ that forces him to be accountable, precisely at the time when he passes by to step back in front of the voters; and possibly in front of a jury of experts.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the struggle will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We have failed, and a possibility to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the incessant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisss Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein came to Devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and speculated about being unfit for the office.
Rosenstein demented the presentation of the New York Times.
"How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Board Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and misstatement?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to fire Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans by the Rangers optimistically before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain, a victory against the Austrians will move them into a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League at the beginning of the month.
Because of a knee injury, Graham Dorrans couldn't appear up to the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for Greater.
"This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could make something out of it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but overall a difference was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a heavy match because they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of old age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to your spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of her, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Take action at the last minute.
Create a precautionary power so that you order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Consider also an authority for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medical treatment?"
Who cares about the dog?
Have already completed this plan."
Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the belly and the hand.
Officials described the shots that took place around 02:30 British times as 'willful deed'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of dead is expected to rise.
Because of the unusual communication systems, relief forces were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength of 7.5.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city had just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal section of more than 300 km (180 miles).
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived in 2017 estimated 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the economy of Central Sulawesis, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Mrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia lies on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December that met 14 countries and cost 226,000 people living in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, of which almost half was in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a strength of 7.6 met the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozen villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok popular among tourists and demanded more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor Alaska and former Vice President's office, was arrested for accusations of physical injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the obstacle to the reporting of domestic violence, and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a friend when he wanted to tell the police.
Palin, according to the TUU, is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, absolutely certain," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A illegal offences, which can be demanded with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also burdened with an illegality of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
It's not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability from the reporting of a crime and arms possession under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after returning her son's behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a thickness of 7,5 solved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and it is assumed that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Bundesanwaltship demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecution in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfulllo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he raced along a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed the eight ovens "targeted" and "consciously" committed serious physical injuries, so it is stated in the statement of intent for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could, according to the court document, be punished with death.
Weeks after the attack, a Bundesversuchungsschwurgericht Saipov filed an indictment letter in 22 points containing eight charges of the murder against the background of organised crime, which are normally used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'basic planning and purpose', according to the prosecutors who described the kind in which Saipov carried out the act as 'abominable, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Herrend Ferruchi, Herren Run Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco Damage, pain and loss," said the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has not been pursuing a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifetime imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who two years earlier had been guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He pretended before investigators to feel good about what he did, so the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also demanded that ISIS's flag hang up in his hospital room.
He declared himself guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "of course disappointed" because of the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only extend the trauma that all parties suffer in the event of a debt in exchange for a lifelong imprisonment without the possibility of dismissal," says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party Member calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the power of the people" during a protest operation within the framework of the Tories Conference.
The former leader of Ukip stated that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's Party suggested that Farage should conduct negotiations with the EU.
Conservative hinterman Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit Minister, the United Kingdom would be "ready out".
The challenge that May faces in reconciliation of its deeply disbanded parts was aggravated by the fact that members of your party, who are in the EU, took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Ally insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the "Chaos".
At the "Leave Means Leave" demonstration in Solihull, Bone stated that "Chequers belong to the garbage".
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed to a peer and entrusted him with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would already be outside," he explained.
The member of Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is part of the garbage.”
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in World War I to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion had changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and said to reporters: 'I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unloved in our own party and with our activists who actually pass through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
She continued in a key message on May: ‘Primeary ministers will keep their jobs if they keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure,” they should be right about cheating on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage says.
“They are trying to deceive Brexit, and that is why we are here today to tell them, “You are not coming from it”.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which has helped us victory in the referendum and will never come to rest until we are not independent, self-managementing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists swung banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, exist for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” says Adonis.
"This is a Farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘exaggerately’ the Presidency’
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November she would be "examining the presidential candidate closely".
The Boston Globe reports that the democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican MP in the parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's arrival.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. in the morning.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday and asked to help identify the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury in the head and died as a result of this injury," said the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to be at the scene and owned by a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and held in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter-large Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes Stallorder would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as if he was performing Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a short wheel-in-wheel maneuver, where the Ferrari pilot involuntarily freed the inside side of it with the risk of two movements in order to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in place seven.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and to take Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round to the box and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri performed excellent throughout the weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was going to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of a campaign event on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted not to have passed on to the press the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he submits sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court Board of Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement was not addressed directly to the Senate’s Justice Committee but commented that the processes in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," says the President.
“If you look at the leaks and then you say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
The letter was played with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein, according to The Hill, to the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I answered her request for secrecy."
Her Dementi did not seem to be well with the president who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In its continuous defense of the judge candidate who is accused of sexual attacks by three women, the Democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care who is hurting them when they get put under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the backgame in Dundee on Saturday again.
The Giants went in the lead early with two goals, after matches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer recovered the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was similar to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth round of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaulll. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the tour.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to play after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to compensate his gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of the Giants before the mid-term break when he reached his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team was new and Bouchard started out again with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee in the game for the first time late in the second half of the game. Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth goal after just half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at their home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controllers died after he was sure that hundreds of people in an aircraft escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong posters are still felt in the region and many people are caught in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly varying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safe.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling in.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country's civil protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the ruins, while others cannot be reached," said the spokesperson of the authority Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
That's a tragedy now, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and declared in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks that go with the evacuation.
Since you were ready?" said CNN.
This year, Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports about a missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing, after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact course of the accident continued to be unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through heavy water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking aircraft.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors working near the improvement of a mooring station rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found to indicate that 111 people died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night when a woman was burned alive
The charge ended on Saturday in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers, where he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "that my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis agreed to have known Chambers at their time of death for two weeks.
But phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost some time after Chamber's death of their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He has removed them from his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin their pleaters on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then proceed before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has removed itself from its roots of political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make again socially conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common experienced a renaissance by artists such as Akala and Lowkey in recent times in the United Kingdom.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sued couple for a release after 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misguided message from the mother in which he complained that she was still 'black'.
The couple argued to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'expression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new daily mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEEEEEIN, NOW A SWARZE,' Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Twice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the "peelly touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice dismissed and claimed that the open African daily mother had done a bad job and instead expected a Filipino, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the release and claims compensation for the 350 dollars a day, which she should take over six months for which the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, had been booked and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, that's not what you do," she said to the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple rejected the racism proposals, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared that Maurice could no longer be trusted after they insulted them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want such a person’s interests?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the legal dispute continues, the couple were quickly sentenced to the public and accused of the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, had his work been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the release after his death was "bitter sweet" last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she described as "very important family member."
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who did something special: you’re proud, even though it wasn’t really your own achievement.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like this.
Although he invented and created him, Padington himself was always responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After the country, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that doctors gave her little opportunities," says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart at the pump sound slowly and left her body.
She had just died and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who didn't get any of what she was going through, went on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives through a suicide seek to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, stated that her son was in a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Each one knew him for his smile.
They all said that his smile could brighten up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, who had been with her for 15 years, shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom. When the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma to her, but that had to go through it: "It's taking a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future in the swap while the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought if we could actually get something like that he asked for, so a time-limited investigation, maybe we could get some agreement," said Flake on Saturday. He fears that the Committee would "break apart" in the party political stand.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their will can be traced back to timing alone.
The interim elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans were to cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone receiver to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on equality of vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overruns “sink” under Kim
The number of North Korean cross-borders to South Korea has been falling in power seven years ago since Kim Jong-un, said a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overruns were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as major factors.
Pjöngjang did not speak publicly about it.
The vast majority of the passers-by from the north is finally offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korea War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the cross-borders rather than illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in the war state, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pjöngjang to talk about the denucleization negotiations that were held.
As a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, they agreed to work on a denucleized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Unless we can trust the US, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first one-sided," said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls board Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says that he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Nancy Pelosi's office called the Kavanaugh judge's board "hysterical" and said that he was characterarily inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted in this way had been described as 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh deduced in an emotional way all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and was about to break out in tears when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a 'great and coordinated murder' organized by Liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, as they showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he came over the Clintons and the Democrats, he has even declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial posts," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat she was concerned about possible decisions against Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or of the abortion decision Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-conceived person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ach is not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere speech of hatred, months and years of overcooking anger and it does not get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She added: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that she also wept when she was angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, she says to the person to whom she said: “They may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found the brilliant."
Tears are permitted as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstandingd.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was pulled into a stairwell by an older woman, an undercooled manager, who was always a little afraid of me.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re a sniff.
They believe that you are sad and will be content with themselves, as they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a convention member from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business at an extramarital affair and then left his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well-concerned decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “snowvitts and the seven dwarfs”.
As the electoral struggle was already advanced, it lay behind the funding, and she vowed not to run if she did not get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they believe I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so difficult from her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the middle purchase and direct address of the voters instead of the delegates, as well as anger over sexism, so overwhelmed that she was close to tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they might write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the USA and China
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when he filed fines on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new criminal duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Every time Beijing hit back in the same way, he recently raised criminal duties of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China vowed to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon fail.
Moveing Washington to direct would mean yielding. However, a public downturn to the US would be far too scornful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have recognized before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia in the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the land destroyed by the war that lasts for seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure," he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions were now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday life and living conditions.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed help in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that there would be no conditions for aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe succeeded in winning the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points that it needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with much of the tournament, sank off the 16th Railway (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of four players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in his current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t cry by default, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes on to give the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the single encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've been watching on television since my childhood," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance from 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had problems finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the boys they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Take off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a good job.
We'll be regrouping, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
