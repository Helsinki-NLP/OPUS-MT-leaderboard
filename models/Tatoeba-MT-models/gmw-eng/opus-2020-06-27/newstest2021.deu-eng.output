Biker reacts fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Kraftolsheim and Merklingen, where a motorbike driver was slightly injured thanks to his rapid reaction.
Car driver overlooking biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left to the Landesstraße in 1230 towards Kraftolsheim around 21.30 with her VW from Merklingen.
In doing so, she passed the 24-year-old motor driver from Nellingen.
At the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but it was in the rear of the car.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake lever were demolished at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to stop.
At the present time he controlled his motorcycle in the green rods next to the lane and let it roll out there without falling into the trap.
Biker Suffers Leg Injury
Because of the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury at the time and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavaria Mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and no longer allowed to leave the plant.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were tested positively in the series investigation on the corona-coV-2 pathogen, as the Landratamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that builds strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - the cucumbers but only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "Our information is a closed circle of persons".
In the courtyard, infected persons were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPDs gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition fractions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitter when such local infectious events arise and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Korona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at work and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came with an announcement.
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls to Schubser in the Gleisbett
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and plunged into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station around 16.15 am.
A passerby alarmed the police who touched with several stripes.
According to first investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man went across the platform and fell into the rail bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-olds helped to climb the crash from the track.
There was no danger caused by an invading track.
The police reported that there was a conflict between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled from the crime scene at first, but his personnel could be determined in retrospect.
In company with his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-olds are identified for physical injury.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer stock data storage
Stock data storage is currently exposed.
However, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of State Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended stocking data storage report - instead of the ten weeks planned for half a year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a rapid change of law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense "to make necessary adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
At present, stock data storage is exposed.
A decision of the ECJ is expected to do so.
But Seehofer wants the changes before so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out for stock data storage in June.
NBA: Strip club noise for Clippers star Lou Williams
Exciting the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quartier in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN specifications, is back in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
At present, the best 22 teams are preparing with training games on the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the Corona location
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a drug additive for large farms.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau district has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvest workers are currently working from several countries, over a third have infected themselves with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a bauzaun.
Nobody's allowed to leave the premises, food supplies are delivered.
The local authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well 3300 inhabitants of the community.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Conscientious bite": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself in cooperation," said the newspaper's lawyer Quentin Chabert.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "spoiled by conscience and taken very much with him the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor's office, the man threatens ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire at night on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who was now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent invasion into the church, he quickly got into the field of view of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former President of the DFB Reinhard Grindel recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel der "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs that can become most dangerous Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether or not it is necessary for clubs wishing to break into this Phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors".
However, he had doubts as to whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
"There remains a legal risk of investing fences in a European internal market to attract the business location of Bundesliga," Grindel said.
The former DFB CEO sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and have passed through to the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've already been very busy with that."
The gift worth around 11,000 euros he had received from an Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch present, I have handled completely transparent and mischievous.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a heel out of the present," assured the 58-year-old.
"That might be called naïve, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead man
The protests against police violence in the United States have again intensified by Donald Trump's use of federal politicians in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed a crossing.
Previously, in Portland, protests against racism and police violence were once again in conflict.
The security forces, including officials from the federal police, set up tear gas during the night to Saturday and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds, sometimes armed demonstrators marched through Louisville on Saturday in Kentucky and demanded that the people responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held responsible.
The 26-year-old student was shot in March at a drug rape in her home in Louisville.
The goal of the Razzia was someone else who didn't live there, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, when a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans gave off a shot, three people were injured.
According to the NBC station, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were floating in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because there were also area protesters formed by a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In the Texan Austin, a person was shot and died in the course of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police, according to their own information, carried a suspect in custody.
More detailed information about the circumstances of the act did not make them so far.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, announced that he was like many in the city, "satisfied and unconsuming" because of what had happened.
In the American metropolis Seattle, demonstrators met the police on Saturday.
They set fire in front of a youth prison construction car, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or physical injury.
A court building was set in fire in Oakland City in California.
A small group of demonstrators hit windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, informed Oakland's police on the late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could quickly be erased again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was taken to the hospital.
In addition, windows were also struck in a court window and a fire was laid, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes definate Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy-Fest.
But: Even if the big party mile was missing in the city center, which burns masses and program heights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or fortification, many came at their expense at the Corona compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy's flair," says Kur Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, as well as the historical ones alone were in the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time also in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable on the Luitpold casino, watched the historical ones flirting and listened to the Cuban live music at the playbench restaurant.
"I like it so much," says Konhäuser.
They don't miss the masses that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program heights, first and foremost Saale burns on Friday evenings as well as the historic fortress and the final fireworks on Sunday evenings.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy exitr should take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
Some for Christina Gold, who plays on the fortress in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was traveling in costumes on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"This is already more demanding, otherwise we have it easier," she says.
The Riderverein had less to do, even though individual riders were travelling in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider's quadrilles will be allowed to take place again in the coming year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy rider will again take place.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second-legist Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football team CF Fuenlabrada is slittering deeper into the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from nearby Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña despite the first Corona events on 20 July, a low impact follows the next one.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid has so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office determined because of a possible criminal offence against public health, the top sports authority CSD considered the forced descent of the club.
Players as well as other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of the quarantine, they didn't get fresh towel and no gel," the sports newspaper "AS".
On photos you can see how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they had apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was eating.
Neither was it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, informed that the hotel was satisfied.
The allegation that public health was deliberately at risk was rejected by the lawyer of the club, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the President of the Primera Division, Javier Tebas, was not opposed to the Corona rules established by the Football Association, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before departure, there were four infected people until 19 July, but all of them had been isolated and had not come along.
Right before the flight on Monday to A Coruña, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, there would have been positive team members with "five or six" of the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch horses torn out in steam
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a traffic operator informed two free-run horses on the door between Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and Theres motorway port.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the doorman and the village of Steamach.
After being able to gain the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, they were killed by a rope carried in the striped car.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can quite imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just laying down the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career this year before the Corona break.
During the negotiations with his team, he also said it was about the number of racing days.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, said Martin.
Before he got up after a fall, the first thought was, "Just get back on the wheel.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: what if.
The professional admitted that there are aspects with which he is becoming increasingly difficult to do.
"But it was good for me to see what I have on cycling and how much fun he is."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time-trading specialist returns to competition events.

Kovac tests Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football trainer Niko Kovac there will soon be a show with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French master will host the Hesse, the former Croat Club, on 1 August (18:00 hrs).
For the Bundesligist it is the first and only hard test before playing the European League against the FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is carried out without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sporty this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had joined the succession of the Croatian.
In March the Frankfurters had lost the eight-final game against Basel in their own stadium at 0:3.

Whole villages are under water.
Farmers have lost their harvests.
Panzers' horns in National Park die by landslides
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tanks were killed by landslides.
They are protected and present as being at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which leads scientists back to climate change.
Bangladesh, according to the United Nations, is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments stand empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the floods of displaced people.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm in Grenezn also holds.
Those who had a house earlier, it was also so small and like a cottage, often don't want to spend their lives in a large block of living.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - should soon be drawn up from those who have lost their home through the floods.

Argentina rejects counter offer by creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs informed Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in an opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of approximately 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the State Party threatens the country again.
It would be the ninth default payment in Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, adheres to its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
Inflation was more than 50 percent last.
For the current year, experts expect that economic power decreases by around 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay interest claims of US$503 million, resulting in a limited default in payment.
Professional arrival - not yet privately
"It runs super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be the successor of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running on full tours.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottalan Scorer and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time had not been enough to completely shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
At the moment she was with her husband, who worked as a judge at the local court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day of Regensburg, she also had an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring countryside, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a long term.
During visits on site with her family in the last few months, she then found that "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
All the more she was happy that she had made the race for the free place in the selection process.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home is also playing a central role in Lower Bavaria: after the law school in Passau, she completed her referendum period and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary officer, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg, at this time she also trained "nearly" the PhD in Labour Law - she took her first place in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she moved to her parents' age and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services at various notary agencies.
When the job had been written out in Eggenfelden because of the close retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the residence in the Notariatsstelle in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has just a praise for the team of the firm: "It runs super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In matters of kindergarten-respective cribs, she has already made contact with a local facility.
And everything as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled by 20 percent at the start of the season in case of a fan return.
"Thanks to the distance control that must be respected, we are planning, after a current stand, with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer, "day mirror".
Usually, the arena in the district of the Bundesliga plays a little more than 81,000 viewers.
In the ghost games of the previous season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalisation, hopes that in addition to the normal audience places, some of the 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accountant if these revenues are completely broken out".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all "good advice is currently being given to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmund Marketing Chief praised the BVB-Profess for its part-reliance, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandise on short work."
Small miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 adults who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windles specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be by voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't shout as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt Jacobus gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen Theatre presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" - per video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange themselves via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and performance.
The idea for the performance format of the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of teaching.
Even if at the end everyone agreed that the direct encounter in theatre and stage space would offer additional charms, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: the TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of Sunday.
Munich - Sixteenth possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup is established.
Lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the event of a successful qualification.
This showed the explosion on Sunday evenings in the ARD sports show.
Because of the Corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the discharge.
The TSV 1860 is already in the finale of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September) due to the voluntary absence of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen.
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Victoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-liga lifter Würzburg reach the finale, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, Giesinger would have to prevail in the final game against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus a week before the third league start.

In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherherz".
Three years later the award was awarded as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
A lot of recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dark Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the main role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece has been a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Way Song for a Body".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son of Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale bei Comeback
The two World Cups Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
In September of last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, her enthronements Ehlers/Flüggen against the surprise team Lukas Pfrechner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde had a defeat at 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfrechner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz out of AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fijnblatt"
From the point of view of the FDP, Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion from the AfD is only a "figenblatt" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Council had decided by a majority in May, on Saturday in Stuttgart.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group on the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD was really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, functionalists like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and doesn't change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many French supporters still have a right-wing extremiser in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "flügs" around the Thüringer Afd-Landes- und Gruppensförn Björn Höcke; the protection of the constitution as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not specify an earlier membership of the "Heimatreuten Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he entered the party.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
Also, the chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has eaten only Kreide.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party whether with or without calbitz".
This decision will not weaken either the federal party or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the muthene trap is perceptible.
One wants to escape further observation through constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
There is nothing to be done about this," commented the Brandenburger SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the political group still held their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he will now proceed civilly against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed electricity into the grid.
This is almost 21 percent more than during the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring the North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the network area of Tennet, have fed further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh).
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Sea comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
This accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results in addition to the wind conditions from higher production capacities because new wind farms have gone to the grid in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full force, they could generate 6,7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this and, according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore networks," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration at the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold spread the usual setting after the Korona-Puse.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtothether" became involved.
Freital: Windbergfest das Corona cancelled
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have truly not made this decision easy and, knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved, hoped for it until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Partless).
"In the end, however, we are here as organizers of the health of many thousands of people".
For if tens of thousands of people had flown to the ground and to the citadel, minimum distances, hygiene rules and a follow-up to contact could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there wouldn't have been much left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by multiples.
Rumberg comforted next year.
The city of Freital then celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7th to 9th May 2021, as well as the day of Saxony from 10th to 12th September 2021.
Dressage olympician Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start of the season with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also on Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and not to beat in the course.
On Sunday, on the 15-year-old mare gold Weihegold, Werth was significantly opposed to the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer.
On Saturday, too, the Germans lay on Quantaz clearly in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is supposed to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first shortfall ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned for 14 to 16 August.
For the future, more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule continues to ventilate: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and began in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility of enabling the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both the university and the DFS Air Safety Academy have a uniform burden on capacity utilisation.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019, represented at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training on air traffic at Worms University.
This year nine students already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and lottery training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Stiftungsprofessur is a forward-looking investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The professorship of the Foundation is an important bridge between science and business.
With her we want to connect to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's Programme Air Traffic Management."
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is motivated and committed by the University of Worms to further enhance its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In use for tomorrow's air traffic controllers, the university can place very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first professorship of the Foundation for a dual course of studies.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, stressed: "Worms University has an exclusive feature in Rhineland-Palatinate, with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter landing on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident of the rescue helicopters was in operation.
A 76-year-old drove straight in the curve with a Ford at around 12.40 p.m. on the exit Alzenau-Mitte and landed on the Leitplanke.
Through the impact, the front airbags solved, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were cared for by the emergency doctor and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
But the police are currently assuming that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be scrapped off.
Heil wants to test other industries according to meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the states back to light in parts of the meat industry.
We're just about ahead of a reform of the law.
But are they right - and will they stay with them?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors according to the strict rules now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will watch the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet on this Wednesday intends to enact a law of salvation.
In case of slaughter, decommissioning and processing of meat, large slaughterers should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel.
The purpose is to prohibit the use of contract workers and temporary workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and workers' handover if you don't want to completely waste the economy".
For example, work contracts are necessarily the basis for their value added by the customer for wide areas of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The sins of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were useful.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to set up a security facility, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers that a ban on work contracts and temporary work is unconstitutional only in its sector.
It is not possible to explain why in future, serving and packaging cheese should be subject to different labour law than for sausages, it is stated in an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In a ban, the consumer price would thus increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from work contracts worked in the industry following the results of an examination of the NRW work protection management, partly 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also established that the situation was often miserable for the accommodation of employees.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these "tricky designs" had been used.
"Now needs to be cleaned up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher check rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for community housing".
The present draft contains amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example also animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staff points are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in case of crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultra-light aircraft to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police reports.
A child had easily been injured.
Two more people had been rescued in the disaster, said one speaker from the Wesel District Guide.
A parachute had been found at the accident scene, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling on eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane crashed with a hot-air balloon.
At the house it is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not first known.
Persistence of Frankfurter Opernplatz
A week after the cries in Frankfurt, the opening of the opera court on Sunday was also peaceful.
Last but not least, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the stop.
The police had been in charge since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police station was being held throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend from midnight there was a ban on the opera court, on which it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police had been attacked out of the crowd of celebrants with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police duties, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car overslaught: Young woman injured seriously in accident at Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade sought potential drivers.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on her way to her place of residence Hümme, when her car came from the road from previously unexplained cause and crossed several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire brigade had to clear the roof of the car.
As it was unclear whether anyone was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was selected from the lathe with a thermal camera.
The Warburg Drones Staffel, which also works with thermal cameras, had also been ordered to search for persons.
However, the forces of operation did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The injured was taken to the Kassel Klinikum with the rescue car.
Almost 50 forces of fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal of Cristiano Ronaldo record champion Juventus Turin has secured itself for the ninth time in series the Italian championship.
The team around the five-time world football team made the total 36th scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at the 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to dissipate one from place two days before the end of the season of series A.
The second Inter Milan table is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half-time, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
An addition of Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old of the penal border directly used a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the more offensive guests on the 2nd, and after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This assured the glistening but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, the Foulelfmeter to the latte may only have held Ronaldo correctly even in view of the Torjäger rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Trainer Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve recently had the calming lead at the top of the table due mainly to the weakness of the competitors.
For in the eleven games before the game on Sunday the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will become a goalkeeper king is in question.
As the Portuguese superstar scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immore has already won 34 matches on his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at the Hellas Verona – as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinar scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Alte Dame" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the Champions League's Eighth Final, but on August 7th, he has to get into a 0:1 game track against Olympique Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors
Stuttgart - All threatened punishments and court judgments despite giving motorists in countless illegal races on the Baden-Wuerttemberg road continue to give gas: last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
Comparative values for the years before do not exist, but the shavers are increasingly doing work to the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The race involved less organised events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would have spontaneously attacked each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - even this is displayed as an illegal race.
At the tax, mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were sitting.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a relatively few cases are the shavers caught and also asked for the checkout: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonments have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitively than before because of the various tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequent response, said a minister.
Especially popular with shavers the highway 8. Always again and again drivers stop the traffic there in order to get space and take advantage of the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race route
On the A81, the police even register more races than any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, it is tried there to stop the shaver on the particularly affected section between tights and hostages.
The most high-priced and high-priced sports and luxury cars often have Swiss marks because the drivers avoid driving to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and authoring in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit cannot be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD-Landtag Group.
"The brake threshold for shavers would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometres and more".
Rivoir is less aware of Enlightenment or Image Campaigns: "If you want to go beyond all the rules in this way and not just put your own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users, you can't be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for more police intervention
On the other hand, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that shavers do not let themselves be dissuasive from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely becomes more painful and serious from the high-tour power measurement: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died throughout the country during the race, of which two were uninvolved during a night crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, boasted against a garden wall and remained on the side of the road, who died 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, there is no need for stricter penalties: "Legal action needs to be taken to make illegal motor race more difficult is not seen," says the Interior Ministry's paper.

Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervenes, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "Tuning meeting" on the parking space of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police put their announcement to strengthen the control of such events.
A major Tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconian Police, an increased vehicle arrival in the area of a large parking space on Ingolstädter Straße had been detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 22.30 pm.
The police there then carried out a variety of vehicle controls.
Only recently had the police announced that they would want to step up their efforts against so-called autoposer.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "Scene"
The officials were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police are taking stock.
However, only a small part of those present would be assigned to the "autoposer" and tunes scene.
It seems that most of the scenes in this regard followed the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the spot, it is likely that these were mainly eye-catching persons.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the maintenance of minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nasal protection.
The control measures carried out on-site had been completed by 11 a.m.
Overall, in 10 vehicles, the officials found such changes in construction that the operating licence had been lost.
Four of these vehicles had to be ensured.
No authors
Illegal authors didn't exist.
"The police president will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectators," he said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participating drop-off company: "They have all the beautiful rims that we cannot scratch," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this purpose.
Also because cars are broader, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
"The young people are finally supposed to hold back their cars without any damage."
Labour agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - According to the Federal Employment Agency (BA) about 900 suspected cases of abuse in the short-term labour market.
"This is extremely little for more than 88,000 companies that have shown short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Chief Executive Officer responsible for the business, "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available for us in this hot phase.
All the more precise we will look at the final statements.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naïve there and have a long breath."
References to abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software uses to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA prepares for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvency than in the previous year?
The evaluations are going apart, but we are looking forward to the case and are already schooling our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of claims for insolvency funds".
The figures were still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.

Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness is broken down.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to park rules, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in Neukölln District, 5000 people celebrated an illegal Techno party at night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.

London (dpa) - English football player Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured their third place on the last day of the Premier League with a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.

Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanjahus are becoming more and more violent.
At night there have been violent conflicts.
On the night of Sunday, the Israeli police in Jerusalem have violently opposed participants in a demonstration against the rights-conservative head of government Benjamin Netanjahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in unrest, reported police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld.
The police used, among other things, watermen to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6000 people had gathered near Netanjahus headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called Netanjahu for resignation.
There were also participants in an area demonstration who supported Netanjahu, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested by police records near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying from a driving car pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanjahu was recently criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being presented with pre-fast locks and a lack of preparation for a second corona roll.
The Corona crisis has made the country's economy difficult to increase.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the corona virus in Israel was finally increasing to new record values.

Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon on the B58, a run-up accident called for nine lightly injured at Ahlen.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.

He's in the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several rescue cars took them to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea takes border town off to Corona Suspect Case
North Korea has so far seen a "litting success" in its own measures to defend the Coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports on a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked a big city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alert.
Should the suspect case be confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the shotout country.
North Korea had not registered any infection yet, according to its own data, and described its defence measures as "litting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of disease were identified by an "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person dropped to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation of the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and largely still mined military buffer zone from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports from the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea's military gave the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were studies of some people.
North Korea, according to its own information, called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo on Saturday, chaired by Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered as a preventative measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party should therefore examine the "outbreak" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe punishment.
According to estimates, some 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still before much summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the building plan for the large urban development-east project," says more incidentally in the middle of the city press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrade of the eastern city is nevertheless debated controversially until the end.
The majority are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from citizenship and then by administration and municipal council, is now not to fail after nearly ten years of preparation, criticised project gegner Reinhard Klein as "exclusive parliamentary opposition", "intellectual", "Spekulation", "ingredulation" and "conscious false statements".
"All think it's better to know," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List for one year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties in this position, he was: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is to be reorganised for 8,5 million euros, contrary to statements from the city administration according to grants, of which small is convinced.
The city will develop completely differently than projected in the town hall and by the promoters of the economy.
The city by its own strength and not an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It is also essentially the renovation of the technical town hall, the openness of the castle mountain, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a more small-scale urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health pollution caused by road transport, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city were not innocent that this would have to come because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise due to the neglect of regular bus traffic with thinned paces and due to little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of accession to the Climate Action Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban day care institutions and the request for inclusion in the government's Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but it is necessary to prevent Corona's protective measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season at ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the super sports cars can take up the regular operation, the first test rides were on.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking up his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old long-earner turned his first round on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really has been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his 25 years of experience in the GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other dazzlingly and we made enormous progress on the Lausitzring also from session to session."
Right there - on the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From 31 July the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 new series, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest of the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams poker, of course, with the tests a little," he says.
"Suddenly, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
By the beginning of November seven races will take place.
Present stand is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will grab into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision caught cold
According to press reports, the decision of the UK Government to place Spain's vacationers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Minister of Transport cold.
Grant Shapps is therefore currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided to take the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising numbers of Coronas in Spain, the London Cabinet lined the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine charges is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be returned to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on the right day holiday, only from Saturday August 1st, and has not been introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, has been regarded as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is the possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour member Diane Abbot.
"But no one seems to have bothered to say Grant Shapp's word."
Almost one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe baseline barrier, the number of infections in the country will rise again.
Virologists are responsible, above all, for the new spread of nightlife.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
The British Government is currently dissatisfied from unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular for British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new Corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.

Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten its world champion
Since it cannot be driven on the required number of continents, FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All the American races have been canceled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prixs during the week.
In October the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão will be driven.
On the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points on the Italian tradition race track in Imola.
The 2020 racing calendar includes 13 races, according to current level.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our 2020 plans," said Formula 1-Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races will be completed in the royal class of motorsports in this exceptional season.
The Formula 1 race is scheduled to finish its season in Asia.
The final racing calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the officially surveyed races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules demand races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least three continents for the award of the World Championships.

Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo region is much lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
They were prepared for the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: evil view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was present in the well-known Latight show by Stephen Colbert by video switch and in the interview she had in mind what she had in her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US-Latenight show by video switch.
She told of her fight against the powerful in the world, among other things.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "cheap look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg, with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement, has drawn attention to itself.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Summit last year.
Latight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She not only talked about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the powerful in the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shook.
"All things from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are on the road" she has experienced.
Head of State and leading politicians who ridiculed them in social media or even try to silence them, find them "exquisite" because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to them."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitter look.
At the UN Summit of 2019 in New York, for which the actor sailed across the Atlantic, her intense view was captured by the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was formed from the short clip, thus an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump-connected.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at this moment?
To the relatively open question by Stephen Colbert she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the ready answer, the experienced satirist Colbert probably had not expected and soon disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How are you?"-Rede on the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the Climate Change Conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a fast ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now, the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was a roller coaster.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid ascent - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
It should have been disputed, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for benevolent purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
==References====External links==
There followed a social descent.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the image surface.
He was supposed to live on the road temporarily when cemetery gardeners worked and spent a time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15 the teen started playing professionally and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Little later he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac together with his bluebreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed his shadows: Green did not take media, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green managed a surprisingly successful respect with an album inspired by religious themes in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac was swimming on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not achieve a bigger comeback until he re-started with a group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star that returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
